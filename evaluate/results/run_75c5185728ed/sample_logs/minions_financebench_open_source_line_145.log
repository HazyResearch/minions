--- Question ---
Does Verizon have a reasonably healthy liquidity profile based on its quick ratio for FY 2022? If the quick ratio is not relevant to measure liquidity, please state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
The quick ratio cannot be accurately calculated due to the lack of specific figures for current assets excluding inventory and current liabilities. Therefore, we cannot determine if Verizon has a reasonably healthy liquidity profile based on its quick ratio for FY 2022.

--- Ground Truth ---
['No. The quick ratio was approximately 0.54 for Verizon. It indicated that Verizon does not have a healthy liquidity profile.']
