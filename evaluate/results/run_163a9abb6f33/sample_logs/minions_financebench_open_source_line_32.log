--- Question ---
Does AMD have a reasonably healthy liquidity profile based on its quick ratio for FY22? If the quick ratio is not relevant to measure liquidity, please state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
Due to the absence of consistent and complete financial data, it is not possible to determine if AMD has a reasonably healthy liquidity profile based on its quick ratio for FY22. The quick ratio is relevant for measuring liquidity, but without the necessary data, its calculation and assessment cannot be performed.

--- Ground Truth ---
['Yes. The quick ratio is 1.57, calculated as (cash and cash equivalents+Short term investments+Accounts receivable, net+receivables from related parties)/ (current liabilities).']
