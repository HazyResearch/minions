  "question": "What drove operating margin change as of the FY22 for AMD? If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then please state that and explain why.",
  "predicted_answer": "AMD's operating margin in FY22 was influenced by several factors. Key drivers included the acquisition of Xilinx and Pensando, which led to increased amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and integration costs. The company also faced higher R&D and marketing expenses, driven by strategic investments and headcount growth. Market conditions, such as a weak PC market and inventory corrections, further impacted the margin. Additionally, strategic decisions like stock repurchase programs and changes in accounting policies related to GILTI tax and R&D capitalization affected the financial outcomes.",

    "The decrease in AMD's operating income was primarily driven by amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition"
