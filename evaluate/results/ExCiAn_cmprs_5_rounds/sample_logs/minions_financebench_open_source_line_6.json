  "correctness_reasoning": "The predicted quick ratio of 0.85 is outside the 10% tolerance range of the ground truth quick ratio of 0.96 (acceptable range: 0.864 to 1.056). Additionally, the conclusion about the liquidity position is different; the ground truth suggests a need for improvement, while the predicted answer suggests a less than ideal position."
