  "question": "Does 3M have a reasonably healthy liquidity profile based on its quick ratio for Q2 of FY2023? If the quick ratio is not relevant to measure liquidity, please state that and explain why.",
  "predicted_answer": "Based on the available data, 3M does not have a reasonably healthy liquidity profile for Q2 of FY2023, as indicated by a quick ratio of approximately 0.39. This suggests that 3M may struggle to cover its short-term liabilities with its most liquid assets.",
  "ground_truth": [
    "No. The quick ratio for 3M was 0.96 by Jun'23 close, which needs a bit of an improvement to touch the 1x mark"
