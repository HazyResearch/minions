  "question": "Does Adobe have an improving operating margin profile as of FY2022? If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then state that and explain why.",
  "predicted_answer": "Based on the available information, Adobe's operating margin profile appears to be stable or slightly improving as of FY2022. However, the lack of explicit data makes it difficult to provide a definitive answer. Additionally, operating margin may not be the most reliable metric for Adobe due to potential costs associated with security efforts.",
  "ground_truth": [
    "No the operating margins of Adobe have recently declined from 36.8% in FY 2021 to 34.6% in FY2022. A drop by 2.2% in a year."

  "correctness_reasoning": "The predicted answer incorrectly states that Adobe's operating margin profile is stable or slightly improving, which contradicts the ground truth that indicates a decline from 36.8% in FY2021 to 34.6% in FY2022. The stance on the operating margin trend does not match the ground truth, violating the evaluation rule for yes/no questions."
