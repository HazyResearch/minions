--- Question ---
Does Corning have positive working capital based on FY2022 data? If working capital is not a useful or relevant metric for this company, then please state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
Due to the inconsistency and incompleteness of the data regarding current assets and liabilities, it is not possible to reliably determine whether Corning has positive working capital based on FY2022 data.

--- Ground Truth ---
['Yes. Corning had a positive working capital amount of $831 million by FY 2022 close. This answer considers only operating current assets and current liabilities that were clearly shown in the balance sheet.']

--- Correctness Evaluation ---
Is correct: False
Confidence: 0.90
Reasoning: The predicted answer states that it is not possible to determine whether Corning has positive working capital due to data issues, while the ground truth answer clearly states that Corning had positive working capital of $831 million. The predicted answer does not match the stance of the ground truth answer, which is a requirement for yes/no questions.
