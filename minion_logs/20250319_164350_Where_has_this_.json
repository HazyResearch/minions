  "context": "I am a Postdoctoral Scholar at Stanford University, co-advised by Scott Linderman and Christopher Ré. I am also an academic partner with Databricks Mosaic AI, where I previously interned. I recently graduated from a PhD at Columbia’s Center for Theoretical Neuroscience, advised by John Cunningham and working closely with Liam Paninski.\n\nI build resource-efficient AI systems for science – in vision, timeseries, and text domains, fusing approaches from statistical ML and CS systems. Most notably, I worked on deep learning systems for tracking animal movement in videos - the Lightning Pose package (Nature Methods, 2024), scalability of Gaussian processes (ICML, 2021), and learning-forgetting tradeoffs in LLM finetuning for math and code generation (TMLR, 2024 (Featured Certification))\n\nThroughout my PhD, I collaborated closely with Lightning AI, named a Lightning Ambassador, and a featured developer in their first DevCon, June 2022.",
