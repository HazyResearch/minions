Are JPM's gross margins historically consistent (not fluctuating more than roughly 2% each year)? If gross margins are not a relevant metric for a company like this, then please state that and explain why.

Gross margins are not a relevant metric for JPMorgan Chase. Focus on net interest margin and ROA instead.

--- Ground Truth ---
['Since JPM is a financial institution, gross margin is not a relevant metric.']
