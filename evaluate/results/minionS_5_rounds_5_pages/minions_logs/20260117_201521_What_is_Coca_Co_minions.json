Total length: 673069 characters.: \n\n## Question\nWhat is Coca Cola's FY2022 dividend payout ratio (using total cash dividends paid and net income attributable to shareholders)? Round answer to two decimal places. Answer the question asked by assuming you only have access to information clearly displayed in the cash flow statement and the income statement.\n\n---\n\nPlease provide succinct advice on the critical information we need to extract from the Financial document. Total length: 673069 characters to answer this question. \n\nAlso consider the following constraints:\n- In your response do NOT use numbered lists.\n- Do NOT structure your response as a sequence of steps.\n",
      "output": "To determine Coca Cola's FY2022 dividend payout ratio, focus on extracting two key pieces of information from the financial document: the total cash dividends paid and the net income attributable to shareholders. These figures are typically found in the cash flow statement and the income statement, respectively. The total cash dividends paid can be located in the financing activities section of the cash flow statement, often labeled as \"dividends paid\" or \"cash dividends paid.\" The net income attributable to shareholders is usually presented at the bottom of the income statement, often labeled as \"net income\" or \"net income attributable to shareholders.\" Once you have these figures, calculate the dividend payout ratio by dividing the total cash dividends paid by the net income attributable to shareholders, and then multiply by 100 to express it as a percentage. Round the final result to two decimal places to meet the question's requirements."

      "prompt": "# Decomposition Round #1\n\nYou (the supervisor) cannot directly read the document(s). Instead, you can assign small, isolated tasks to a less capable worker model that sees only a single chunk of text at a time. Any cross-chunk or multi-document reasoning must be handled by you.\n\n## Your Job: Write Two Python Functions\n\n### FUNCTION #1: `prepare_jobs(context, prev_job_manifests, prev_job_outputs) -> List[JobManifest]`\n- Break the document(s) into chunks (using the provided chunking function, if needed). Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 12 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`. All **multi-chunk integration** or **global reasoning** is your responsibility here.\n- Return one **aggregated string** suitable for further supervisor inspection.\n\n\n\n## Relevant Pydantic Models\n\nThe following models are already in the global scope. **Do NOT redefine or re-import them.**\n\n### JobManifest Model\n```\nclass JobManifest(BaseModel):\n    chunk: str  # the actual text for the chunk of the document\n    task: str  # the actual task instruction for the small model\n    advice: str  # optional, any additional advice on how to perform the task\n\n    chunk_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    task_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    job_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n\n```\n\n### JobOutput Model\n```\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    citation: Optional[str]\n    answer: Optional[str]\n\n```\n\n## Function Signatures\n```\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        context (List[str]): A list of documents.

Management believes that these forward-looking statements are reasonable as and when made. However, caution should be taken not\nto place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements because such statements speak only as of the date when made. Our Company undertakes no obligation to\npublicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. In addition, forward-\nlooking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our Company’s actual results to differ materially from historical experience and our present\nexpectations or projections. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the possibility that the assumptions used to calculate our estimated aggregate\nincremental tax and interest liability related to the potential unfavorable outcome of the ongoing tax dispute with the United States Internal Revenue Service could significantly\nchange; those described in Part I, “Item 1A.

However, the absence of these words or similar expressions\ndoes not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. All statements that address operating performance, events or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the\nfuture — including statements relating to volume growth, share of sales and net income per share growth, and statements expressing general views about future operating\nresults — are forward-looking statements. Management believes that these forward-looking statements are reasonable as and when made. However, caution should be taken not\nto place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements because such statements speak only as of the date when made. Our Company undertakes no obligation to\npublicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. In addition, forward-\nlooking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our Company’s actual results to differ materially from historical experience and our present\nexpectations or projections. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the possibility that the assumptions used to calculate our estimated aggregate\nincremental tax and interest liability related to the potential unfavorable outcome of the ongoing tax dispute with the United States Internal Revenue Service could significantly\nchange; those described in Part I, “Item 1A.

Our competitive challenges include strong competitors in all geographic regions; in many\ncountries, a concentrated\n7\n\n\nretail sector with powerful buyers able to freely choose among Company products, products of competitive beverage suppliers and individual retailers’ own store or private-\nlabel beverage brands; new industry entrants; and dramatic shifts in consumer shopping methods and patterns due to a rapidly evolving digital landscape.\nRaw Materials\nWe and our bottling partners use various ingredients in our business, including high fructose corn syrup (“HFCS”), sucrose, aspartame, acesulfame potassium, sucralose,\nsaccharin, cyclamate, steviol glycosides, ascorbic acid, citric acid, phosphoric acid, caffeine and caramel color; other raw materials such as coffee, orange and other fruit juice\nand juice concentrates; packaging materials such as polyethylene terephthalate (“PET”), bio-based PET and recycled PET for bottles; and aluminum cans, glass bottles and\nother containers.\nWater is a main ingredient in substantially all of our products. While historically we have not experienced significant water supply difficulties, water is a limited natural\nresource in many parts of the world, and our Company recognizes water availability, quality and sustainability, for both our operations and also the communities where we\noperate, as one of the key challenges facing our business.\nIn addition to water, the principal raw materials used in our bu",

Retailers\nmay seek lower prices from us and our bottling partners, may demand increased marketing or promotional expenditures in support of their businesses, and may be more likely\nto use their distribution networks to introduce and develop private-label brands, any of which could negatively affect the Coca-Cola system’s profitability. In addition, in\ndeveloped markets, discounters and value stores are growing at a rapid pace, while in emerging and developing markets, modern trade is growing at a faster pace than\ntraditional trade outlets. Our industry is also being affected by the rapid growth in sales through e-commerce retailers, e-commerce websites, mobile commerce applications and\nsubscription services, which may result in a shift away from physical retail operations to digital channels. As we and our bottling partners build e-commerce capabilities, we\nmay not be able to develop and maintain successful relationships with existing and new e-commerce retailers without experiencing a deterioration of our relationships with key\ncustomers operating physical retail channels. If we are unable to successfully adapt to the rapidly changing retail landscape, including the rapid growth in digital commerce, our\nshare of sales, volume growth and overall financial results could be negatively affected. In addition, our success depends in part on our ability to maintain good relationships\nwith key retail and foodservice customers.

Additionally, we rely on local availability of talented management and employees to establish and manage our operations in these markets. Scarcity of, or heavy\ncompetition for, talented employees could impede our abilities in such markets.

Such actions could, in the long term, have an adverse effect on our profitability.\nIf our bottling partners’ financial condition deteriorates, our business and financial results could be affected.\nIn the vast majority of our markets, our products are sold and distributed by independent bottling partners, and we therefore derive a significant portion of our net operating\nrevenues from sales of concentrates and syrups to independent bottling partners. Accordingly, the success of our business depends in part on our bottling partners’ financial\nstrength and profitability. While under our agreements with our bottling partners we generally have the right to unilaterally change the prices we charge for our concentrates and\nsyrups, our ability to do so may be materially limited by our bottling partners’ financial condition and their ability to pass price increases along to their customers. In addition,\nwe have investments in certain of our bottling partners, which we account for under the equity method, and our operating results include our proportionate share of such\nbottling partners’ income or loss. Our bottling partners’ financial condition is affected in large part by conditions and events that are beyond our and their control, including\ncompetitive and general market conditions; the availability of capital and other financing resources on reasonable terms; loss of major customers; changes in or additional\nregulations; or disruptions of bottling operations that may be caused by strikes, work stoppages, labor unrest, natural disasters or other catastrophic events. A deterioration of\nthe financial condition or results of operations of one or more of our major bottling partners could adversely affect our net operating revenues from sales of concentrates and\nsyrups; and, if such deterioration involves one or more of our\n18\n\n\nequity method investee bottling partners, it could also result in a decrease in our equity income and/or impairments of our equity method investments.\nWe may from tim",

Management\nbelieves that, except as disclosed in “U.S. Federal Income Tax Dispute” below, the total liabilities of the Company that may arise as a result of currently pending legal\nproceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the Company taken as a whole.\nAqua-Chem Litigation\nOn December 20, 2002, the Company filed a lawsuit (The Coca-Cola Company v. Aqua-Chem, Inc., Civil Action No. 2002CV631-50) in the Superior Court of Fulton County,\nGeorgia (“Georgia Case”), seeking a declaratory judgment that the Company has no obligation to its former subsidiary, Aqua-Chem, Inc., now known as Cleaver-Brooks, Inc.\n(“Aqua-Chem”), for any past, present or future liabilities or expenses in connection with any claims or lawsuits against Aqua-Chem.

We concluded, based on the technical and legal merits of the Company’s tax positions, that it is more likely than not\nthe Company’s tax positions will ultimately be sustained on appeal. In addition, we considered a number of alternative transfer pricing methodologies, including the\nmethodology asserted by the IRS and affirmed in the Opinion (“Tax Court Methodology”), that could be applied by the courts upon final resolution of the litigation. Based on\nthe required probability analysis, we determined the methodologies we believe the federal courts could ultimately order to be used in calculating the Company’s tax. As a result\nof this analysis, we recorded a tax reserve of $438 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 related to the application of the resulting methodologies as well as the\ndifferent tax treatment applicable to dividends originally paid to the U.S. parent company by its foreign licensees, in reliance upon the Closing Agreement, that would be\nrecharacterized as royalties in accordance with the Opinion and the Company’s analysis.\nThe Company’s conclusion that it is more likely than not the Company’s tax positions will ultimately be sustained on appeal is unchanged as of December 31, 2022. However,\nwe updated our calculation of the methodologies we believe the federal courts\n28\n\n\ncould ultimately order to be used in calculating the Company’s tax. As a result of the application of the required probability analysis to these updated calculations and the\naccrual of interest through the current reporting period, we updated our tax reserve as of December 31, 2022 to $423 million.\nWhile the Company strongly disagrees with the IRS’ positions and the portions of the Opinion affirming such positions, it is possible that some portion or all of the adjustment\nproposed by the IRS and sustained by the Tax Court could ultimately be upheld. In that event, the Company would likely be subject to significant additional liabilities for tax\nyears 2007 through 2009, and potentially also for subsequent years, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, and\ncash flows.\nThe Company calculated the potential impact of applying the Tax Court Methodology to reallocate income from foreign licensees potentially covered within the scope of the\nOpinion, assuming such methodology were to be ultimately upheld by the courts, and the IRS were to decide to apply that methodology to subsequent years, with consent of the\nfederal courts. This impact would include taxes and interest accrued through December 31, 2022 for the 2007 through 2009 litigated tax years and for subsequent tax years from\n2010 through 2022. The calculations incorporated the estimated impact of correlative adjustments to the previously accrued transition tax payable under the Tax Reform Act.\nThe Company estimates that the potential aggregate incremental tax and interest liability could be app",

Additionally, the rapidly evolving digital\nlandscape and growth of e-commerce in many markets has led to dramatic shifts in consumer shopping habits and patterns. Consumers are rapidly embracing shopping via\nmobile device applications, e-commerce retailers and e-commerce websites or platforms, which presents new challenges to maintain the competitiveness and relevancy of our\nbrands. As a result, we must continuously strengthen our capabilities in marketing and innovation to compete in a digital environment and maintain brand loyalty and market\nshare. In addition, we are increasing our investments in e-commerce to support retail and meal delivery services, offering more package sizes that are fit-for-purpose for online\nsales, and shifting more consumer and trade promotions to digital.\nProduct Safety and Quality\nWe strive to meet the highest standards in both product safety and product quality. We are aware that some consumers have concerns and negative viewpoints regarding certain\ningredients used in our products. The Coca-Cola system works every day to produce high quality, safe and refreshing beverages for consumers around the world. We have\nrigorous product and ingredient safety and quality standards designed to ensure safety and quality in each of our products, and we drive innovation that provides new beverage\noptions to satisfy consumers’ evolving needs and preferences.\nWe work to ensure consistent safety and quality through strong governance and compliance with applicable regulations and standards. We stay current with new regulations,\nindustry best practices and marketplace conditions, and we engage with standard-setting and industry organizations. Additionally, we manufacture and distribute our products\naccording to strict policies, requirements and specifications set forth in an integrated quality management program that continually measures all operations within the Coca-\nCola system against the same stringent standards. Our quality management program also identifies and mitigates risks and drives improvement. In our quality laboratories, we\nstringently measure the quality attributes of ingredients as well as samples of finished products collected from the marketplace.\n35\n\n\nWe perform due diligence to ensure that product and ingredient safety and quality standards are maintained in the more than 200 countries and territories where our products are\nsold. We regularly assess the relevance of our requirements and standards and continually work to improve and refine them across our entire supply chain.\nSustainability Matters\nAs investors and stakeholders increasingly focus on sustainability matters, our Company and companies across all industries are facing challenges and risks related to, among\nother things, sustainable packaging; water stewardship; climate; health and nutrition; human rights; and diversity, equity and inclusion.

We monitor our mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt as well as our mix\nof short-term debt and long-term debt. From time to time, we enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations.\nBased on the Company’s variable-rate debt and derivative instruments outstanding as of December 31, 2022, we estimate that a 1 percentage point increase in interest rates\nwould have increased interest expense by $136 million in 2022. However, this increase in interest expense would have been partially offset by the increase in interest income\ndue to higher interest rates.\n58\n\n\nThe Company is subject to interest rate risk related to its investments in highly liquid debt securities. These investments are primarily managed by external managers within the\nguidelines of the Company’s investment policy. Our policy requires these investments to be investment grade, with the primary objective of minimizing the risk of principal\nloss. In addition, our policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. We estimate that a 1 percentage point increase in interest rates would have resulted in a $29\nmillion decrease in the fair value of our portfolio of highly liquid debt securities.\nCommodity Prices\nThe Company is subject to market risk with respect to commodity price fluctuations, principally related to our purch",

Additionally, there are situations in which consolidation is required even\nthough the usual condition of consolidation (i.e., ownership of a majority voting interest) does not apply. Generally, this occurs when an entity holds an interest in another\nbusiness enterprise that was achieved through arrangements that do not involve voting interests, which results in a disproportionate relationship between such entity’s voting\ninterests in, and its exposure to the economic risks and potential rewards of, the other business enterprise.

These estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without\ninterest charges) is less than the carrying amount, we recognize an impairment charge. The impairment charge recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the\nasset or asset group exceeds the fair value. We use a variety of methodologies to determine the fair value of these assets, including discounted cash flow models, which include\nassumptions we believe are consistent with those a market participant would use.\nWe test intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives, including trademarks, franchise rights and goodwill, for impairment annually, or more frequently if events\nor circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired.

As a result\nof this analysis, we recorded a tax reserve of $438 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 related to the application of the resulting methodologies as well as the\ndifferent tax treatment applicable to dividends originally paid to the U.S. parent company by its foreign licensees, in reliance upon the Closing Agreement, that would be\nrecharacterized as royalties in accordance with the Opinion and the Company’s analysis.\nThe Company’s conclusion that it is more likely than not the Company’s tax positions will ultimately be sustained on appeal is unchanged as of December 31, 2022.

In that event, the Company would likely be subject to significant additional liabilities for tax\nyears 2007 through 2009, and potentially also for subsequent years, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, and\ncash flows.\nThe Company calculated the potential impact of applying the Tax Court Methodology to reallocate income from foreign licensees potentially covered within the scope of the\nOpinion, assuming such methodology were to be ultimately upheld by the courts, and the IRS were to decide to apply that methodology to subsequent years, with consent of the\nfederal courts.

We also considered our intention to vigorously defend our positions and assert our various well-\nfounded legal claims via every available avenue of appeal. We concluded, based on the technical and legal merits of the Company’s tax positions, that it is more likely than not\nthe Company’s tax positions will ultimately be sustained on appeal. In addition, we considered a number of alternative transfer pricing methodologies, including the\nmethodology asserted by the IRS and affirmed in the Opinion (“Tax Court Methodology”), that could be applied by the courts upon final resolution of the litigation. Based on\nthe required probability analysis, we determined the methodologies we believe the federal courts could ultimately order to be used in calculating the Company’s tax. As a result\nof this analysis, we recorded a tax reserve of $438 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 related to the application of the resulting methodologies as well as the\ndifferent tax treatment applicable to dividends originally paid to the U.S. parent company by its foreign licensees, in reliance upon the Closing Agreement, that would be\nrecharacterized as royalties in accordance with the Opinion and the Company’s analysis.\nThe Company’s conclusion that it is more likely than not the Company’s tax positions will ultimately be sustained on appeal is unchanged as of December 31, 2022. However,\nwe updated our calculation of the methodologies we believe the federal courts could ultimately order to be used in calculating the Company’s tax. As a result of the application\nof the required probability analysis to these updated calculations and the accrual of interest through the current reporting period, we updated our tax reserve as of December 31,\n2022 to $423 million.\nWhile the Company strongly disagrees with the IRS’ positions and the portions of the Opinion affirming such positions, it is possible that some portion or all of the adjustment\nproposed by the IRS and sustained by the Tax Court could ultimately be upheld. In that event, the Company would likely be subject to significant additional liabilities for tax\nyears 2007 through 2009, and potentially also for subsequent years, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, and\ncash flows.\nThe Company calculated the potential impact of applying the Tax Court Methodology to reallocate income from foreign licensees potentially covered within the scope of the\nOpinion, assuming such methodology were to be ultimately upheld by the courts, and the IRS were to decide to apply that methodology to subsequent years, with consent of the\nfederal courts.

For other non-U.S. plans, we base the discount rate assumption on comparable\nindices within each of the countries. The Company measures the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost or income for pension and other\npostretirement benefit plans by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the plans’ projected benefit cash flows. The rate of compensation increase assumption is\ndetermined by the Company based upon annual reviews.\nThe cash balance interest crediting rate for the U.S. qualified pension plan is based on the yield on six-month U.S. Treasury bills on the last day of September of the previous\nplan year, plus 150 basis points, with a minimum interest crediting rate of 3.80 percent for all active employees and certain former employees. The Company assumes that the\nultimate interest crediting rate is 140 basis points lower than the plan’s year-end discount rate and that the current interest crediting rate will converge with the ultimate interest\ncrediting rate after a period of 10 years.\nThe expected long-term rate of return assumption for U.S. pension plan assets is based upon the target asset allocation and is determined using forward-looking assumptions in\nthe context of historical returns and volatilities for each asset class, as well as correlations among asset classes. We evaluate the expected long-term rate of return assumption on\nan annual basis. The expected long-term rate of return assumption used in computing 2022 net periodic benefit income for the U.S. pension plans was 6.75 percent.

For other non-U.S. plans, we base the discount rate assumption on comparable\nindices within each of the countries. The Company measures the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost or income for pension and other\npostretirement benefit plans by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the plans’ projected benefit cash flows. The rate of compensation increase assumption is\ndetermined by the Company based upon annual reviews.\nThe cash balance interest crediting rate for the U.S. qualified pension plan is based on the yield on six-month U.S. Treasury bills on the last day of September of the previous\nplan year, plus 150 basis points, with a minimum interest crediting rate of 3.80 percent for all active employees and certain former employees. The Company assumes that the\nultimate interest crediting rate is 140 basis points lower than the plan’s year-end discount rate and that the current interest crediting rate will converge with the ultimate interest\ncrediting rate after a period of 10 years.\nThe expected long-term rate of return assumption for U.S. pension plan assets is based upon the target asset allocation and is determined using forward-looking assumptions in\nthe context of historical returns and volatilities for each asset class, as well as correlations among asset classes. We evaluate the expected long-term rate of return assumption on\nan annual basis. The expected long-term rate of return assumption used in computing 2022 net periodic benefit income for the U.S. pension plans was 6.75 percent. As of\nDecember 31, 2022, the 5-year, 10-year and 15-year annualized return for the U.S. pension plan assets was ",

Additionally, the inputs used to measure fair value are prioritized based\non a three-level hierarchy. This hierarchy requires entities to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The three levels of inputs used\nto measure fair value are as follows:\n• Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n• Level 2 — Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1. We value assets and liabilities included in this level using dealer and broker quotations,\ncertain pricing models, bid prices, quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by\nobservable market data.\n• Level 3 — Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.

In addition, our Company’s Board of Directors adopted a written\nCode of Business Conduct for Non-Employee Directors which reflects the same principles and values as our Code of Business Conduct for officers and employees but focuses\non matters of relevance to non-employee Directors.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and, even when determined to be effective, can only\nprovide reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject\nto the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under\nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”). Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,\n2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework)\n(“COSO”) in Internal Control—Integrated Framework. Based on this assessment, management believes that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial\nreporting as of December 31, 2022.\nThe Company’s independent auditors, Ernst & Young LLP, a registered public accounting firm, are appointed by the Audit Committee of our Company’s Board of Directors,\nsubject to ratification by our Company’s shareowners.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that\n(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that\ntransactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company\nare being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of\nunauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are\nsubject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nAtlanta, Georgia\nFebruary 21, 2023\n128\n\n\nITEM 9.  CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNT",

      "output": "### Analysis\n\n1. **Information Gathered:**\n   - **Dividends Paid:** The outputs did not provide a specific figure for the total cash dividends paid. Most responses were either \"None\" or irrelevant to the task.\n   - **Net Income Attributable to Shareholders:** Several outputs provided figures for net income, with the most consistent figure being \\$9,542 million for 2022, as cited in multiple responses.\n\n2. **Sufficiency of Information:**\n   - The information is **not sufficient** to calculate the dividend payout ratio because we do not have the total cash dividends paid for FY2022. While we have a consistent figure for net income, the absence of the dividends paid figure prevents us from completing the calculation.\n\n3. **Missing Information:**\n   - We specifically need the total cash dividends paid by Coca Cola in FY2022. This figure is typically found in the cash flow statement under financing activities.\n\n4. **Calculation (if sufficient information were available):**\n   - If we had the total cash dividends paid, the dividend payout ratio would be calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Dividend Payout Ratio} = \\left(\\frac{\\text{Total Cash Dividends Paid}}{\\text{Net Income Attributable to Shareholders}}\\right) \\times 100\n     \\]\n   - With the net income figure of \\$9,542 million, we would substitute the dividends paid figure into the formula to get the ratio.\n\n5. **Conflicting Answers:**\n   - There are no conflicting answers regarding the net income figure, as multiple outputs consistently cited \\$9,542 million. However, the lack of a dividends paid figure is the primary issue.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTo answer the question, we need to extract the total cash dividends paid from the financial document. Without this information, we cannot calculate the dividend payout ratio. Further investigation into the cash flow statement is necessary to find this missing piece of data."

Given the constraints and the need for atomic tasks, we will create tasks to extract these figures separately from each chunk of the document.\n\nHere's how we can implement the two functions:\n\n```python\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    job_manifests = []\n    task_id_dividends = 1  # Unique identifier for extracting dividends\n    task_id_net_income = 2  # Unique identifier for extracting net income\n\n    # Chunk the document into manageable sections\n    for doc in context:\n        chunks = chunk_by_section(doc, max_chunk_size=3000, overlap=20)\n        \n        for chunk in chunks:\n            # Task to extract total cash dividends paid\n            task_dividends = \"Extract the total cash dividends paid from this chunk.\"\n            job_manifest_dividends = JobManifest(\n                chunk=chunk,\n                task=task_dividends,\n                advice=\"Look for terms like 'dividends paid' or 'cash dividends paid' in the cash flow statement.\",\n                task_id=task_id_dividends\n            )\n            job_manifests.append(job_manifest_dividends)\n\n            # Task to extract net income attributable to shareholders\n            task_net_income = \"Extract the net income attributable to shareholders from this chunk.\"\n            job_manifest_net_income = JobManifest(\n                chunk=chunk,\n                task=task_net_income,\n                advice=\"Look for terms like 'net income' or 'net income attributable to shareholders' in the income statement.\",\n                task_id=task_id_net_income\n            )\n            job_manifests.append(job_manifest_net_income)\n\n    return job_manifests\n\ndef transform_outputs(\n    jobs: List[Job],\n) -> str:\n    def filter_fn(job):\n        return job.output.answer is not None and job.output.answer.strip() != \"\"\n\n    # Filter jobs\n    for job in jobs:\n        job.include = filter_fn(job)\n\n    # Aggregate and filter jobs\n    tasks = {}\n    for job in jobs:\n        task_id = job.manifest.task_id\n        chunk_id = job.manifest.chunk_id\n\n        if task_id not in tasks:\n            tasks[task_id] = {\n                \"task_id\": task_id,\n                \"task\": job.manifest.task,\n                \"chunks\": {},\n            }\n\n        if chunk_id not in tasks[task_id][\"chunks\"]:\n            tasks[task_id][\"chunks\"][chunk_id] = []\n\n        tasks[task_id][\"chunks\"][chunk_id].append(job)\n\n    # Build the aggregated string\n    aggregated_str = \"\"\n    for task_id, task_info in tasks.items():\n        aggregated_str += f\"## Task (task_id=`{task_id}`): {task_info['task']}\\n\\n\"\n\n        for chunk_id, chunk_jobs in task_info[\"chunks\"].items():\n            filtered_jobs = [j for j in chunk_jobs if j.include]\n\n            aggregated_str += f\"### Chunk # {chunk_id}\\n\"\n            if filtered_jobs:\n                for idx, job in enumerate(filtered_jobs, start=1):\n                    aggregated_str += f\"   -- Job {idx} (job_id=`{job.manifest.job_id}`):\\n\"\n                    aggregated_str += f\"   {job.sample}\\n\\n\"\n            else:\n                aggregated_str += \"   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\\n\\n\"\n\n        aggregated_str += \"\\n-----------------------\\n\\n\"\n\n    return aggregated_str\n```\n\nIn this implementation, `prepare_jobs` creates tasks to extract the necessary financial figures from each chunk of the document. Each task is atomic, focusing on either the total cash dividends paid or the net income attributable to shareholders. The `transform_outputs` function then filters and aggregates the results, ensuring that only relevant and non-empty outputs are included in the final aggregated string."

These investments are intended to result in increases in unit case volume, net operating revenues and profits at the bottler level, which in turn generate increased\nsales for our Company’s concentrate operations. When our equity investment provides us with the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee bottler’s operating\nand financial policies, we account for the investment under the equity method.\nSeasonality\nSales of our ready-to-drink beverages are somewhat seasonal, with the second and third calendar quarters historically accounting for the highest sales volumes. The volume of\nsales in the beverage business may be affected by weather conditions.\nCompetition\nThe commercial beverage industry is highly competitive and consists of numerous companies, ranging from small or emerging to very large and well established. These include\ncompanies that, like our Company, compete globally in multiple geographic areas, as well as businesses that are primarily regional or local in operation. Competitive products\ninclude numerous nonalcoholic sparkling soft drinks; water products, including flavored and enhanced waters; juices, juice drinks and nectars; dilutables (including syrups and\npowders); coffees; teas; energy drinks; sports drinks; milk and other dairy-based drinks; plant-based beverages; functional beverages, including vitamin-based products and\nrelaxation beverages; and various other nonalcoholic beverages. These competitive products are sold to consumers in both ready-to-drink and non-ready-to-drink form. The\nCompany has directly entered the alcohol beverage category in numerous markets outside the United States. In the United States, the Company has authorized alcohol-licensed\nthird parties to use certain of our trademarks and related intellectual property on alcohol beverages that contain Company beverage bases.

Moreover, even\nsecurity measures that are deemed adequate, appropriate, reasonable or in accordance with applicable legal requirements may not protect the information we maintain against\nincreasingly sophisticated attacks. In addition to potential fines, we could be subject to mandatory corrective action due to a cybersecurity incident, which could adversely\naffect our business operations and result in substantial costs for years to come. While we have purchased cybersecurity insurance, there are no assurances that the coverage\nwould be adequate in relation to any incurred losses.

The Company obtained a summary\njudgment in its favor on a different matter related to Mexican foreign tax credits, which thereafter effectively reduced the IRS’ potential tax adjustment by $138 million.\nThe trial was held in the Tax Court from March through May 2018, and final post-trial briefs were filed and exchanged in April 2019.\nOn November 18, 2020, the Tax Court issued the Opinion in which it predominantly sided with the IRS but agreed with the Company that dividends previously paid by the\nforeign licensees to the U.S. parent company in reliance upon the Closing Agreement should continue to be allowed to offset royalties, including those that would become\npayable to the Company in accordance with the Opinion.

The matter remains subject to the IRS’ litigation designation,\npreventing the Company from any attempt to settle or otherwise mutually resolve the matter with the IRS.\nThe Company consequently initiated litigation by filing a petition in the Tax Court in December 2015, challenging the tax adjustments enumerated in the Notice.\nPrior to trial, the IRS increased its transfer pricing adjustment by $385 million, resulting in an additional tax adjustment of $135 million. The Company obtained a summary\njudgment in its favor on a different matter related to Mexican foreign tax credits, which thereafter effectively reduced the IRS’ potential tax adjustment by $138 million.\nThe trial was held in the Tax Court from March through May 2018, and final post-trial briefs were filed and exchanged in April 2019.\nOn November 18, 2020, the Tax Court issued the Opinion in which it predominantly sided with the IRS but agreed with the Company that dividends previously paid by the\nforeign licensees to the U.S. parent company in reliance upon the Closing Agreement should continue to be allowed to offset royalties, including those that would become\npayable to the Company in accordance with the Opinion. The Tax Court reserved ruling on the effect of Brazilian legal restrictions on the payment of royalties by the\nCompany’s licensee in Brazil until after the Tax Court issues its opinion in the separate case of 3M Co. & Subs. v. Commissioner, T.C. Docket No. 5816-13 (filed March 11,\n2013). The Tax Court issued its opinion in 3M Co.’s case (“3M Co. opinion”) on February 9, 2023. Once the Tax Court completes its analysis of the application of the 3M Co.\nopinion to the Company’s case, the Company expects the Tax Court to render another opinion, and ultimately a final decision, in the Company’s case.\nThe Company believes that the IRS and the Tax Court misinterpreted and misapplied the applicable regulations in reallocating income earned by the Company’s foreign\nlicensees to increase the Company’s U.S. tax. Moreover, the Company believes that the retroactive imposition of such tax liability using a calculation methodology different\nfrom that previously agreed upon by the IRS and the Company, and audited by the IRS for over a decade, is unconstitutional. The Company intends to assert its claims on\nappeal and vigorously defend its position.\nIn determining the amount of tax reserve to be recorded as of December 31, 2020, the Company completed the required two-step evaluation process prescribed by Accounting\nStandards Codification 740, Accounting for Income Taxes. In doing so, we consulted with outside advisors, and we reviewed and considered relevant laws, rules, and\nregulations, including, but not limited to, the Opinion and relevant caselaw.

Challenges and risks accompany those opportunities. Our management has identified certain\nchallenges and risks that demand the attention of our Company and the commercial beverage industry. Of these, five key challenges and risks are discussed below.\nObesity\nObesity continues to impact communities and countries worldwide. There is growing concern among consumers, public health professionals and governments about the health\nproblems associated with obesity. This concern represents a significant challenge to our industry. We understand that obesity is a complex public health challenge, and we are\ncommitted to being a part of the solution.\nWe recognize the uniqueness of consumers’ lifestyles and dietary choices. Therefore, we continue to:\n• offer an expanded portfolio of beverage choices, including reduced-, low- and no-calorie beverage options;\n• provide transparent nutrition information, featuring calories on the front of most of our packages;\n• provide our beverages in a range of packaging sizes, including small sizes to enable portion control; and\n• market responsibly, including no advertising targeted to children under 13.\nThe heritage of our Company is to lead, and innovation is critical for leadership. As such, we are resolute in continuing to innovate and are committed to partnering to find\nwinning solutions in the area of noncaloric sweeteners. This includes working to reduce sugar and calories in many of our beverages. We want to be a helpful and credible\npartner in the fight against obesity.

Challenges and risks accompany those opportunities. Our management has identified certain\nchallenges and risks that demand the attention of our Company and the commercial beverage industry. Of these, five key challenges and risks are discussed below.\nObesity\nObesity continues to impact communities and countries worldwide. There is growing concern among consumers, public health professionals and governments about the health\nproblems associated with obesity. This concern represents a significant challenge to our industry. We understand that obesity is a complex public health challenge, and we are\ncommitted to being a part of the solution.\nWe recognize the uniqueness of consumers’ lifestyles and dietary choices. Therefore, we continue to:\n• offer an expanded portfolio of beverage choices, including reduced-, low- and no-calorie beverage options;\n• provide transparent nutrition information, featuring calories on the front of most of our packages;\n• provide our beverages in a range of packaging sizes, including small sizes to enable portion control; and\n• market responsibly, including no advertising targeted to children under 13.\nThe heritage of our Company is to lead, and innovation is critical for leadership. As such, we are resolute in continuing to innovate and are committed to partnering to find\nwinning solutions in the area of noncaloric sweeteners. This includes working to reduce sugar and calories in many of our beverages. We want to be a helpful and credible\npartner in the fight against obesity. Across the Coca-Cola system, we are mobilizing our assets in marketing and in community outreach to increase awareness and spur action.\nEvolving Consumer Product Preferences\nWe are impacted by shifting consumer demographics and needs, on-the-go lifestyles and consumers who are empowered with more information than ever.

Unit case volume consists primarily of beverage products\nbearing Company trademarks. Also included in unit case volume are certain brands licensed to, or distributed by, our Company, and brands owned by Coca-Cola system\nbottlers for which our Company provides marketing support and from the sale of which we derive an economic benefit. In addition, unit case volume includes sales by certain\njoint ventures in which the Company has an ownership interest. We believe unit case volume is one of the indicators of the underlying strength of the Coca-Cola system\nbecause it measures demand for our products at the consumer level. The unit case volume numbers used in this report are derived based on estimates received by the Company\nfrom its bottling partners and distributors. Concentrate sales volume represents the amount of concentrates, syrups, source waters and powders/minerals (in all instances\nexpressed in unit case equivalents) sold by, or used in finished beverages sold by, the Company to its bottling partners or other customers.

In 2022, equity income was $1,472\nmillion, compared to equity income of $1,438 million in 2021, an increase of $34 million, or 2 percent. The increase was primarily due to more favorable operating results\nreported by several of our equity method investees in the current year, partially offset by an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact and the sale of all or a portion of\nour ownership interest in certain equity method investees.

These values included\nderivative instruments that were designated and qualified for hedge accounting along with derivative instruments that are economic hedges. The fair value of foreign currency\nderivatives that qualified for hedge accounting resulted in a net unrealized loss of $66 million as of December 31, 2022, and we estimate that a 10 percent weakening of the\nU.S. dollar would have increased the net unrealized loss to $296 million.

We own and market five of the world’s\ntop six nonalcoholic sparkling soft drink brands: Coca-Cola, Sprite, Fanta, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar and Diet Coke/Coca-Cola Light. Finished beverage products bearing our\ntrademarks, sold in the United States since 1886, are now sold in more than 200 countries and territories.\nWe make our branded beverage products available to consumers throughout the world through our network of independent bottling partners, distributors, wholesalers and\nretailers as well as the Company’s consolidated bottling and distribution operations.

Furthermore, when testing assets for\nimpairment in future periods, if management uses different assumptions or if different conditions occur, impairment charges may result.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nOur Company consolidates all entities that we control by ownership of a majority voting interest. Additionally, there are situations in which consolidation is required even\nthough the usual condition of consolidation (i.e., ownership of a majority voting interest) does not apply. Generally, this occurs when an entity holds an interest in another\nbusiness enterprise that was achieved through arrangements that do not involve voting interests, which results in a disproportionate relationship between such entity’s voting\ninterests in, and its exposure to the economic risks and potential rewards of, the other business enterprise.

The Company may also designate certain non-\nderivative instruments, such as our foreign currency denominated third-party debt, in hedging relationships.\nAll derivative instruments are carried at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet, primarily in the following line items, as applicable: prepaid expenses and other current\nassets; other noncurrent assets; accounts payable and accrued expenses; and other noncurrent liabilities. The carrying values of the derivatives reflect the impact of legally\nenforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral held or placed with the same counterparties, as applicable. These master netting agreements allow the Company to\nnet settle positive and negative positions (assets and liabilities) arising from different transactions with the same counterparty.\nThe accounting for gains and losses that result from changes in the fair values of derivative instruments depends on whether the derivatives have been designated and qualify as\nhedging instruments and the type of hedging relationships. Derivatives can be designated as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign\noperations. The changes in the fair values of derivatives that have been designated and qualify for fair value hedge accounting are recorded in the same line item in our\nconsolidated statement of income as the changes in the fair values of the hedged items attributable to the risk being hedged.

The changes in fair values of derivatives designated as fair value hedges and the\noffsetting changes in fair values of the hedged items are recognized in earnings. As a result, any difference is reflected in earnings as ineffectiveness. When a derivative is no\nlonger designated as a fair value hedge for any reason, including termination and maturity, the remaining unamortized difference between the carrying value of the hedged item\nat that time and the face value of the hedged item is amortized to ear",

Litigation designation is an IRS determination that forecloses to a company any and all alternative\nmeans for resolution of a tax dispute. As a result of the IRS’ designation of the Company’s matter for litigation, the Company was forced to either accept the IRS’ newly\nimposed tax assessment and pay the full amount of the asserted tax or litigate the matter in the federal courts. The matter remains subject to the IRS’ litigation designation,\npreventing the Company from any attempt to settle or otherwise mutually resolve the matter with the IRS.\nThe Company consequently initiated litigation by filing a petition in the U.S. Tax Court (“Tax Court”) in December 2015, challenging the tax adjustments enumerated in the\nNotice.\nPrior to trial, the IRS increased its transfer pricing adjustment by $385 million, resulting in an additional tax adjustment of $135 million. The Company obtained a summary\njudgment in its favor on a different matter related to Mexican foreign tax credits, which thereafter effectively reduced the IRS’ potential tax adjustment by $138 million.\nThe trial was held in the Tax Court from March through May 2018, and final post-trial briefs were filed and exchanged in April 2019.\nOn November 18, 2020, the Tax Court issued an opinion (“Opinion”) in which it predominantly sided with the IRS but agreed with the Company that dividends previously paid\nby the foreign licensees to the U.S. parent company in reliance upon the Closing Agreement should continue to be allowed to offset royalties, including those that would\nbecome payable to the Company in accordance with the Opinion. The Tax Court reserved ruling on the effect of Brazilian legal restrictions on the payment of royalties by the\nCompany’s licensee in Brazil until after the Tax Court issues its opinion in the separate case of 3M Co. & Subs. v. Commissioner, T.C. Docket No. 5816-13 (filed March 11,\n2013). The Tax Court issued its opinion in 3M Co.’s case (“3M Co. opinion”) on February 9, 2023. Once the Tax Court completes its analysis of the application of the 3M Co.\nopinion to the Company’s case, the Company expects the Tax Court to render another opinion, and ultimately a final decision, in the Company’s case.\nThe Company believes that the IRS and the Tax Court misinterpreted and misapplied the applicable regulations in reallocating income earned by the Company’s foreign\nlicensees to increase the Company’s U.S. tax. Moreover, the Company believes that the retroactive imposition of such tax liability using a calculation methodology different\nfrom that previously agreed upon by the IRS and the Company, and audited by the IRS for over a decade, is unconstitutional.

As a result of the IRS’ designation of the Company’s matter for litigation, the Company was forced to either accept the IRS’ newly\nimposed tax assessment and pay the full amount of the asserted tax or litigate the matter in the federal courts. The matter remains subject to the IRS’ litigation designation,\npreventing the Company from any attempt to settle or otherwise mutually resolve the matter with the IRS.\nThe Company consequently initiated litigation by filing a petition in the U.S. Tax Court (“Tax Court”) in December 2015, challenging the tax adjustments enumerated in the\nNotice.\nPrior to trial, the IRS increased its transfer pricing adjustment by $385 million, resulting in an additional tax adjustment of $135 million. The Company obtained a summary\njudgment in its favor on a different matter related to Mexican foreign tax credits, which thereafter effectively reduced the IRS’ potential tax adjustment by $138 million.\nThe trial was held in the Tax Court from March through May 2018, and final post-trial briefs were filed and exchanged in April 2019.\nOn November 18, 2020, the Tax Court issued an opinion (“Opinion”) in which it predominantly sided with the IRS but agreed with the Company that dividends previously paid\nby the foreign licensees to the U.S. parent company in reliance upon the Closing Agreement should continue to be allowed to offset royalties, including those that would\nbecome payable to the Company in accordance with the Opinion. The Tax Court reserved ruling on the effect of Brazilian legal restrictions on the payment of royalties by the\nCompany’s licensee in Brazil until after the Tax Court issues its opinion in the separate case of 3M Co. & Subs. v. Commissioner, T.C. Docket No. 5816-13 (filed March 11,\n2013). The Tax Court issued its opinion in 3M Co.’s case (“3M Co. opinion”) on February 9, 2023. Once the Tax Court completes its analysis of the application of the 3M Co.\nopinion to the Company’s case, the Company expects the Tax Court to render another opinion, and ultimately a final decision, in the Company’s case.\nThe Company believes that the IRS and the Tax Court misinterpreted and misapplied the applicable regulations in reallocating income earned by the Company’s foreign\nlicensees to increase the Company’s U.S. tax. Moreover, the Company believes that the retroactive imposition of such tax liability using a calculation methodology different\nfrom that previously agreed upon by the IRS and the Company, and audited by the IRS for over a decade, is unconstitutional. The Company intends to assert its claims on\nappeal and vigorously defend its position.\nIn determining the amount of tax reserve to be recorded as of December 31, 2020, the Company completed the required two-step evaluation process prescr",

For performance share unit awards granted to executives in 2022, the performance criteria were weighted 30\npercent for net operating revenues, 30 percent for earnings per share, 30 percent for free cash flow and 10 percent for environmental sustainability. For purposes of these\nperformance criteria, earnings per share is diluted net income per share; free cash flow is net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and\nequipment; and environmental sustainability is comprised of predefined goals related to the Company’s packaging and water security strategies.

As described in Note 11, on September 17, 2015 the\nCompany received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency from the Internal Revenue Service for the tax years 2007 through 2009 in the amount of $3.3 billion for the period. On\nNovember 18, 2020, the U.S. Tax Court issued an opinion predominantly siding with the IRS related to the Company’s transfer pricing between its U.S. parent company\nand certain of its foreign affiliates for tax years 2007 through 2009.\nWhile the Company continues to disagree with the IRS positions and the portions of the opinion affirming such positions, it is possible that some portion or all of the\nadjustment proposed by the IRS could ultimately be upheld. As a result of the application of ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes, the Company has recorded a tax\nreserve of $423 million for this matter as of December 31, 2022.\nAuditing management’s evaluation of uncertain tax positions, including the uncertain tax posit",

We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit\ncommittee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The\ncommunication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit\nmatters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nAccounting for uncertain tax positions\nDescription of the\nMatter\nAs described in Note 11 and Note 14 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements, the Company is involved in various income tax matters for which the ultimate\noutcomes are uncertain. As of December 31, 2022, the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $926 million. As described in Note 11, on September 17, 2015 the\nCompany received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency from the Internal Revenue Service for the tax years 2007 through 2009 in the amount of $3.3 billion for the period. On\nNovember 18, 2020, the U.S. Tax Court issued an opinion predominantly siding with the IRS related to the Company’s transfer pricing between its U.S. parent company\nand certain of its foreign affiliates for tax years 2007 through 2009.\nWhile the Company continues to disagree with the IRS positions and the portions of the opinion affirming such positions, it is possible that some portion or all of the\nadjustment proposed by the IRS could ultimately be upheld. As a result of the application of ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes, the Company has recorded a tax\nreserve of $423 million for this matter as of December 31, 2022.\nAuditing management’s evaluation of uncertain tax positions, including the uncertain tax posit",

Our\nprocedures included testing controls addressing the completeness of uncertain tax positions, controls relating to the identification and recognition of the uncertain tax\npositions, controls over the measurement of the unrecognized tax benefit, and controls over the identification of developments related to existing uncertain tax positions.\nOur audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the assumptions the Company used to assess its uncertain tax positions and related unrecognized tax benefit\namounts by jurisdiction. We also tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the identification and measurement of uncertain tax positions. We\nevaluated evidence of management’s assessment of the opinion, including inquiries of tax counsel, inspection of technical memos, and written representations of\nmanagement. We involved professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in our evaluation of the tax technical merits of the Company’s assessment,\nincluding the assessment of whether the tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained, the amount of the potential benefits to be realized, and the application of\nrelevant tax law. We also assessed the Company’s disclosure of uncertain tax positions included in Note 11 and Note 14.\nValuation of trademarks with indefinite lives and goodwill\nDescription of the\nMatter\nAs described in Note 1 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements, the Company performs an annual impairment test of its indefinite-lived intangible assets,\nincluding trademarks with indefinite lives and goodwill, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired. Each impairment test may be\nqualitative or quantitative. Trademarks with indefinite lives and goodwill were $14.2 billion and $18.8 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2022.\nAuditing the valuation of trademarks with indefinite lives and reporting units with goodwill involved complex judgment due to the significant estimation required in\ndetermining the fair value of the trademarks with indefinite lives and related reporting units with goodwill, respectively. Specifically, the fair value estimates were\nsensitive to significant assumptions about future market and economic conditions. Significant assumptions used in the Company’s fair value estimates included sales\nvolume, pricing, royalty rates, long-term growth rates, and cost of capital, as applicable.\nHow We Addressed the\nMatter in Our Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, ev",
