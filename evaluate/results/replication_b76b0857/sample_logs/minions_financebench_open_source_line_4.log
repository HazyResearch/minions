--- Question ---
What drove operating margin change as of FY2022 for 3M? If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then please state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
The operating margin for 3M decreased from 22.3% in FY2021 to 20.8% in FY2022, influenced by litigation costs, raw material and logistics costs, and special items like divestitures and restructuring actions.

--- Ground Truth ---
['Operating Margin for 3M in FY2022 has decreased by 1.7% primarily due to: \n-Decrease in gross Margin\n-mostly one-off charges including Combat Arms Earplugs litigation, impairment related to exiting PFAS manufacturing, costs related to exiting Russia and divestiture-related restructuring\ncharges']

--- Correctness Evaluation ---

Confidence: 0.90
Reasoning: The predicted answer correctly identifies the decrease in operating margin and attributes it to litigation costs, special items like divestitures and restructuring actions, which aligns with the ground truth. Although it mentions raw material and logistics costs instead of gross margin decrease, the overall key factors and conclusion are consistent with the ground truth.
