  "question": "Roughly how many times has JnJ sold its inventory in FY2022? Calculate inventory turnover ratio for FY2022; if conventional inventory management is not meaningful for the company then state that and explain why.",
  "predicted_answer": "The inventory turnover ratio for J&J in FY2022 cannot be calculated accurately due to missing average inventory data. However, the COGS is $31,089 million. Conventional inventory management may not be meaningful for J&J due to its complex business model, global supply chain, reliance on third-party manufacturers, and various external factors such as currency fluctuations and supply constraints.",
  "ground_truth": [
    "JnJ sold its inventory 2.7 times in FY2022."

  "correctness_reasoning": "The predicted answer does not provide the correct inventory turnover ratio, which is 2.7 according to the ground truth. The explanation about why conventional inventory management may not be meaningful for J&J is not relevant to the question, which specifically asks for the inventory turnover ratio. The predicted answer fails to provide the numerical answer within the acceptable tolerance range."
