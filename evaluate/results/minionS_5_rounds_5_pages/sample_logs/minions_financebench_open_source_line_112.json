  "correctness_reasoning": "The predicted answer does not match the ground truth answer. The ground truth clearly states that Microsoft's debt decreased by $2.5bn, which is a definitive answer. The predicted answer claims that the information is insufficient to determine the change in debt, which contradicts the ground truth. Therefore, the stance does not match exactly as required for yes/no questions."
