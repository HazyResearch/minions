--- Question ---
Does AMD have a reasonably healthy liquidity profile based on its quick ratio for FY22? If the quick ratio is not relevant to measure liquidity, please state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
AMD has a reasonably healthy liquidity profile based on its quick ratio for FY22, which is approximately 1.90.

--- Ground Truth ---
['Yes. The quick ratio is 1.57, calculated as (cash and cash equivalents+Short term investments+Accounts receivable, net+receivables from related parties)/ (current liabilities).']

--- Correctness Evaluation ---
Is correct: False
Confidence: 0.80
Reasoning: The predicted quick ratio of 1.90 is outside the 10% tolerance range of the ground truth quick ratio of 1.57 (acceptable range: 1.413 to 1.727). Therefore, the numerical aspect of the predicted answer is incorrect, even though the overall conclusion about AMD's liquidity profile being reasonably healthy matches the ground truth.
