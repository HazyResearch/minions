      "output": "To answer the question about Walmart's FY2018 - FY2020 3-year average unadjusted EBITDA % margin, you need to focus on specific financial data from the company's financial statements. First, identify the unadjusted operating income and the depreciation and amortization figures from the cash flow statements for each fiscal year from 2018 to 2020. These figures are essential to calculate the unadjusted EBITDA for each year. Next, locate the total revenue from the profit and loss (P&L) statement for the same fiscal years. The unadjusted EBITDA % margin is calculated by dividing the unadjusted EBITDA by the total revenue and then multiplying by 100 to convert it to a percentage. Once you have the EBITDA % margin for each year, compute the average of these three percentages to get the 3-year average. Ensure all calculations are rounded to one decimal place as required."

Instead, you can assign small, isolated tasks to a less capable worker model that sees only a single chunk of text at a time. Any cross-chunk or multi-document reasoning must be handled by you.\n\n## Your Job: Write Two Python Functions\n\n### FUNCTION #1: `prepare_jobs(context, prev_job_manifests, prev_job_outputs) -> List[JobManifest]`\n- Break the document(s) into chunks (using the provided chunking function, if needed). Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 12 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`. All **multi-chunk integration** or **global reasoning** is your responsibility here.\n- Return one **aggregated string** suitable for further supervisor inspection.\n\n\n\n## Relevant Pydantic Models\n\nThe following models are already in the global scope. **Do NOT redefine or re-import them.**\n\n### JobManifest Model\n```\nclass JobManifest(BaseModel):\n    chunk: str  # the actual text for the chunk of the document\n    task: str  # the actual task instruction for the small model\n    advice: str  # optional, any additional advice on how to perform the task\n\n    chunk_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    task_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    job_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n\n```\n\n### JobOutput Model\n```\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    citation: Optional[str]\n    answer: Optional[str]\n\n```\n\n## Function Signatures\n```\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        context (List[str]): A list of documents.

Walton opened a\nfranchise Ben Franklin variety store in Newport, Arkansas. In 1946, his brother, James L. Walton, opened a similar store in Versailles, Missouri. Until 1962, our\nfounders' business was devoted entirely to the operation of variety stores. In that year, the first Wal-Mart Discount City, which was a discount store, opened in\nRogers, Arkansas. In 1983, we opened our first Sam's Club, and in 1988, we opened our first supercenter. In 1998, we opened our first Walmart Neighborhood\nMarket. In 1991, we began our first international initiative when we entered into a joint venture in Mexico. Since then, our international presence has expanded\nand, as of January 31, 2020, our Walmart International segment conducted business in 26 countries.\nIn 2000, we began our first eCommerce initiative by creating walmart.com and then later that year, adding samsclub.com. Since then, our eCommerce presence has\ncontinued to grow. In 2007, leveraging our physical stores, walmart.com launched its Site to Store service, enabling customers to make a purchase online and pick\nup merchandise in stores. Since 2016, we have made several eCommerce acquisitions which have enabled us to leverage technology, talent and expertise, as well\nas incubate digitally-native brands and expand our assortment on walmart.com and in stores. In fiscal 2017, walmart.com launched free two-day shipping and we\ncreated Store No 8, a technology incubator with a focus to drive eCommerce innovation. Then in fiscal 2019, we continued to enhance our eCommerce initiatives\nwith the acquisition of a majority stake of Flipkart Private Limited (\"Flipkart\"), an Indian-based eCommerce marketplace, with an ecosystem that includes\neCommerce platforms of Flipkart and Myntra as well as PhonePe, a digital transaction platform.\nIn fiscal 2020, we launched NextDay Delivery to more than 75 percent of the U.S. population, launched Delivery Unlimited from 1,600 locations in the U.S. and\nexpanded Same Day Pickup to nearly 3,200 locations. Our eCommerce efforts and innovation have also led to omni-channel offerings in many of our markets\nincluding grocery pick up and/or delivery in nearly a dozen countries outside the U.S. To date, we now have more than 6,100 grocery pick up and delivery\nlocations globally. We are enhancing our ecosystem with our omni-channel capabilities, stores, services, eCommerce sites, supply chain combined with our more\nthan 2.2 million associates to better serve our customers. Together, we believe these elements produce a flywheel effect which creates customer relationships where\ncustomers view Walmart as their primary destination.\n7\n\n\nInformation About Our Segments\nWe are engaged in global operations of retail, wholesale and other units, as well as eCommerce, located throughout the U.S., Africa, Argentina, Canada, Central\nAmerica, Chile",

Our operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart\nInternational and Sam's Club. We define our segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\") regularly reviews to\nanalyze performance and allocate resources. Each of our segments contributes to the Company's operating results differently. Each, however, has generally\nmaintained a consistent contribution rate to the Company's net sales and operating income in recent years other than minor changes to the contribution rate for the\nWalmart International segment due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We sell similar individual products and services in each of our segments. It is\nimpracticable to segregate and identify revenues for each of these individual products and services.\nWe measure the results of our segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain corporate overhead\nallocations. From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations, as determined by the\ninformation regularly reviewed by our CODM. When the measurement of a segment changes, previous period amounts and balances are reclassified to be\ncomparable to the current period's presentation.\nWalmart U.S. Segment\nWalmart U.S. is our largest segment and operates in the U.S., including in all 50 states, Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico. Walmart U.S. is a mass merchandiser of\nconsumer products, operating under the \"Walmart\" and \"Walmart Neighborhood Market\" brands, as well as walmart.com and other eCommerce brands. Walmart\nU.S. had net sales of $341.0 billion for fiscal 2020, representing 66% of our fiscal 2020 consolidated net sales, and had net sales of $331.7 billion and $318.5\nbillion for fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. Of our three segments, Walmart U.S. has historically had the highest gross profit as a percentage of net sales (\"gross\nprofit rate\"). In addition, Walmart U.S. has historically contributed the greatest amount to the Company's net sales and operating income.\nOmni-channel. Walmart U.S. provides an omni-channel experience to customers, integrating retail stores and eCommerce, through services such as \"Same Day\nPickup,\" \"Same Day Delivery,\" \"Delivery Unlimited,\" \"NextDay Delivery,\" and \"Endless Aisle.\" As of January 31, 2020, we had nearly 3,200 grocery pickup\nlocations and over 1,600 delivery locations.

Walmart U.S. competes with omni-channel retailers operating discount, department, retail and wholesale grocers, drug, dollar, variety and specialty\nstores, supermarkets, hypermarkets and supercenter-type stores, as well as eCommerce retailers. Our ability to develop and operate units at the right locations and\nto deliver a customer-centric omni-channel experience largely determines our competitive position within the retail industry. We employ many programs designed\nto meet competitive pressures within our industry. These programs include the following:\n•\nEDLP: our pricing philosophy under which we price items at everyday low prices so our customers trust that our prices will not change under frequent\npromotional activity;\n•\nEDLC: everyday low cost is our commitment to control expenses so our cost savings can be passed along to our customers; and\n•\nOmni-channel offerings such as Same Day Pickup and Same Day Delivery, where a customer places an order online and picks it up for free from a store\nor has it delivered; Delivery Unlimited, where a customer can receive unlimited grocery delivery for an annual fee; as well as free two-day shipping\nwithout an annual membership fee and free NextDay Delivery on an assortment of best-selling items.\nDistribution. For fiscal 2020, approximately 79% of Walmart U.S.'s purchases of store merchandise were shipped through our 162 distribution facilities, which are\nlocated strategically throughout the U.S. The remaining store merchandise we purchased was shipped directly from suppliers. General merchandise and dry grocery\nmerchandise is transported primarily through the segment's private truck fleet; however, we contract with common carriers to transport the majority of our\nperishable grocery merchandise. We ship merchandise purchased by customers on our eCommerce platforms by a number of methods from multiple locations\nincluding from our 40 dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers which includes eight temporary fulfillment centers.\nWalmart International Segment\nWalmart International is our second largest segment and operates in 26 countries outside of the U.S. Walmart International operates through our wholly-owned\nsubsidiaries in Argentina, Canada, Chile, China, India, Japan and the United Kingdom, and our majority-owned subsidiaries in Africa (which includes Botswana,\nGhana, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia), Central America (which includes\nCosta Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua), India and Mexico.

These categories consist of many formats,\nincluding: supercenters, supermarkets, hypermarkets, warehouse clubs (including Sam's Clubs) and cash & carry, as well as eCommerce through walmart.com.mx,\nasda.com, walmart.ca, flipkart.com and other sites. Walmart International had net sales of $120.1 billion for fiscal 2020, representing 23% of our fiscal 2020\nconsolidated net sales, and had net sales of $120.8 billion and $118.1 billion for fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. The segment's net sales were negatively\nimpacted by currency exchange rate fluctuations for all years presented. The gross profit rate is lower than that of Walmart U.S. primarily because of its\nmerchandise mix.\n9\n\n\nWalmart International's strategy is to create strong local businesses powered by Walmart which means being locally relevant and customer-focused in each of the\nmarkets it operates. We are being deliberate about where and how we choose to operate and continue to re-shape the portfolio to best enable long-term, sustainable\nand profitable growth. As such, we have taken certain strategic actions to strengthen our Walmart International portfolio for the long-term, including:\n•\nAcquisition of a majority stake of Flipkart in August 2018.\n•\nDivestiture of 80 percent of Walmart Brazil to Advent International (“Advent”) in August 2018. \n•\nDivestiture of the Walmart Chile banking operations in December 2018 and the divestiture of the Walmart Canada banking operations in April 2019.\nOmni-channel. Walmart International provides an omni-channel experience to customers, integrating retail stores and eCommerce, such as through services like\n\"Click & Collect\" in the United Kingdom, our grocery pick-up and delivery business in several other markets, our marketplaces, such as Flipkart in India, and a\ndigital transaction platform anchored in payments such as PhonePe in India.\nGenerally, retail units' selling area range in size from 1,400 square feet to 186,000 square feet. Our wholesale stores' selling area generally range in size from\n25,000 square feet to 156,000 square feet.

We also discuss certain performance metrics that management uses to assess the Company's\nperformance. Additionally, the discussion provides information about the financial results of each of the three segments to provide a better understanding of how\neach of those segments and its results of operations affect the financial condition and results of operations of the Company as a whole.\nThroughout this Item 7, we discuss segment operating income, comparable store and club sales and other measures.

Management measures the results of the\nCompany's segments using each segment's operating income, including certain corporate overhead allocations, as well as other measures. From time to time, we\nrevise the measurement of each segment's operating income and other measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating\ndecision maker.\nManagement also measures the results of comparable store and club sales, or comparable sales, a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and\nclubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period from the corresponding period in the previous\nyear. Walmart's definition of comparable sales includes sales from stores and clubs open for the previous 12 months, including remodels, relocations, expansions\nand conversions, as well as eCommerce sales. We measure the eCommerce sales impact by including all sales initiated online or through mobile applications,\nincluding omni-channel transactions which are fulfilled through our stores and clubs. Sales at a store that has changed in format are excluded from comparable\nsales when the conversion of that store is accompanied by a relocation or expansion that results in a change in the store's retail square feet of more than five\npercent. Additionally, sales related to acquisitions are excluded until such acquisitions have been owned for 12 months. Comparable sales are also referred to as\n\"same-store\" sales by others within the retail industry. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our calculation of\ncomparable sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nBeginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we updated our definition of what was previously referred to as traffic (a component, along with ticket, of\ncomparable sales). Traffic is now referred to as \"transactions\" and measures a percentage change in the number of sales transactions in our comparable stores, as\nwell as for comparable eCommerce activity.\nIn discussing our operating results, the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for countries\nwhere the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars or for countries experiencing hyperinflation. We calculate the effect of changes in currency\nexchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period’s currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year\nperiod’s currency exchange rates. Additionally, no currency exchange rate fluctuations are calculated for non-USD acquisitions until owned for 12 months.\nThroughout our discussion, we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. Volatility in currency exchange rates\nmay impact the results, including net sales and operating income,",

These improvements were partially offset by\n$0.9 billion in business restructuring charges consisting primarily of non-cash impairment charges for certain trade names, acquired developed technology, and\nother business restructuring charges due to strategic decisions that resulted in the write down of certain assets in the Walmart U.S. and Walmart International\nsegments.\nFor fiscal 2019, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 48 basis points, when compared to the previous fiscal year. The primary drivers of the\nexpense leverage were strong sales performance in conjunction with productivity improvements and lapping of certain fiscal 2018 charges.

We measure return on capital with our return on assets, return on\ninvestment and free cash flow metrics. We also provide returns in the form of share repurchases and dividends, which are discussed in the Liquidity and Capital\nResources section.\nReturn on Assets and Return on Investment\nWe include Return on Assets (\"ROA\"), the most directly comparable measure based on our financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles in the U.S. (\"GAAP\"), and Return on Investment (\"ROI\") as metrics to assess returns on assets. While ROI is considered a non-GAAP\nfinancial measure, management believes ROI is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively Walmart is deploying\nits assets. Trends in ROI can fluctuate over time as management balances long-term strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts. ROA was 6.7% and 3.4%\nfor fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in ROA was primarily due to the increase in consolidated net income primarily due to the change in fair value\nof the investment in JD.com and lapping the $4.5 billion net loss recorded in fiscal 2019 related to the sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil, partially offset\nby the dilution to operating income related to Flipkart. ROI was 13.4% and 14.2% for fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease in ROI was due to the\ndecrease in operating income primarily as a result of the dilution from Flipkart as well as business restructuring charges recorded in fiscal 2020. The denominator\nremained relatively flat as the increase in average total assets due to the acquisition of Flipkart was offset by the decrease in average invested capital resulting from\nthe removal of the eight times rent factor upon adoption of ASU 2016-02, Leases (\"ASU 2016-02\") since operating lease right of use assets are now included in\ntotal assets.\n32\n\n\nWe define ROI as operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense for the trailing 12 months divided by average invested\ncapital during that period. We consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus average accumulated depreciation\nand average amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-02, rent for the trailing 12\nmonths multiplied by a factor of 8 is no longer included in the calculation of ROI on a prospective basis as operating lease assets are now capitalized.

A two-point average will be used for leased assets beginning in fiscal 2021, after one full year from the date of adoption of the new lease standard.\nFurther, beginning prospectively in fiscal 2020, rent expense in the numerator excludes short-term and variable lease costs as these costs are not included in the\noperating lease right of use asset balance.\nPrior to adoption of ASU 2016-02, we defined ROI as operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense for the trailing 12\nmonths divided by average invested capital during that period. We considered average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets,\nplus average accumulated depreciation and average amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period, plus a rent factor\nequal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing 12 months multiplied by a factor of 8, which estimated the hypothetical capitalization of our operating leases.\nBecause the new lease standard was adopted under the modified retrospective approach as of February 1, 2019, our calculation of ROI for fiscal 2019 was not\nrevised.\nOur calculation of ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROI using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are\nincluded and excluded in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. For example, we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our\nreported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of ROI. As mentioned above, we consider ROA to be the financial measure computed in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles most directly comparable to our calculation of ROI. ROI differs from ROA (which is consolidated net\nincome for the period divided by average total assets for the period) because ROI: adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest\nincome; and adjusts total assets for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization, accounts payable and accrued liabilities to arrive at total invested\ncapital. Because of the adjustments mentioned above, we believe ROI more accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to\ninvestors than ROA. Although ROI is a standard financial measure, numerous methods exist for calculating a company's ROI. As a result, the method used by\nmanagement to calculate our ROI may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their ROI.\nThe calculation of ROA and ROI, along with a reconciliation of ROI to the calculation of ROA, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, is as follows:\n \nFiscal Years Ended January 31,\n(Amounts in millions)\n2020\n2019\nCALCULATION OF RETURN ON ASSETS\nNumerator\n",

Management believes, however, that free cash flow, which measures our ability to generate additional\ncash from our business operations, is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the Company's financial performance. Free cash flow should be\nconsidered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a\nmeasure of our liquidity. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for discussions of GAAP metrics including net cash provided by operating activities, net cash used in\ninvesting activities and net cash used in financing activities.\nWe define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period. We had net cash\nprovided by operating activities of $25.3 billion, $27.8 billion and $28.3 billion for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We generated free cash flow of $14.6\nbillion, $17.4 billion and $18.3 billion for fiscal 2020, 2019 an",

Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2020 declined when\ncompared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to the contribution to our Asda pension plan in anticipation of its future settlement, the inclusion of a full year of Flipkart\noperations, and the timing of vendor payments. Free cash flow for fiscal 2020 declined when compared to fiscal 2019 due to the same reasons as the decline in net\ncash provided by operating activities, as well as $0.4 billion in increased capital expenditures. Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2019 declined\nwhen compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to timing of vendor payments, partially offset by lower tax payments mainly resulting from the Tax Act and the\ntiming of tax payments. Free cash flow for fiscal 2019 declined when compared to fiscal 2018 due to the same reasons as the decline in net cash provided by\noperating activities, as well as $0.3 billion in increased capital expenditures.\nWalmart's definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the\nmeasure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, we\nbelieve it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nAlthough other companies report their free cash flow, numerous methods may exist for calculating a company's free cash flow. As a result, the method used by\nmanagement to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net cash provided by operating activities, which we believe to\nbe the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow, as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used\nin financing activities.\n \nFiscal Years Ended January 31,\n(Amounts in millions)\n2020\n2019\n2018\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n25,255\n$\n27,753\n$\n28,337\nPayments for property and equipment\n(10,705)\n(10,344)\n(10,051)\nFree cash flow\n$\n14,550\n$\n17,409\n$\n18,286\nNet cash used in investing activities(1)\n$\n(9,128)\n$\n(24,036)\n$\n(9,079)\nNet cash used in financing activities\n(14,299)\n(2,537)\n(19,875)\n(1) \"Net cash used in investing activities\" includes payments for property and equipment, which is also included in our computation of free cash flow.\n34\n\n\nResults of Operations\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nFiscal Years Ended January 31,\n(Amounts in millions, except unit counts)\n2020\n2019\n2018\nTotal revenues\n$\n523,964\n$\n514,405\n$\n500,343\nPercentage change from comparable period\n1.9%\n2.8%\n3.0%\nNet sales\n$\n519,926\n$\n510,329\n$\n495,761\nPercentage change from comparable period\n1.9%\n2.9%\n3.0%\nTotal U.S. calen",

These increases in revenues were due to increases in net sales, which increased $9.6 billion or 1.9% and\n$14.6 billion or 2.9% for fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.

These increases were partially offset by $4.1 billion of negative impact from\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates in fiscal 2020 and our sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil in August 2018. For fiscal 2019, net sales were\npositively impacted by overall positive comparable sales for Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments, along with positive comparable sales in the majority of our\nInternational markets and net sales from Flipkart, which we acquired in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. Additionally, for fiscal 2019, the increase in net sales was\npartially offset by a $4.5 billion decrease in net sales due to club closures in the Sam's Club segment during fiscal 2018, a $3.1 billion reduction in net sales due to\nthe sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil in the International segment, and $0.7 billion of negative impact from fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\nOur gross profit rate decreased 40 and 18 basis points for fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2020, these\ndecreases were primarily due to price investment in the Walmart U.S. segment and the addition of Flipkart in the Walmart International segment, partially offset by\nfavorable merchandise mix including strength in private brands and less pressure from transportation costs in the Walmart U.S. segment. For fiscal 2019, the\ndecrease was due to the mix effects from our growing eCommerce business, the acquisition of Flipkart, our planned pricing strategy and increased transportation\nexpenses.\nFor fiscal 2020, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 8 basis points, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year due to our\nfocus on expense management combined with our gro",

The primary drivers of the\nexpense leverage were strong sales performance in conjunction with productivity improvements and lapping approximately $1.8 billion in certain charges in fiscal\n2018. The improvements in fiscal 2019 were partially offset by additional investments in eCommerce and technology, as well as a $0.2 billion charge related to a\nsecurities class action lawsuit.\nOther gains and losses consisted of a gain of $2.0 billion for fiscal 2020 and a loss of $8.4 billion for fiscal 2019. The gain in fiscal 2020 was primarily the result of\na $1.9 billion increase in the market value of our investment in JD.com. The loss in fiscal 2019 is primarily the result of the $4.8 billion pre-tax loss on the sale of\nthe majority stake in Walmart Brazil and a $3.5 billion decrease in the market value of our investment in JD.com.

The decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 is\nprimarily due to the fiscal 2019 loss on sale of a majority stake in Walmart Brazil, which increased the comparative period's effective tax rate, as it provided\nminimal realizable tax benefit. The increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 is primarily due to the aforementioned loss on sale of a majority stake in\nWalmart Brazil and Flipkart's results. Additionally, our effective income tax rate may also fluctuate as a result of various factors, including changes in our\nassessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix and\nsize of earnings among our U.S. operations and international operations, which are subject to statutory rates that, beginning in fiscal 2019, are generally higher than\nthe U.S. statutory rate.

The decrease in net cash provided by operating\nactivities for fiscal 2019, when compared to the previous fiscal year, was primarily due to timing of vendor payments, partially offset by lower tax payments\nmainly resulting from Tax Reform and the timing of tax payments.\nCash Equivalents and Working Capital Deficit\nCash and cash equivalents were $9.5 billion and $7.7 billion as of January 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

          "chunk": "terminology. In preparing the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, we follow accounting principles generally accepted in the\nU.S. These principles require us to make certain estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations as reflected in our\nfinancial statements. These judgments and estimates are based on past events and expectations of future outcomes. Actual results may differ from our estimates.\nManagement continually reviews our accounting policies, how they are applied and how they are reported and disclosed in our financial statements. Following is a\nsummary of our critical accounting estimates and how they are applied in preparation of the financial statements.\nInventories\nWe value inventories at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, using the last-in, first-out (\"LIFO\")\nmethod for Walmart U.S. segment's inventories. The inventory at the Sam's Club segment is valued using the weighted-average cost LIFO method. When\nnecessary, we record a LIFO provision for the estimated annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end. Our\nLIFO provision is calculated based on inventory levels, markup rates and internally generated retail price indices. As a measure of sensitivity, a 1% increase to our\nretail price indices would not have resulted in a decrease to the carrying value of inventory. As of January 31, 2020 and 2019, our inventories valued at LIFO\napproximated those inventories as if they were valued at FIFO.\nImpairment of Assets\nWe evaluate long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable.\nManagement's judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and financial performance. The evaluation of long-lived\nassets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally at the individual store level. The variability of these factors depends on a\nnumber of conditions, including uncertainty about future events and changes in demographics. Thus, our accounting estimates may change from period to period.\nThese factors could cause management to conclude that indicators of impairment exist and require impairment tests be performed, which could result in\nmanagement determining the value of long-lived assets is impaired, resulting in a write-down of the related long-lived assets. Impairment charges recorded in fiscal\n2020 were\n42\n\n\nimmaterial. As a measure of sensitivity, fiscal 2020 impairment would not change materially with a 10% decrease in the undiscounted cash flows for the stores or\nclubs with indicators of impairment. While fiscal 2019 included a pre-tax loss of $4.8 billion related to the sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil, which\nincluded full impairment of all related-assets, there were no other material impairment ",

          "chunk": "material impairment charges for fiscal 2019.\nBusiness Combinations, Goodwill, and Acquired Intangible Assets\nWe account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control is obtained, all the assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed, including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, are recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. The\ndetermination of fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities requires estimates and the use of valuation techniques when market value is not readily available.\nFor intangible assets acquired in a business combination, we typically use the income method. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but\nare not limited to, the amount and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, discount rates and useful lives. The excess of the purchase price over fair values of\nidentifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.\nGoodwill is assigned to the reporting unit which consolidates the acquisition. Components within the same reportable segment are aggregated and deemed a single\nreporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics. As of January 31, 2020, our reporting units consisted of Walmart U.S., Walmart\nInternational and Sam's Club. Goodwill and other indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets are not amortized, but are evaluated for impairment annually or\nwhenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of a certain asset may be impaired. Generally, this evaluation begins with a qualitative\nassessment to determine whether a quantitative impairment test is necessary. If we determine, after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factors, that\nthe fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, or that a fair value of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the\ncarrying amount cannot be assured, then a quantitative impairment test would be performed. The quantitative test for impairment requires management to make\njudgments relating to future cash flows, growth rates and economic and market conditions. These evaluations are based on determining the fair value of a reporting\nunit or asset using a valuation method such as discounted cash flow or a relative, market-based approach. Historically, our reporting units have generated sufficient\nreturns to recover the cost of goodwill, as the fair value significantly exceeded the carrying value. Our indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets have also\nhistorically generated sufficient returns to recover their cost; however, due to certain strategic restructuring decisions in fiscal 2020, we recorded approximately\n$0.7 billion in impairment related to acquired trade names and acquired developed software. Because of the nature of the factors used in these tests, if different\nconditions occur in future periods, future operating results could be materially impacted.\nC",

We record a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable.\nWe also perform an assessment of the materiality of loss contingencies where a loss is either not probable or it is reasonably possible that a loss could be incurred\nin excess of amounts accrued. If a loss or an additional loss has at least a reasonable possibility of occurring and the impact on the financial statements would be\nmaterial, we provide disclosure of the loss contingency in the footnotes to our financial statements. We review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine\nwhether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or the range of the loss can be made. Although we are not able to\npredict the outcome or reasonably estimate a range of possible losses in certain matters described in Note 10 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements,\nand have not recorded an associated accrual related to these matters, an adverse judgment or negotiated resolution in any of these matters could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes have a significant effect on our net earnings. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Accordingly, the\ndetermination of our provision for income taxes requires judgment, the use of estimates in certain cases and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws.\nOur effective income tax rate is affected by many factors, including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, increases and decreases in valuation\nallowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and international\noperations where the statutory rates are generally higher than the U.S. statutory rate, and may fluctuate as a result.\nOur tax returns are routinely audited and settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our tax provisions. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are\nrecorded in our financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from\ntaxing authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate. We\naccount for uncertain tax positions by determining the minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the\nfinancial statements. This determination requires the use of judgment in evaluating our tax positions and assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and\ntaxable items.\nDeferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. Such assets arise because of",

Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that a portion\nis not more likely than not to be realized. Many factors are considered when assessing whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized,\nincluding recent cumulative earnings, expectations of future taxable income, carryforward periods and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. The\nrecoverability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable\ntemporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. This evaluation relies on estimates.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"Tax Act\") was enacted and contains significant changes to U.S. income tax law. Effective\nbeginning January 2018, the Tax Act reduced the U.S. statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% and created new taxes on foreign-sourced earnings and related-party\npayments. As discussed in Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, we completed our accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act in fiscal 2019. As\nfurther guidance is issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard–setting bodies, any resulting changes to our estimates will be treated in\naccordance with the relevant accounting guidance.\nITEM 7A.\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nMarket Risk\nIn addition to the risks inherent in our operations, we are exposed to certain market risks, including changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and the fair\nvalue of our equity investment in JD.com.\nThe analysis presented below for each of our market risk sensitive instruments is based on a hypothetical scenario used to calibrate potential risk and does not\nrepresent our view of future market changes. The effect of a change in a particular assumption is calculated without adjusting any other assumption. In reality,\nhowever, a change in one factor could cause a change in another, which may magnify or negate other sensitivities.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our short-term borrowings and long-term debt. We hedge a portion of our interest rate risk by managing\nthe mix of fixed and variable rate debt and by entering into interest rate swaps. For fiscal 2020, the net fair value of our interest rate swaps increased $175 million\nprimarily due to fluctuations in market interest rates.\nThe table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For long-term debt, the table represents the\nprincipal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. For inter",

Based on January 31, 2020 debt levels, a 100 basis point change in prevailing market rates would cause our annual interest costs to change by\napproximately $61 million.\n44\n\n\nForeign Currency Risk\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates as a result of our net investments and operations in countries other than the U.S, as well our foreign-\ncurrency-denominated long-term debt. For fiscal 2020, movements in currency exchange rates and the related impact on the translation of the balance sheets of the\nCompany's subsidiaries in the UK and Mexico were the primary cause of the $0.3 billion gain in the currency translation and other category of accumulated other\ncomprehensive loss.\nWe hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk by entering into currency swaps. The aggregate fair value of these swaps was in a liability position of $241 million\nand asset position of $62 million as of January 31, 2020 and January 31, 2019, respectively. The change in the fair value of these swaps was due to fluctuations in\ncurrency exchange rates, primarily the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies in fiscal 2020. The hypothetical result of a uniform 10%\nweakening in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies underlying these swaps would have resulted in a change in the value of the swaps of $173\nmillion. A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates underlying these swaps from the market rates in effect as of January 31, 2020 would have resulted in a change\nin the value of the swaps of $42 million.\nIn addition to currency swaps, ",

Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to\nassess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such\nprocedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.

For other matters, a liability is not probable, or the amount\ncannot be reasonably estimated and therefore an accrual has not been made. Where a liability is reasonably possible and may be\nmaterial, such matters have been disclosed. Management assessed the probability of occurrence and the estimation of any potential\nloss based on the ability to predict the number of claims that may be filed or whether any loss or range of loss can be reasonably\nestimated. For example, in assessing the probability of occurrence in a particular legal proceeding, management exercises judgment to\ndetermine if it can predict the number of claims that may be filed and whether it can reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that\nmay arise from that proceeding.\n47\n\n\nAuditing management’s accounting for, and disclosure of, loss contingencies was complex and highly judgmental as it involved our\nassessment of the significant judgments made by management when assessing the probability of occurrence or when determining\nwhether an estimate of the loss or range of loss could be made.\nHow We Addressed\nthe Matter in Our\nAudit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the identification and\nevaluation of contingencies. For example, we tested controls over the Company’s assessment of the likelihood of loss and the\nCompany’s determinations regarding the measurement of loss.\nTo test the Company’s assessment of the probability of occurrence or determination of an estimate of loss, or range of loss, among\nother procedures, we read the minutes of the meetings of the board of directors and committees of the board of directors, reviewed\nopinions provided to the Company by certain outside legal counsel, read letters received directly by us from internal and external\ncounsel, and evaluated the current status of contingencies based on discussions with internal legal counsel.

As disclosed in Notes 1, 8 and 12 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements, these assets are evaluated for impairment at least annually using valuation techniques to estimate\nfair value. These fair value estimates are sensitive to certain significant assumptions including revenue growth rates, discount rates,\nand royalty rates.\nAuditing management’s annual indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment tests was complex and highly judgmental due to the\nsignificant measurement uncertainty in determining the fair values of the indefinite-lived intangibles.

A company’s internal control over financial\nreporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of\nfinancial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of\nunauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with\nthe policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nRogers, Arkansas\nMarch 20, 2020\n49\n\n\nWalmart Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Income\nFiscal Years Ended January 31,\n(Amounts in millions, except per share data)\n2020\n2019\n2018\nRevenues:\nNet sales\n$\n519,926\n$\n510,329\n$\n495,761\nMembership and other income\n4,038\n4,076\n4,582\nTotal revenues\n523,964\n514,405\n500,343\nCosts and expenses:\nCost of sales\n394,605\n385,301\n373,396\nOperating, selling, general and administrative expenses\n108,791\n107,14",

Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The\nCompany consolidates variable interest entities where it has been determined that the Company is the primary beneficiary of those entities' operations. Investments\nfor which the Company exercises significant influence but does not have control are accounted for under the equity method. These variable interest entities and\nequity method investments are immaterial to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are based on a fiscal year ending on January 31 for the United States (\"U.S.\") and Canadian operations. The\nCompany consolidates all other operations generally using a one-month lag and based on a calendar year. There were no significant intervening events during the\nmonth of January 2020 related to the operations consolidated using a lag that materially affected the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nUse of Estimates\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Those principles require management\nto make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. Management's estimates and assumptions also affect the disclosure of\ncontingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results\nmay differ from those estimates.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers investments with a maturity when purchased of three months or less to be cash equivalents. All credit card, debit card and electronic\ntransfer transactions that process in less than seven days are classified as cash and cash equivalents. The amounts due from banks for these transactions classified as\ncash and cash equivalents totaled $1.7 billion and $1.4 billion as of January 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe Company's cash balances are held in various locations around the world. Most of the Company's $9.5 billion and $7.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents as of\nJanuary 31, 2020 and January 31, 2019 were held outside of the U.S. Cash and cash equivalents held outside of the U.S. are generally utilized to support liquidity\nneeds in the Company's non-U.S. operations.\nThe Company uses intercompany financing arrangements in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is needed with the minimum\ncost possible.\nAs of January 31, 2020 and 2019, cash and cash equivalents of approximately $2.3 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively, may not be freely transferable to the U.S.\ndue to local laws o",

Of the $2.3 billion as of January 31, 2020, approximately $0.6 billion can only be accessed through dividends or\nintercompany financing arrangements subject to approval of Flipkart Private Limited (\"Flipkart\") minority shareholders; however, this cash is expected to be\nutilized to fund the operations of Flipkart.\nReceivables\nReceivables are stated at their carrying values, net of a reserve for doubtful accounts, and are primarily due from the following: customers, which also includes\ninsurance companies resulting from pharmacy sales, banks for customer credit, debit cards and electronic transfer transactions that take in excess of seven days to\nprocess; suppliers for marketing or incentive programs; governments for income taxes; and real estate transactions. As of January 31, 2020 and January 31, 2019,\nreceivables from transactions with customers, net were $2.9 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively.\n55\n\n\nInventories\nThe Company values inventories at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, using the last-in, first-out\n(\"LIFO\") method for the Walmart U.S. segment's inventories. The inventory for the Walmart International segment is valued primarily by the retail inventory\nmethod of accounting, using the first-in, first-out (\"FIFO\") method. The retail inventory method of accounting results in inventory being valued at the lower of cost\nor market, since permanent markdowns are immediately recorded as a reduction of the retail value of inventory. The inventory at the Sam's Club segment is valued\nusing the weighted-average cost LIFO method. As of January 31, 2020 and January 31, 2019, the Company's inventories valued at LIFO approximated those\ninventories as if they were valued at FIFO.\nAssets Held for Sale\nAssets held for sale represent components and businesses that meet accounting requirements to be classified as held for sale and are presented as single asset and\nliability amounts in the Company's financial statements with a valuation allowance, if necessary, to recognize the net carrying amount at the lower of cost or fair\nvalue, less costs to sell.  The Company reviews all businesses and assets held for sale each reporting period to determine whether the existing carrying amounts are\nfully recoverable in comparison to estimated fair values.  As of January 31, 2020 and January 31, 2019, immaterial amounts for assets and liabilities held for sale\nwere classified in prepaid expenses and other and accrued liabilities, respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are initially recorded at cost. Gains or losses on disposition are recognized as earned or incurred. Costs of major improvements are\ncapitalized, while costs of normal repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. The following table summarizes the Company's property and equipment\nbalances and includes the estimated useful lives that are g",

Total\ndepreciation and amortization expense for property and equipment, property under finance leases and financing obligations, property under capital leases and\nintangible assets for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $11.0 billion, $10.7 billion and $10.5 billion, respectively.\nLeases\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which requires lease assets and liabilities to be recorded on the balance sheet.  The\nCompany adopted this ASU and related amendments as of February 1, 2019 under the modified retrospective approach and elected certain practical expedients\npermitted under the transition guidance, including to retain the historical lease classification as well as relief from reviewing expired or existing contracts to\ndetermine if they contain leases.  For leases subject to index or rate adjustments, the most current index or rate adjustments were included in the measurement of\noperating lease obligations at adoption.\nThe adoption of this ASU and related amendments resulted in a $14.8 billion increase to total assets and a $15.1 billion increase to total liabilities in the first\nquarter of fiscal 2020. In the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company recognized $16.8 billion and $17.5 billion of operating lease right-of-use assets and\noperating lease obligations, respectively, and removed $2.2 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively, of assets and liabilities related to financial obligations connected\nwith the construction of leased stores. Several other asset and liability line items in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet were also impacted by immaterial\namounts. Additionally, the adoption resulted in a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings of approximately $0.3 billion, net of tax, which primarily\nconsisted of the recognition of impairment. The Company’s Consolidated Statement of Income and Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows were immaterially\nimpacted. Accounting policies as a result of the adoption of this ASU are described below.  Refer to Note 7 for additional lease disclosures.\nFor any new or modified lease, the Company, at the inception of the contract, determines whether a contract is or contains a lease.

As the rate implicit in the Company's leases is not easily\ndeterminable, the Company’s applicable incremental borrowing rate is used in calculating the present value of the sum of the lease payments.\nLease term is defined as the non-cancelable period of the lease plus any options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will\nexercise the option. The Company has elected not to recognize ROU asset and lease obligations for its short-term leases, which are defined as leases with an initial\nterm of 12 months or less.\nFor a majority of all classes of underlying assets, the Company has elected to not separate lease from non-lease components. For leases in which the lease and non-\nlease components have been combined, the variable lease expense includes expenses such as common area maintenance, utilities, and repairs and maintenance.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nManagement reviews long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be\nrecoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is at the individual store or club level. Undiscounted cash flows\nexpected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over the assets' useful lives based on updated projections. If the evaluation indicates that the carrying\namount of the assets may not be recoverable, any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related asset or asset group as determined by an\nappropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique.\nGoodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations and is allocated to the appropriate reporting\nunit when acquired. Other acquired intangible assets are stated at the fair value acquired as determined by a valuation technique commensurate with the intended\nuse of the related asset. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized; rather, they are evaluated for impairment annually and whenever events\nor changes in circumstances indicate that the value of the asset may be impaired. Definite-lived intangible assets are considered long-lived assets and are amortized\non a straight-line basis over the periods that expected economic benefits will be provided.\nGoodwill is assigned to the reporting unit which consolidates the acquisition. Components within the same reportable segment are aggregated and deemed a single\nreporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics. As of January 31, 2020, the Company's reporting units consisted of Walmart U.S., Walmart\nInternational and Sam's Club. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment using either a qualitative or quantitative approach for each of the Company's reporting units.\nGenerally, a qua",

If management determines, after\nperforming an assessment based on the qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, or that a fair\nvalue of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured, then a quantitative goodwill impairment test would be required. The\nquantitative test for goodwill impairment is performed by determining the fair value of the related reporting units. Fair value is measured based on the discounted\ncash flow method and relative market-based approaches. After evaluation, management determined the fair value of each reporting unit is significantly greater than\nthe carrying amount and, accordingly, the Company has not recorded any impairment charges related to goodwill.\nThe following table reflects goodwill activity, by reportable segment, for fiscal 2020 and 2019:\n(Amounts in millions)\nWalmart U.S.\nWalmart\nInternational\nSam's Club\nTotal\nBalances as of February 1, 2018\n$\n2,445\n$\n15,484\n$\n313\n$\n18,242\nChanges in currency translation and other\n—\n(743)\n—\n(743)\nAcquisitions (1)\n107\n13,575\n—\n13,682\nBalances as of January 31, 2019\n2,552\n28,316\n313\n31,181\nChanges in currency translation and other\n—\n(149)\n—\n(149)\nAcquisitions\n41\n—\n—\n41\nBalances as of January 31, 2020\n$\n2,593\n$\n28,167\n$\n313\n$\n31,073\n(1) Goodwill recorded in fiscal 2019 for Walmart International relates to Flipkart.\nIntangible assets are included in other long-term assets in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Standard actuarial procedures and data analysis are used to estimate the liabilities associated with these risks as of the balance\nsheet date on an undiscounted basis. The recorded liabilities reflect the ultimate cost for claims incurred but not paid and any estimable administrative run-out\nexpenses related to the processing of these outstanding claim payments. On a regular basis, the liabilities are evaluated for appropriateness with claims reserve\nvaluations. To limit exposure to some risks, the Company maintains insurance coverage with varying limits and retentions, including stop-loss insurance coverage\nfor workers' compensation, general liability and auto liability.\nDerivatives\nThe Company uses derivatives for hedging purposes to manage its exposure to changes in interest and currency exchange rates, as well as to maintain an\nappropriate mix of fixed- and variable-rate debt.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences\nattributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases (\"temporary\ndifferences\"). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be\nrecovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nDeferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that a portion is not more likely than not to be realized.\nMany factors are considered when assessing whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, including recent cumulative earnings,\nexpectations of future taxable income, carryforward periods, and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. The recoverability of the deferred tax assets is\nevaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating\nearnings and available tax planning strategies.

The Company will report the tax impact of GILTI as a period cost when incurred. Accordingly, the Company is not providing deferred taxes for basis\ndifferences expected to reverse as GILTI.\nIn determining the provision for income taxes, an annual effective income tax rate is used based on annual income, permanent differences between book and tax\nincome, and statutory income tax rates.

Beginning January 2018, the Tax Act reduced the U.S. statutory tax\nrate and created new taxes focused on foreign-sourced earnings and related-party payments, including the creation of the base erosion anti-abuse tax and a new tax\non global intangible low-taxed income (\"GILTI\"). In addition, the Company was subject to a one-time transition tax in fiscal 2018 on accumulated foreign\nsubsidiary earnings not previously subject to U.S. income tax.\nThe SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"SAB 118\"), which allowed\ncompanies to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date. Due to the timing of the enactment\nand the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the Tax Act, the Company made reasonable estimates of the effects and recorded provisional amounts in\nits financial statements as of January 31, 2018, in accordance with SAB 118. The Company elected to apply the measurement period provisions of this guidance to\ncertain income tax effects of the Tax Act when it became effective. The provisional measurement period ended in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019.  Management\ncompleted the Company's accounting for Tax Reform in fiscal 2019 based on prevailing regulations and currently available information, and any additional\nguidance issued by the IRS could impact the aforementioned amounts in future periods. The net tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2018 related to the Tax Act was\n$207 million, and in fiscal 2019, the Company recorded $442 million of additional tax expense related to the Tax Act, included as a component of provision for\nincome taxes.\nOne-time Transition Tax\nThe Tax Act required the Company to pay U.S. income taxes on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously subject to U.S. income tax at a rate of\n15.5% to the extent of foreign cash and certain other net current assets, as defined by the Tax Act, and 8.0% on the remaining earnings. In fiscal 2018, the\nCompany recorded a provisional amount of $1.9 billion of additional income tax expense for its one-time transitional tax liability. The Company calculated the\nTransition Tax liability and increased the provisional amount by $413 million, with the increase included as a component of provision for income taxes in fiscal\n2019.\nDeferred Tax Effects\nThe Tax Act reduced the U.S. statutory tax rate fro",

In fiscal 2018, the Company\nrecognized a deferred tax benefit of $2.1 billion to reflect the reduced U.S. tax rate and other effects of the Tax Act.

As a result of the Tax\nAct, the Company reported and paid U.S. tax on the majority of its previously unremitted foreign earnings and repatriations of foreign earnings will generally be\nfree of U.S. federal tax, but may incur other taxes such as withholding or state taxes.  As of January 31, 2020, the Company has not recorded approximately $3\nbillion of deferred tax liabilities associated with remaining unremitted foreign earnings considered indefinitely reinvested, for which U.S. and foreign income and\nwithholding taxes would be due upon repatriation.\nNet Operating Losses, Tax Credit Carryforwards and Valuation Allowances\nAs of January 31, 2020, the Company's net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards totaled approximately $37.8 billion. Of these carryforwards,\napproximately $25.2 billion will expire, if not utilized, in various years through 2040. The remaining carryforwards have no expiration.\nThe recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including\ntaxable income in prior carryback years, reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. To the\nextent the Company does not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is generally established. To the\nextent that a valuation allowance was established and it is subsequently determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be recovered, the\nchange in the valuation allowance is recognized in the consolidated statements of income.\nThe Company had valuation allowances of $8.6 billion and $2.4 billion as of January 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, on deferred tax assets associated primarily\nwith net operating loss carryforwards for which management has determined it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Due to tax\nlaw changes in Luxembourg enacted in December 2019 the Company recognized additional deferred tax assets, and related valuation allowances, of $6.2 billion\nassociated with existing net operating loss carryforwards. Other activity in the valuation allowance during fiscal 2020 related to valuation allowance increases in\nother markets, as well as releases due to the expiration of underlying deferred tax assets.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nThe benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements only after determining a more-likely-than-not probability\nthat the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from taxing authorities.\nAs of January 31, 2",

The claimants allege that the work performed by employees in Asda's retail stores is of equal value in\nterms of, among other things, the demands of their jobs compared to that of employees working in Asda's warehouse and distribution facilities, and that the\ndifference in pay between these job positions disparately impacts women because more women work in retail stores while more men work in warehouses and\ndistribution facilities, and that the pay difference is not objectively justified. The claimants are requesting differential back pay based on higher wage rates in the\nwarehouse and distribution facilities and higher wage rates on a prospective basis.\nIn October 2016, following a preliminary hearing, the Employment Tribunal ruled that claimants could compare their positions in Asda's retail stores with those of\nemployees in Asda's warehouse and distribution facilities.

Under the terms of the sale, Advent agreed to\ncontribute additional capital to the business over a three-year period and Walmart agreed to indemnify Advent for certain matters.\nAs a result, the Company recorded a pre-tax net loss of $4.8 billion during fiscal 2019 in other gains and losses in the Company's Consolidated Statement of\nIncome. Substantially all of this charge was recorded during the second quarter of fiscal 2019 upon meeting the held for sale criteria. In calculating the loss, the fair\nvalue of the disposal group was reduced by $0.8 billion related to an indemnity, for which a liability was recognized upon closing and is recorded in deferred\nincome taxes and other in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Under the indemnity, the Company will indemnify Advent for certain pre-closing tax and\nlegal contingencies and other matters for up to R$2.3 billion, adjusted for interest based on the Brazilian interbank deposit rate.\nThe Company deconsolidated the financial statements of Walmart Brazil during the third quarter of fiscal 2019 and began accounting for its remaining 20 percent\nownership interest using the equity method of accounting. This equity method investment was determined to have no fair value and continues to have no carrying\nvalue.\nFlipkart\nIn August 2018, the Company acquired 81 percent of the outstanding shares, or 77 percent of the diluted shares, of Flipkart, an Indian-based eCommerce\nmarketplace, for cash consideration of approximately $16 billion. The acquisition increases the Company's investment in India, a large, growing economy. In the\nsecond quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company finalized the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for the Flipkart acquisition as follows:\n•\nAssets of $24.1 billion, which comprise primarily of $2.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents, $2.8 billion in other current assets, $5.0 billion in intangible\nassets and $13.5 billion in goodwill. Of the intangible assets, $4.7 billion represents the fair value of trade names, each with an indefinite life, which were\nestimated using the income approach based on Level 3 unobservable inputs. The remaining $0.3 billion of intangible assets primarily relate to acquired\ntechnology with a life of 3 years. The goodwill arising from the acquisition consists largely of anticipated synergies and economies of scale primarily\nrelated to procurement and logistics and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes;\n•\nLiabilities of $3.7 billion, which comprise primarily of $1.8 billion of current liabilities and $1.7 billion of deferred income taxes; and\n74\n\n\n•\nNoncontrolling interest of $4.3 billion, for which the fair value ",

To finance the acquisition, the\nCompany used a combination of cash provided by long-term debt as discussed in Note 6 and cash on hand. The Flipkart results of operations since acquisition and\nthe pro forma financial information are immaterial.\nNote 13. Segments and Disaggregated Revenue\nSegments\nThe Company is engaged in the operation of retail, wholesale and other units, as well as eCommerce websites, located throughout the U.S., Africa, Argentina,\nCanada, Central America, Chile, China, India, Japan, Mexico and the United Kingdom. The Company previously operated in Brazil prior to the sale of the majority\nstake of Walmart Brazil in fiscal 2019 discussed in Note 12. The Company's operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart\nInternational and Sam's Club. The Company defines its segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\") regularly\nreviews to analyze performance and allocate resources. The Company sells similar individual products and services in each of its segments. It is impracticable to\nsegregate and identify revenues for each of these individual products and services.\nThe Walmart U.S. segment includes the Company's mass merchant concept in the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. The Walmart\nInternational segment consists of the Company's operations outside of the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. The Sam's Club segment\nincludes the warehouse membership clubs in the U.S., as well as samsclub.com and omni-channel initiatives. Corporate and support consists of corporate overhead\nand other items not allocated to any of the Company's segments.\nThe Company measures the results of its segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain corporate\noverhead allocations. From time to time, the Company revises the measurement of each segment's operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations,\nas determined by the information regularly reviewed by its CODM.

Each of the Company’s securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act are listed on The New\nYork Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”). References in this Exhibit to the “Company,” “us,” “we” and “our” are solely to Walmart Inc.\n(parent company only) and not to any of its subsidiaries, unless the context requires otherwise.\nDESCRIPTION OF COMMON STOCK\nThe following is a description of the rights of holders of the Company’s Common Stock and related provisions of the Company’s\nRestated  Certificate  of  Incorporation  (the  “Certificate”)  and  Amended  and  Restated  Bylaws  (the  “Bylaws”)  and  applicable\nDelaware law, including the General Corporation Law of Delaware, as amended (the “DGCL”). This description is qualified in its\nentirety by, and should be read in conjunction with, the Certificate, Bylaws and applicable Delaware law.\nAuthorized Capital Stock\nPursuant to our Certificate, our authorized capital stock consists of 11,100,000,000 shares, with a par value of $0.10 per share, of\nwhich 11,000,000,000 shares are designated as Common Stock and 100,000,000 shares are designated as preferred stock.

A share of Common Stock is fully paid and non-\nassessable if such share has been issued for consideration legally permissible under the DGCL with a value at least equal to the par\nvalue per share of Common Stock. Holders of fully paid and non-assessable shares of the Common Stock will not be liable for any\nobligations or liabilities of the Company that the Company may fail to discharge.\nVoting Rights\nEach holder of shares of Common Stock is entitled to one vote for each share owned of record on all matters submitted to a vote of\nshareholders. Except as noted below or as otherwise required by the DGCL, the vote of shareholders required to decide any matter\nbrought before a shareholder meeting at which a quorum is present is a majority of the outstanding  shares present in person or\nrepresented by proxy at that meeting and entitled to vote on the question subject to the shareholder\n1\n\n\nvote. In a contested election of directors, which is an election in which there are more nominees for election than board positions to\nbe filled, directors are elected by the vote of a plurality of the outstanding shares present in person or represented by proxy at that\nmeeting and entitled  to vote on the election  of directors.

In addition, the DGCL requires the\nholders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our stock to approve any conversion of our corporation to another type of entity,\nsuch as a limited liability company. Our shareholders do not have cumulative voting rights as to the election of directors.\nDividends\nSubject to the preferential rights of any holders of any series of our preferred stock that may be issued in the future, the holders of\nshares of Common Stock are entitled to such dividends and distributions, whether payable in cash or otherwise, as may be declared\nfrom time to time by our board of directors from legally available funds.\nLiquidation Distributions\nSubject  to the preferential  rights  of any holders  of any series of our preferred  stock  that  may be issued  in  the future,  upon  our\nliquidation, dissolution or winding-up and after payment of all prior claims against our assets and our outstanding obligations, the\nholders shares of Common Stock will be entitled to receive, pro rata, all of our remaining assets.\nPreemptive, Conversion, Redemption or Similar Rights\nThe  holders  of  shares  of  Common  Stock  are  not  entitled  to  ",

Walton opened a\nfranchise Ben Franklin variety store in Newport, Arkansas. In 1946, his brother, James L. Walton, opened a similar store in Versailles, Missouri. Until 1962, our\nfounders' business was devoted entirely to the operation of variety stores. In that year, the first Wal-Mart Discount City, which was a discount store, opened in\nRogers, Arkansas. In 1983, we opened our first Sam's Club, and in 1988, we opened our first supercenter. In 1998, we opened our first Walmart Neighborhood\nMarket. In 1991, we began our first international initiative when we entered into a joint venture in Mexico. Since then, our international presence has expanded\nand, as of January 31, 2020, our Walmart International segment conducted business in 26 countries.\nIn 2000, we began our first eCommerce initiative by creating walmart.com and then later that year, adding samsclub.com. Since then, our eCommerce presence has\ncontinued to grow. In 2007, leveraging our physical stores, walmart.com launched its Site to Store service, enabling customers to make a purchase online and pick\nup merchandise in stores. Since 2016, we have made several eCommerce acquisitions which have enabled us to leverage technology, talent and expertise, as well\nas incubate digitally-native brands and expand our assortment on walmart.com and in stores. In fiscal 2017, walmart.com launched free two-day shipping and we\ncreated Store No 8, a technology incubator with a focus to drive eCommerce innovation. Then in fiscal 2019, we continued to enhance our eCommerce initiatives\nwith the acquisition of a majority stake of Flipkart Private Limited (\"Flipkart\"), an Indian-based eCommerce marketplace, with an ecosystem that includes\neCommerce platforms of Flipkart and Myntra as well as PhonePe, a digital transaction platform.\nIn fiscal 2020, we launched NextDay Delivery to more than 75 percent of the U.S. population, launched Delivery Unlimited from 1,600 locations in the U.S. and\nexpanded Same Day Pickup to nearly 3,200 locations. Our eCommerce efforts and innovation have also led to omni-channel offerings in many of our markets\nincluding grocery pick up and/or delivery in nearly a dozen countries outside the U.S. To date, we now have more than 6,100 grocery pick up and delivery\nlocations globally. We are enhancing our ecosystem with our omni-channel capabilities, stores, services, eCommerce sites, supply chain combined with our more\nthan 2.2 million associates to better serve our customers. Together, we believe these elements produce a flywheel effect which creates customer relationships where\ncustomers view Walmart as their primary destination.\n7\n\n\nInformation About Our Segments\nWe are engaged in global operations of retail, wholesale and other units, as well as eCommerce, located throughout the U.S., Africa, Argentina, Canada, Central\nAmerica, Chile",

Our operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart\nInternational and Sam's Club. We define our segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\") regularly reviews to\nanalyze performance and allocate resources. Each of our segments contributes to the Company's operating results differently. Each, however, has generally\nmaintained a consistent contribution rate to the Company's net sales and operating income in recent years other than minor changes to the contribution rate for the\nWalmart International segment due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We sell similar individual products and services in each of our segments. It is\nimpracticable to segregate and identify revenues for each of these individual products and services.\nWe measure the results of our segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain corporate overhead\nallocations. From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations, as determined by the\ninformation regularly reviewed by our CODM. When the measurement of a segment changes, previous period amounts and balances are reclassified to be\ncomparable to the current period's presentation.\nWalmart U.S. Segment\nWalmart U.S. is our largest segment and operates in the U.S., including in all 50 states, Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico. Walmart U.S. is a mass merchandiser of\nconsumer products, operating under the \"Walmart\" and \"Walmart Neighborhood Market\" brands, as well as walmart.com and other eCommerce brands. Walmart\nU.S. had net sales of $341.0 billion for fiscal 2020, representing 66% of our fiscal 2020 consolidated net sales, and had net sales of $331.7 billion and $318.5\nbillion for fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. Of our three segments, Walmart U.S. has historically had the highest gross profit as a percentage of net sales (\"gross\nprofit rate\"). In addition, Walmart U.S. has historically contributed the greatest amount to the Company's net sales and operating income.\nOmni-channel. Walmart U.S. provides an omni-channel experience to customers, integrating retail stores and eCommerce, through services such as \"Same Day\nPickup,\" \"Same Day Delivery,\" \"Delivery Unlimited,\" \"NextDay Delivery,\" and \"Endless Aisle.\" As of January 31, 2020, we had nearly 3,200 grocery pickup\nlocations and over 1,600 delivery locations.

Our ability to develop and operate units at the right locations and\nto deliver a customer-centric omni-channel experience largely determines our competitive position within the retail industry. We employ many programs designed\nto meet competitive pressures within our industry. These programs include the following:\n•\nEDLP: our pricing philosophy under which we price items at everyday low prices so our customers trust that our prices will not change under frequent\npromotional activity;\n•\nEDLC: everyday low cost is our commitment to control expenses so our cost savings can be passed along to our customers; and\n•\nOmni-channel offerings such as Same Day Pickup and Same Day Delivery, where a customer places an order online and picks it up for free from a store\nor has it delivered; Delivery Unlimited, where a customer can receive unlimited grocery delivery for an annual fee; as well as free two-day shipping\nwithout an annual membership fee and free NextDay Delivery on an assortment of best-selling items.\nDistribution. For fiscal 2020, approximately 79% of Walmart U.S.'s purchases of store merchandise were shipped through our 162 distribution facilities, which are\nlocated strategically throughout the U.S. The remaining store merchandise we purchased was shipped directly from suppliers. General merchandise and dry grocery\nmerchandise is transported primarily through the segment's private truck fleet; however, we contract with common carriers to transport the majority of our\nperishable grocery merchandise.

Walmart International provides an omni-channel experience to customers, integrating retail stores and eCommerce, such as through services like\n\"Click & Collect\" in the United Kingdom, our grocery pick-up and delivery business in several other markets, our marketplaces, such as Flipkart in India, and a\ndigital transaction platform anchored in payments such as PhonePe in India.\nGenerally, retail units' selling area range in size from 1,400 square feet to 186,000 square feet. Our wholesale stores' selling area generally range in size from\n25,000 square feet to 156,000 square feet. As of January 31, 2020, Walmart International had nearly 3,200 grocery pickup and/or delivery locations across its\nmarkets.\nMerchandise. The merchandising strategy for Walmart International is similar to that of our operations in the U.S. in terms of the breadth and scope of\nmerchandise offered for sale. While brand name merchandise accounts for a majority of our sales, we have both leveraged U.S. private brands and developed\nmarket specific private brands to serve our customers with high quality, low priced items. Along with the private brands we market globally, such as \"Equate,\"\n\"George,\" \"Great Value,\" \"Holiday Time,\" \"Mainstays,\" \"Marketside\" and \"Parent's Choice,\" our international markets have developed market specific brands\nincluding \"Aurrera,\" \"Cambridge,\" \"Lide",

The hours of operation for operating units in Walmart International vary by country and by individual markets within countries, depending upon local\nand national ordinances governing hours of operation. Operating units in each country accept a variety of payment methods.\nSeasonal Aspects of Operations. Walmart International's business is seasonal to a certain extent. Historically, the segment's highest sales volume and operating\nincome have occurred in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. The seasonality of the business varies by country due to different national and religious holidays,\nfestivals and customs, as well as different weather patterns.\nCompetition. Walmart International competes with omni-channel retailers who operate department, drug, discount, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets,\nhypermarkets and supercenter-type stores, wholesale clubs, home-improvement stores, specialty electronics stores, cash & carry operations and convenience stores,\nand eCommerce retailers, as well as catalog businesses. Our ability to develop and operate units at the right locations and to deliver a customer-centric omni-\nchannel experience largely determines our competitive position within the retail industry. We believe price leadership is a critical part of our business model and\nwe continue to focus on moving our markets towards an EDLP approach. Additionally, our ability to operate food departments effectively has a significant impact\non our competitive position in the markets where we operate.\nDistribution. We utilize a total of 221 distribution facilities located in Argentina, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, Japan, Mexico, South Africa, India and\nthe United Kingdom. Certain of these facilities are used to ship merchandise to both our stores and customers on our eCommerce platforms. Through these\nfacilities, we process and distribute both imported and domestic products to the operating units of the Walmart International segment. During fiscal 2020,\napproximately 85% of Walmart International's purchases passed through these distribution facilities. Suppliers ship the balance of Walmart International's\npurchases directly to our stores in the various markets in which we operate. We ship merchandise purchased by customers on our eCommerce platforms by a\nnumber of methods from multiple locations including from our 88 dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers, as well as more than 2,500 eCommerce sort centers in\nIndia.\nSam's Club Segment\nSam's Club operates in 44 states in the U.S. and in Puerto Rico.

At\nSam's Club, we provide value at members-only prices, a quality merchandise assortment, and bulk sizing to serve both our Plus and Club members.

In many instances, we purchase merchandise from producers located near the\nstores and clubs in which such merchandise will be sold, particularly products in the \"fresh\" category.

A large number of associates turn over each year, although Walmart U.S. turnover has improved in recent\nyears as a result of our focus on increasing wages and providing improved tools, technology and training to associates.\nCertain information relating to retirement-related benefits we provide to our associates is included in Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition\nto retirement-related benefits, in the U.S. we offer a broad range of Company-paid benefits to our associates.

The federal government has\ncreated the potential for significant changes in trade policies, including tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries\nwhere we source many of the products we sell in our stores and clubs. Potential changes which have been discussed include the renegotiation or termination of\ntrade agreements and the imposition of higher tariffs on imports into the U.S. A significant portion of the general merchandise we sell in our U.S. stores and clubs\nis manufactured in other countries. Any such actions including the imposition of further tariffs on imports could increase the cost to us of such merchandise\n(whether imported directly or indirectly) and cause increases in the prices at which we sell such merchandise to our customers, which could materially adversely\naffect the financial performance of our U.S. operations and our business.\nWe are subject to income taxes and other taxes in both the U.S. and the foreign jurisdictions in which we currently operate or have historically operated. The\ndetermination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires judgment and estimation. Our income taxes\ncould be materially adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in\njurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in worldwide tax laws, tax\nrates, regulations or accounting principles.\nFor example, in December 2019, India enacted a bill which significantly reduced the corporate income tax for certain companies with operations in India. In the\nU.S., the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"Tax Act\") significantly changed income tax laws that affect U.S. corporations with additional guidance from the U.S.\ntax authority still pending.

Management measures the results of the\nCompany's segments using each segment's operating income, including certain corporate overhead allocations, as well as other measures. From time to time, we\nrevise the measurement of each segment's operating income and other measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating\ndecision maker.\nManagement also measures the results of comparable store and club sales, or comparable sales, a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and\nclubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period from the corresponding period in the previous\nyear. Walmart's definition of comparable sales includes sales from stores and clubs open for the previous 12 months, including remodels, relocations, expansions\nand conversions, as well as eCommerce sales. We measure the eCommerce sales impact by including all sales initiated online or through mobile applications,\nincluding omni-channel transactions which are fulfilled through our stores and clubs. Sales at a store that has changed in format are excluded from comparable\nsales when the conversion of that store is accompanied by a relocation or expansion that results in a change in the store's retail square feet of more than five\npercent. Additionally, sales related to acquisitions are excluded until such acquisitions have been owned for 12 months. Comparable sales are also referred to as\n\"same-store\" sales by others within the retail industry. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our calculation of\ncomparable sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nBeginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we updated our definition of what was previously referred to as traffic (a component, along with ticket, of\ncomparable sales). Traffic is now referred to as \"transactions\" and measures a percentage change in the number of sales transactions in our comparable stores, as\nwell as for comparable eCommerce activity.\nIn discussing our operating results, the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for countries\nwhere the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars or for countries experiencing hyperinflation. We calculate the effect of changes in currency\nexchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period’s currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year\nperiod’s currency exchange rates. Additionally, no currency exchange rate fluctuations are calculated for non-USD acquisitions until owned for 12 months.\nThroughout our discussion, we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. Volatility in currency exchange rates\nmay impact the results, including net sales and operating income,",

We measure return on capital with our return on assets, return on\ninvestment and free cash flow metrics. We also provide returns in the form of share repurchases and dividends, which are discussed in the Liquidity and Capital\nResources section.\nReturn on Assets and Return on Investment\nWe include Return on Assets (\"ROA\"), the most directly comparable measure based on our financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles in the U.S. (\"GAAP\"), and Return on Investment (\"ROI\") as metrics to assess returns on assets. While ROI is considered a non-GAAP\nfinancial measure, management believes ROI is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively Walmart is deploying\nits assets. Trends in ROI can fluctuate over time as management balances long-term strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts. ROA was 6.7% and 3.4%\nfor fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in ROA was primarily due to the increase in consolidated net income primarily due to the change in fair value\nof the investment in JD.com and lapping the $4.5 billion net loss recorded in fiscal 2019 related to the sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil, partially offset\nby the dilution to operating income related to Flipkart. ROI was 13.4% and 14.2% for fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease in ROI was due to the\ndecrease in operating income primarily as a result of the dilution from Flipkart as well as business restructuring charges recorded in fiscal 2020. The denominator\nremained relatively flat as the increase in average total assets due to the acquisition of Flipkart was offset by the decrease in average invested capital resulting from\nthe removal of the eight times rent factor upon adoption of ASU 2016-02, Leases (\"ASU 2016-02\") since operating lease right of use assets are now included in\ntotal assets.\n32\n\n\nWe define ROI as operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense for the trailing 12 months divided by average invested\ncapital during that period. We consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus average accumulated depreciation\nand average amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-02, rent for the trailing 12\nmonths multiplied by a factor of 8 is no longer included in the calculation of ROI on a prospective basis as operating lease assets are now capitalized.

A two-point average will be used for leased assets beginning in fiscal 2021, after one full year from the date of adoption of the new lease standard.\nFurther, beginning prospectively in fiscal 2020, rent expense in the numerator excludes short-term and variable lease costs as these costs are not included in the\noperating lease right of use asset balance.\nPrior to adoption of ASU 2016-02, we defined ROI as operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense for the trailing 12\nmonths divided by average invested capital during that period. We considered average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets,\nplus average accumulated depreciation and average amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period, plus a rent factor\nequal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing 12 months multiplied by a factor of 8, which estimated the hypothetical capitalization of our operating leases.\nBecause the new lease standard was adopted under the modified retrospective approach as of February 1, 2019, our calculation of ROI for fiscal 2019 was not\nrevised.\nOur calculation of ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROI using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are\nincluded and excluded in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. For example, we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our\nreported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of ROI. As mentioned above, we consider ROA to be the financial measure computed in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles most directly comparable to our calculation of ROI. ROI differs from ROA (which is consolidated net\nincome for the period divided by average total assets for the period) because ROI: adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest\nincome; and adjusts total assets for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization, accounts payable and accrued liabilities to arrive at total invested\ncapital. Because of the adjustments mentioned above, we believe ROI more accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to\ninvestors than ROA. Although ROI is a standard financial measure, numerous methods exist for calculating a company's ROI. As a result, the method used by\nmanagement to calculate our ROI may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their ROI.\nThe calculation of ROA and ROI, along with a reconciliation of ROI to the calculation of ROA, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, is as follows:\n \nFiscal Years Ended January 31,\n(Amounts in millions)\n2020\n2019\nCALCULATION OF RETURN ON ASSETS\nNumerator\n",

Management believes, however, that free cash flow, which measures our ability to generate additional\ncash from our business operations, is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the Company's financial performance. Free cash flow should be\nconsidered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a\nmeasure of our liquidity. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for discussions of GAAP metrics including net cash provided by operating activities, net cash used in\ninvesting activities and net cash used in financing activities.\nWe define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period. We had net cash\nprovided by operating activities of $25.3 billion, $27.8 billion and $28.3 billion for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We generated free cash flow of $14.6\nbillion, $17.4 billion and $18.3 billion for fiscal 2020, 2019 an",

Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2020 declined when\ncompared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to the contribution to our Asda pension plan in anticipation of its future settlement, the inclusion of a full year of Flipkart\noperations, and the timing of vendor payments. Free cash flow for fiscal 2020 declined when compared to fiscal 2019 due to the same reasons as the decline in net\ncash provided by operating activities, as well as $0.4 billion in increased capital expenditures. Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2019 declined\nwhen compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to timing of vendor payments, partially offset by lower tax payments mainly resulting from the Tax Act and the\ntiming of tax payments. Free cash flow for fiscal 2019 declined when compared to fiscal 2018 due to the same reasons as the decline in net cash provided by\noperating activities, as well as $0.3 billion in increased capital expenditures.\nWalmart's definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the\nmeasure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, we\nbelieve it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nAlthough other companies report their free cash flow, numerous methods may exist for calculating a company's free cash flow. As a result, the method used by\nmanagement to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net cash provided by operating activities, which we believe to\nbe the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow, as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used\nin financing activities.\n \nFiscal Years Ended January 31,\n(Amounts in millions)\n2020\n2019\n2018\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n25,255\n$\n27,753\n$\n28,337\nPayments for property and equipment\n(10,705)\n(10,344)\n(10,051)\nFree cash flow\n$\n14,550\n$\n17,409\n$\n18,286\nNet cash used in investing activities(1)\n$\n(9,128)\n$\n(24,036)\n$\n(9,079)\nNet cash used in financing activities\n(14,299)\n(2,537)\n(19,875)\n(1) \"Net cash used in investing activities\" includes payments for property and equipment, which is also included in our computation of free cash flow.\n34\n\n\nResults of Operations\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nFiscal Years Ended January 31,\n(Amounts in millions, except unit counts)\n2020\n2019\n2018\nTotal revenues\n$\n523,964\n$\n514,405\n$\n500,343\nPercentage change from comparable period\n1.9%\n2.8%\n3.0%\nNet sales\n$\n519,926\n$\n510,329\n$\n495,761\nPercentage change from comparable period\n1.9%\n2.9%\n3.0%\nTotal U.S. calen",

These increases in revenues were due to increases in net sales, which increased $9.6 billion or 1.9% and\n$14.6 billion or 2.9% for fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.

These increases were partially offset by $4.1 billion of negative impact from\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates in fiscal 2020 and our sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil in August 2018. For fiscal 2019, net sales were\npositively impacted by overall positive comparable sales for Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments, along with positive comparable sales in the majority of our\nInternational markets and net sales from Flipkart, which we acquired in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. Additionally, for fiscal 2019, the increase in net sales was\npartially offset by a $4.5 billion decrease in net sales due to club closures in the Sam's Club segment during fiscal 2018, a $3.1 billion reduction in net sales due to\nthe sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil in the International segment, and $0.7 billion of negative impact from fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\nOur gross profit rate decreased 40 and 18 basis points for fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2020, these\ndecreases were primarily due to price investment in the Walmart U.S. segment and the addition of Flipkart in the Walmart International segment, partially offset by\nfavorable merchandise mix including strength in private brands and less pressure from transportation costs in the Walmart U.S. segment. For fiscal 2019, the\ndecrease was due to the mix effects from our growing eCommerce business, the acquisition of Flipkart, our planned pricing strategy and increased transportation\nexpenses.\nFor fiscal 2020, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 8 basis points, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year due to our\nfocus on expense management combined with our gro",

The primary drivers of the\nexpense leverage were strong sales performance in conjunction with productivity improvements and lapping approximately $1.8 billion in certain charges in fiscal\n2018. The improvements in fiscal 2019 were partially offset by additional investments in eCommerce and technology, as well as a $0.2 billion charge related to a\nsecurities class action lawsuit.\nOther gains and losses consisted of a gain of $2.0 billion for fiscal 2020 and a loss of $8.4 billion for fiscal 2019. The gain in fiscal 2020 was primarily the result of\na $1.9 billion increase in the market value of our investment in JD.com. The loss in fiscal 2019 is primarily the result of the $4.8 billion pre-tax loss on the sale of\nthe majority stake in Walmart Brazil and a $3.5 billion decrease in the market value of our investment in JD.com.

The decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 is\nprimarily due to the fiscal 2019 loss on sale of a majority stake in Walmart Brazil, which increased the comparative period's effective tax rate, as it provided\nminimal realizable tax benefit. The increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 is primarily due to the aforementioned loss on sale of a majority stake in\nWalmart Brazil and Flipkart's results. Additionally, our effective income tax rate may also fluctuate as a result of various factors, including changes in our\nassessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix and\nsize of earnings among our U.S. operations and international operations, which are subject to statutory rates that, beginning in fiscal 2019, are generally higher than\nthe U.S. statutory rate.

          "chunk": "terminology. In preparing the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, we follow accounting principles generally accepted in the\nU.S. These principles require us to make certain estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations as reflected in our\nfinancial statements. These judgments and estimates are based on past events and expectations of future outcomes. Actual results may differ from our estimates.\nManagement continually reviews our accounting policies, how they are applied and how they are reported and disclosed in our financial statements. Following is a\nsummary of our critical accounting estimates and how they are applied in preparation of the financial statements.\nInventories\nWe value inventories at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, using the last-in, first-out (\"LIFO\")\nmethod for Walmart U.S. segment's inventories. The inventory at the Sam's Club segment is valued using the weighted-average cost LIFO method. When\nnecessary, we record a LIFO provision for the estimated annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end. Our\nLIFO provision is calculated based on inventory levels, markup rates and internally generated retail price indices. As a measure of sensitivity, a 1% increase to our\nretail price indices would not have resulted in a decrease to the carrying value of inventory. As of January 31, 2020 and 2019, our inventories valued at LIFO\napproximated those inventories as if they were valued at FIFO.\nImpairment of Assets\nWe evaluate long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable.\nManagement's judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and financial performance. The evaluation of long-lived\nassets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally at the individual store level. The variability of these factors depends on a\nnumber of conditions, including uncertainty about future events and changes in demographics. Thus, our accounting estimates may change from period to period.\nThese factors could cause management to conclude that indicators of impairment exist and require impairment tests be performed, which could result in\nmanagement determining the value of long-lived assets is impaired, resulting in a write-down of the related long-lived assets. Impairment charges recorded in fiscal\n2020 were\n42\n\n\nimmaterial. As a measure of sensitivity, fiscal 2020 impairment would not change materially with a 10% decrease in the undiscounted cash flows for the stores or\nclubs with indicators of impairment. While fiscal 2019 included a pre-tax loss of $4.8 billion related to the sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil, which\nincluded full impairment of all related-assets, there were no other material impairment ",

          "chunk": "material impairment charges for fiscal 2019.\nBusiness Combinations, Goodwill, and Acquired Intangible Assets\nWe account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control is obtained, all the assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed, including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, are recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. The\ndetermination of fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities requires estimates and the use of valuation techniques when market value is not readily available.\nFor intangible assets acquired in a business combination, we typically use the income method. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but\nare not limited to, the amount and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, discount rates and useful lives. The excess of the purchase price over fair values of\nidentifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.\nGoodwill is assigned to the reporting unit which consolidates the acquisition. Components within the same reportable segment are aggregated and deemed a single\nreporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics. As of January 31, 2020, our reporting units consisted of Walmart U.S., Walmart\nInternational and Sam's Club. Goodwill and other indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets are not amortized, but are evaluated for impairment annually or\nwhenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of a certain asset may be impaired. Generally, this evaluation begins with a qualitative\nassessment to determine whether a quantitative impairment test is necessary. If we determine, after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factors, that\nthe fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, or that a fair value of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the\ncarrying amount cannot be assured, then a quantitative impairment test would be performed. The quantitative test for impairment requires management to make\njudgments relating to future cash flows, growth rates and economic and market conditions. These evaluations are based on determining the fair value of a reporting\nunit or asset using a valuation method such as discounted cash flow or a relative, market-based approach. Historically, our reporting units have generated sufficient\nreturns to recover the cost of goodwill, as the fair value significantly exceeded the carrying value. Our indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets have also\nhistorically generated sufficient returns to recover their cost; however, due to certain strategic restructuring decisions in fiscal 2020, we recorded approximately\n$0.7 billion in impairment related to acquired trade names and acquired developed software. Because of the nature of the factors used in these tests, if different\nconditions occur in future periods, future operating results could be materially impacted.\nC",

Accordingly, the\ndetermination of our provision for income taxes requires judgment, the use of estimates in certain cases and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws.\nOur effective income tax rate is affected by many factors, including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, increases and decreases in valuation\nallowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and international\noperations where the statutory rates are generally higher than the U.S. statutory rate, and may fluctuate as a result.\nOur tax returns are routinely audited and settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our tax provisions. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are\nrecorded in our financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from\ntaxing authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate. We\naccount for uncertain tax positions by determining the minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the\nfinancial statements. This determination requires the use of judgment in evaluating our tax positions and assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and\ntaxable items.\nDeferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years.

Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that a portion\nis not more likely than not to be realized. Many factors are considered when assessing whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized,\nincluding recent cumulative earnings, expectations of future taxable income, carryforward periods and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. The\nrecoverability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable\ntemporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. This evaluation relies on estimates.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"Tax Act\") was enacted and contains significant changes to U.S. income tax law. Effective\nbeginning January 2018, the Tax Act reduced the U.S. statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% and created new taxes on foreign-sourced earnings and related-party\npayments. As discussed in Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, we completed our accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act in fiscal 2019. As\nfurther guidance is issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard–setting bodies, any resulting changes to our estimates will be treated in\naccordance with the relevant accounting guidance.\nITEM 7A.\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nMarket Risk\nIn addition to the risks inherent in our operations, we are exposed to certain market risks, including changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and the fair\nvalue of our equity investment in JD.com.\nThe analysis presented below for each of our market risk sensitive instruments is based on a hypothetical scenario used to calibrate potential risk and does not\nrepresent our view of future market changes. The effect of a change in a particular assumption is calculated without adjusting any other assumption. In reality,\nhowever, a change in one factor could cause a change in another, which may magnify or negate other sensitivities.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our short-term borrowings and long-term debt. We hedge a portion of our interest rate risk by managing\nthe mix of fixed and variable rate debt and by entering into interest rate swaps. For fiscal 2020, the net fair value of our interest rate swaps increased $175 million\nprimarily due to fluctuations in market interest rates.\nThe table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For long-term debt, the table represents the\nprincipal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. For inter",

Based on January 31, 2020 debt levels, a 100 basis point change in prevailing market rates would cause our annual interest costs to change by\napproximately $61 million.\n44\n\n\nForeign Currency Risk\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates as a result of our net investments and operations in countries other than the U.S, as well our foreign-\ncurrency-denominated long-term debt. For fiscal 2020, movements in currency exchange rates and the related impact on the translation of the balance sheets of the\nCompany's subsidiaries in the UK and Mexico were the primary cause of the $0.3 billion gain in the currency translation and other category of accumulated other\ncomprehensive loss.\nWe hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk by entering into currency swaps. The aggregate fair value of these swaps was in a liability position of $241 million\nand asset position of $62 million as of January 31, 2020 and January 31, 2019, respectively. The change in the fair value of these swaps was due to fluctuations in\ncurrency exchange rates, primarily the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies in fiscal 2020. The hypothetical result of a uniform 10%\nweakening in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies underlying these swaps would have resulted in a change in the value of the swaps of $173\nmillion. A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates underlying these swaps from the market rates in effect as of January 31, 2020 would have resulted in a change\nin the value of the swaps of $42 million.\nIn addition to currency swaps, ",

Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to\nassess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such\nprocedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the\naccounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

For other matters, a liability is not probable, or the amount\ncannot be reasonably estimated and therefore an accrual has not been made. Where a liability is reasonably possible and may be\nmaterial, such matters have been disclosed. Management assessed the probability of occurrence and the estimation of any potential\nloss based on the ability to predict the number of claims that may be filed or whether any loss or range of loss can be reasonably\nestimated. For example, in assessing the probability of occurrence in a particular legal proceeding, management exercises judgment to\ndetermine if it can predict the number of claims that may be filed and whether it can reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that\nmay arise from that proceeding.\n47\n\n\nAuditing management’s accounting for, and disclosure of, loss contingencies was complex and highly judgmental as it involved our\nassessment of the significant judgments made by management when assessing the probability of occurrence or when determining\nwhether an estimate of the loss or range of loss could be made.\nHow We Addressed\nthe Matter in Our\nAudit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the identification and\nevaluation of contingencies. For example, we tested controls over the Company’s assessment of the likelihood of loss and the\nCompany’s determinations regarding the measurement of loss.\nTo test the Company’s assessment of the probability of occurrence or determination of an estimate of loss, or range of loss, among\nother procedures, we read the minutes of the meetings of the board of directors and committees of the board of directors, reviewed\nopinions provided to the Company by certain outside legal counsel, read letters received directly by us from internal and external\ncounsel, and evaluated the current status of contingencies based on discussions with internal legal counsel.

As disclosed in Notes 1, 8 and 12 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements, these assets are evaluated for impairment at least annually using valuation techniques to estimate\nfair value. These fair value estimates are sensitive to certain significant assumptions including revenue growth rates, discount rates,\nand royalty rates.\nAuditing management’s annual indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment tests was complex and highly judgmental due to the\nsignificant measurement uncertainty in determining the fair values of the indefinite-lived intangibles.

A company’s internal control over financial\nreporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of\nfinancial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of\nunauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with\nthe policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nRogers, Arkansas\nMarch 20, 2020\n49\n\n\nWalmart Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Income\nFiscal Years Ended January 31,\n(Amounts in millions, except per share data)\n2020\n2019\n2018\nRevenues:\nNet sales\n$\n519,926\n$\n510,329\n$\n495,761\nMembership and other income\n4,038\n4,076\n4,582\nTotal revenues\n523,964\n514,405\n500,343\nCosts and expenses:\nCost of sales\n394,605\n385,301\n373,396\nOperating, selling, general and administrative expenses\n108,791\n107,14",

Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The\nCompany consolidates variable interest entities where it has been determined that the Company is the primary beneficiary of those entities' operations. Investments\nfor which the Company exercises significant influence but does not have control are accounted for under the equity method. These variable interest entities and\nequity method investments are immaterial to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are based on a fiscal year ending on January 31 for the United States (\"U.S.\") and Canadian operations. The\nCompany consolidates all other operations generally using a one-month lag and based on a calendar year. There were no significant intervening events during the\nmonth of January 2020 related to the operations consolidated using a lag that materially affected the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nUse of Estimates\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Those principles require management\nto make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. Management's estimates and assumptions also affect the disclosure of\ncontingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results\nmay differ from those estimates.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers investments with a maturity when purchased of three months or less to be cash equivalents. All credit card, debit card and electronic\ntransfer transactions that process in less than seven days are classified as cash and cash equivalents. The amounts due from banks for these transactions classified as\ncash and cash equivalents totaled $1.7 billion and $1.4 billion as of January 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe Company's cash balances are held in various locations around the world. Most of the Company's $9.5 billion and $7.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents as of\nJanuary 31, 2020 and January 31, 2019 were held outside of the U.S. Cash and cash equivalents held outside of the U.S. are generally utilized to support liquidity\nneeds in the Company's non-U.S. operations.\nThe Company uses intercompany financing arrangements in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is needed with the minimum\ncost possible.\nAs of January 31, 2020 and 2019, cash and cash equivalents of approximately $2.3 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively, may not be freely transferable to the U.S.\ndue to local laws o",

Of the $2.3 billion as of January 31, 2020, approximately $0.6 billion can only be accessed through dividends or\nintercompany financing arrangements subject to approval of Flipkart Private Limited (\"Flipkart\") minority shareholders; however, this cash is expected to be\nutilized to fund the operations of Flipkart.\nReceivables\nReceivables are stated at their carrying values, net of a reserve for doubtful accounts, and are primarily due from the following: customers, which also includes\ninsurance companies resulting from pharmacy sales, banks for customer credit, debit cards and electronic transfer transactions that take in excess of seven days to\nprocess; suppliers for marketing or incentive programs; governments for income taxes; and real estate transactions. As of January 31, 2020 and January 31, 2019,\nreceivables from transactions with customers, net were $2.9 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively.\n55\n\n\nInventories\nThe Company values inventories at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, using the last-in, first-out\n(\"LIFO\") method for the Walmart U.S. segment's inventories. The inventory for the Walmart International segment is valued primarily by the retail inventory\nmethod of accounting, using the first-in, first-out (\"FIFO\") method. The retail inventory method of accounting results in inventory being valued at the lower of cost\nor market, since permanent markdowns are immediately recorded as a reduction of the retail value of inventory. The inventory at the Sam's Club segment is valued\nusing the weighted-average cost LIFO method. As of January 31, 2020 and January 31, 2019, the Company's inventories valued at LIFO approximated those\ninventories as if they were valued at FIFO.\nAssets Held for Sale\nAssets held for sale represent components and businesses that meet accounting requirements to be classified as held for sale and are presented as single asset and\nliability amounts in the Company's financial statements with a valuation allowance, if necessary, to recognize the net carrying amount at the lower of cost or fair\nvalue, less costs to sell.  The Company reviews all businesses and assets held for sale each reporting period to determine whether the existing carrying amounts are\nfully recoverable in comparison to estimated fair values.  As of January 31, 2020 and January 31, 2019, immaterial amounts for assets and liabilities held for sale\nwere classified in prepaid expenses and other and accrued liabilities, respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are initially recorded at cost. Gains or losses on disposition are recognized as earned or incurred. Costs of major improvements are\ncapitalized, while costs of normal repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. The following table summarizes the Company's property and equipment\nbalances and includes the estimated useful lives that are g",

Total\ndepreciation and amortization expense for property and equipment, property under finance leases and financing obligations, property under capital leases and\nintangible assets for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $11.0 billion, $10.7 billion and $10.5 billion, respectively.\nLeases\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which requires lease assets and liabilities to be recorded on the balance sheet.  The\nCompany adopted this ASU and related amendments as of February 1, 2019 under the modified retrospective approach and elected certain practical expedients\npermitted under the transition guidance, including to retain the historical lease classification as well as relief from reviewing expired or existing contracts to\ndetermine if they contain leases.  For leases subject to index or rate adjustments, the most current index or rate adjustments were included in the measurement of\noperating lease obligations at adoption.\nThe adoption of this ASU and related amendments resulted in a $14.8 billion increase to total assets and a $15.1 billion increase to total liabilities in the first\nquarter of fiscal 2020. In the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company recognized $16.8 billion and $17.5 billion of operating lease right-of-use assets and\noperating lease obligations, respectively, and removed $2.2 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively, of assets and liabilities related to financial obligations connected\nwith the construction of leased stores. Several other asset and liability line items in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet were also impacted by immaterial\namounts. Additionally, the adoption resulted in a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings of approximately $0.3 billion, net of tax, which primarily\nconsisted of the recognition of impairment. The Company’s Consolidated Statement of Income and Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows were immaterially\nimpacted. Accounting policies as a result of the adoption of this ASU are described below.  Refer to Note 7 for additional lease disclosures.\nFor any new or modified lease, the Company, at the inception of the contract, determines whether a contract is or contains a lease.

As the rate implicit in the Company's leases is not easily\ndeterminable, the Company’s applicable incremental borrowing rate is used in calculating the present value of the sum of the lease payments.\nLease term is defined as the non-cancelable period of the lease plus any options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will\nexercise the option. The Company has elected not to recognize ROU asset and lease obligations for its short-term leases, which are defined as leases with an initial\nterm of 12 months or less.\nFor a majority of all classes of underlying assets, the Company has elected to not separate lease from non-lease components. For leases in which the lease and non-\nlease components have been combined, the variable lease expense includes expenses such as common area maintenance, utilities, and repairs and maintenance.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nManagement reviews long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be\nrecoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is at the individual store or club level. Undiscounted cash flows\nexpected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over the assets' useful lives based on updated projections. If the evaluation indicates that the carrying\namount of the assets may not be recoverable, any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related asset or asset group as determined by an\nappropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique.\nGoodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations and is allocated to the appropriate reporting\nunit when acquired. Other acquired intangible assets are stated at the fair value acquired as determined by a valuation technique commensurate with the intended\nuse of the related asset. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized; rather, they are evaluated for impairment annually and whenever events\nor changes in circumstances indicate that the value of the asset may be impaired. Definite-lived intangible assets are considered long-lived assets and are amortized\non a straight-line basis over the periods that expected economic benefits will be provided.\nGoodwill is assigned to the reporting unit which consolidates the acquisition. Components within the same reportable segment are aggregated and deemed a single\nreporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics. As of January 31, 2020, the Company's reporting units consisted of Walmart U.S., Walmart\nInternational and Sam's Club. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment using either a qualitative or quantitative approach for each of the Company's reporting units.\nGenerally, a qua",

If management determines, after\nperforming an assessment based on the qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, or that a fair\nvalue of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured, then a quantitative goodwill impairment test would be required. The\nquantitative test for goodwill impairment is performed by determining the fair value of the related reporting units. Fair value is measured based on the discounted\ncash flow method and relative market-based approaches. After evaluation, management determined the fair value of each reporting unit is significantly greater than\nthe carrying amount and, accordingly, the Company has not recorded any impairment charges related to goodwill.\nThe following table reflects goodwill activity, by reportable segment, for fiscal 2020 and 2019:\n(Amounts in millions)\nWalmart U.S.\nWalmart\nInternational\nSam's Club\nTotal\nBalances as of February 1, 2018\n$\n2,445\n$\n15,484\n$\n313\n$\n18,242\nChanges in currency translation and other\n—\n(743)\n—\n(743)\nAcquisitions (1)\n107\n13,575\n—\n13,682\nBalances as of January 31, 2019\n2,552\n28,316\n313\n31,181\nChanges in currency translation and other\n—\n(149)\n—\n(149)\nAcquisitions\n41\n—\n—\n41\nBalances as of January 31, 2020\n$\n2,593\n$\n28,167\n$\n313\n$\n31,073\n(1) Goodwill recorded in fiscal 2019 for Walmart International relates to Flipkart.\nIntangible assets are included in other long-term assets in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Standard actuarial procedures and data analysis are used to estimate the liabilities associated with these risks as of the balance\nsheet date on an undiscounted basis. The recorded liabilities reflect the ultimate cost for claims incurred but not paid and any estimable administrative run-out\nexpenses related to the processing of these outstanding claim payments. On a regular basis, the liabilities are evaluated for appropriateness with claims reserve\nvaluations. To limit exposure to some risks, the Company maintains insurance coverage with varying limits and retentions, including stop-loss insurance coverage\nfor workers' compensation, general liability and auto liability.\nDerivatives\nThe Company uses derivatives for hedging purposes to manage its exposure to changes in interest and currency exchange rates, as well as to maintain an\nappropriate mix of fixed- and variable-rate debt.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences\nattributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases (\"temporary\ndifferences\"). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be\nrecovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nDeferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that a portion is not more likely than not to be realized.\nMany factors are considered when assessing whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, including recent cumulative earnings,\nexpectations of future taxable income, carryforward periods, and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. The recoverability of the deferred tax assets is\nevaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating\nearnings and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely on estimates.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act contains a provision which subjects a U.S. parent of a foreign subsidiary to current U.S. tax on its global intangible low–taxed income\n(“GILTI”).

The Company will report the tax impact of GILTI as a period cost when incurred. Accordingly, the Company is not providing deferred taxes for basis\ndifferences expected to reverse as GILTI.\nIn determining the provision for income taxes, an annual effective income tax rate is used based on annual income, permanent differences between book and tax\nincome, and statutory income tax rates.

Beginning January 2018, the Tax Act reduced the U.S. statutory tax\nrate and created new taxes focused on foreign-sourced earnings and related-party payments, including the creation of the base erosion anti-abuse tax and a new tax\non global intangible low-taxed income (\"GILTI\"). In addition, the Company was subject to a one-time transition tax in fiscal 2018 on accumulated foreign\nsubsidiary earnings not previously subject to U.S. income tax.\nThe SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"SAB 118\"), which allowed\ncompanies to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date. Due to the timing of the enactment\nand the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the Tax Act, the Company made reasonable estimates of the effects and recorded provisional amounts in\nits financial statements as of January 31, 2018, in accordance with SAB 118. The Company elected to apply the measurement period provisions of this guidance to\ncertain income tax effects of the Tax Act when it became effective. The provisional measurement period ended in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019.  Management\ncompleted the Company's accounting for Tax Reform in fiscal 2019 based on prevailing regulations and currently available information, and any additional\nguidance issued by the IRS could impact the aforementioned amounts in future periods. The net tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2018 related to the Tax Act was\n$207 million, and in fiscal 2019, the Company recorded $442 million of additional tax expense related to the Tax Act, included as a component of provision for\nincome taxes.\nOne-time Transition Tax\nThe Tax Act required the Company to pay U.S. income taxes on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously subject to U.S. income tax at a rate of\n15.5% to the extent of foreign cash and certain other net current assets, as defined by the Tax Act, and 8.0% on the remaining earnings. In fiscal 2018, the\nCompany recorded a provisional amount of $1.9 billion of additional income tax expense for its one-time transitional tax liability. The Company calculated the\nTransition Tax liability and increased the provisional amount by $413 million, with the increase included as a component of provision for income taxes in fiscal\n2019.\nDeferred Tax Effects\nThe Tax Act reduced the U.S. statutory tax rate fro",

In fiscal 2018, the Company\nrecognized a deferred tax benefit of $2.1 billion to reflect the reduced U.S. tax rate and other effects of the Tax Act.

As a result of the Tax\nAct, the Company reported and paid U.S. tax on the majority of its previously unremitted foreign earnings and repatriations of foreign earnings will generally be\nfree of U.S. federal tax, but may incur other taxes such as withholding or state taxes.  As of January 31, 2020, the Company has not recorded approximately $3\nbillion of deferred tax liabilities associated with remaining unremitted foreign earnings considered indefinitely reinvested, for which U.S. and foreign income and\nwithholding taxes would be due upon repatriation.\nNet Operating Losses, Tax Credit Carryforwards and Valuation Allowances\nAs of January 31, 2020, the Company's net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards totaled approximately $37.8 billion. Of these carryforwards,\napproximately $25.2 billion will expire, if not utilized, in various years through 2040. The remaining carryforwards have no expiration.\nThe recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including\ntaxable income in prior carryback years, reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. To the\nextent the Company does not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is generally established. To the\nextent that a valuation allowance was established and it is subsequently determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be recovered, the\nchange in the valuation allowance is recognized in the consolidated statements of income.\nThe Company had valuation allowances of $8.6 billion and $2.4 billion as of January 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, on deferred tax assets associated primarily\nwith net operating loss carryforwards for which management has determined it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Due to tax\nlaw changes in Luxembourg enacted in December 2019 the Company recognized additional deferred tax assets, and related valuation allowances, of $6.2 billion\nassociated with existing net operating loss carryforwards. Other activity in the valuation allowance during fiscal 2020 related to valuation allowance increases in\nother markets, as well as releases due to the expiration of underlying deferred tax assets.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nThe benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements only after determining a more-likely-than-not probability\nthat the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from taxing authorities.\nAs of January 31, 2",

The claimants allege that the work performed by employees in Asda's retail stores is of equal value in\nterms of, among other things, the demands of their jobs compared to that of employees working in Asda's warehouse and distribution facilities, and that the\ndifference in pay between these job positions disparately impacts women because more women work in retail stores while more men work in warehouses and\ndistribution facilities, and that the pay difference is not objectively justified. The claimants are requesting differential back pay based on higher wage rates in the\nwarehouse and distribution facilities and higher wage rates on a prospective basis.\nIn October 2016, following a preliminary hearing, the Employment Tribunal ruled that claimants could compare their positions in Asda's retail stores with those of\nemployees in Asda's warehouse and distribution facilities.

Under the terms of the sale, Advent agreed to\ncontribute additional capital to the business over a three-year period and Walmart agreed to indemnify Advent for certain matters.\nAs a result, the Company recorded a pre-tax net loss of $4.8 billion during fiscal 2019 in other gains and losses in the Company's Consolidated Statement of\nIncome. Substantially all of this charge was recorded during the second quarter of fiscal 2019 upon meeting the held for sale criteria. In calculating the loss, the fair\nvalue of the disposal group was reduced by $0.8 billion related to an indemnity, for which a liability was recognized upon closing and is recorded in deferred\nincome taxes and other in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Under the indemnity, the Company will indemnify Advent for certain pre-closing tax and\nlegal contingencies and other matters for up to R$2.3 billion, adjusted for interest based on the Brazilian interbank deposit rate.\nThe Company deconsolidated the financial statements of Walmart Brazil during the third quarter of fiscal 2019 and began accounting for its remaining 20 percent\nownership interest using the equity method of accounting. This equity method investment was determined to have no fair value and continues to have no carrying\nvalue.\nFlipkart\nIn August 2018, the Company acquired 81 percent of the outstanding shares, or 77 percent of the diluted shares, of Flipkart, an Indian-based eCommerce\nmarketplace, for cash consideration of approximately $16 billion. The acquisition increases the Company's investment in India, a large, growing economy. In the\nsecond quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company finalized the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for the Flipkart acquisition as follows:\n•\nAssets of $24.1 billion, which comprise primarily of $2.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents, $2.8 billion in other current assets, $5.0 billion in intangible\nassets and $13.5 billion in goodwill. Of the intangible assets, $4.7 billion represents the fair value of trade names, each with an indefinite life, which were\nestimated using the income approach based on Level 3 unobservable inputs. The remaining $0.3 billion of intangible assets primarily relate to acquired\ntechnology with a life of 3 years. The goodwill arising from the acquisition consists largely of anticipated synergies and economies of scale primarily\nrelated to procurement and logistics and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes;\n•\nLiabilities of $3.7 billion, which comprise primarily of $1.8 billion of current liabilities and $1.7 billion of deferred income taxes; and\n74\n\n\n•\nNoncontrolling interest of $4.3 billion, for which the fair value ",

To finance the acquisition, the\nCompany used a combination of cash provided by long-term debt as discussed in Note 6 and cash on hand. The Flipkart results of operations since acquisition and\nthe pro forma financial information are immaterial.\nNote 13. Segments and Disaggregated Revenue\nSegments\nThe Company is engaged in the operation of retail, wholesale and other units, as well as eCommerce websites, located throughout the U.S., Africa, Argentina,\nCanada, Central America, Chile, China, India, Japan, Mexico and the United Kingdom. The Company previously operated in Brazil prior to the sale of the majority\nstake of Walmart Brazil in fiscal 2019 discussed in Note 12. The Company's operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart\nInternational and Sam's Club. The Company defines its segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\") regularly\nreviews to analyze performance and allocate resources. The Company sells similar individual products and services in each of its segments. It is impracticable to\nsegregate and identify revenues for each of these individual products and services.\nThe Walmart U.S. segment includes the Company's mass merchant concept in the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. The Walmart\nInternational segment consists of the Company's operations outside of the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. The Sam's Club segment\nincludes the warehouse membership clubs in the U.S., as well as samsclub.com and omni-channel initiatives. Corporate and support consists of corporate overhead\nand other items not allocated to any of the Company's segments.\nThe Company measures the results of its segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain corporate\noverhead allocations. From time to time, the Company revises the measurement of each segment's operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations,\nas determined by the information regularly reviewed by its CODM.

Each of the Company’s securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act are listed on The New\nYork Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”). References in this Exhibit to the “Company,” “us,” “we” and “our” are solely to Walmart Inc.\n(parent company only) and not to any of its subsidiaries, unless the context requires otherwise.\nDESCRIPTION OF COMMON STOCK\nThe following is a description of the rights of holders of the Company’s Common Stock and related provisions of the Company’s\nRestated  Certificate  of  Incorporation  (the  “Certificate”)  and  Amended  and  Restated  Bylaws  (the  “Bylaws”)  and  applicable\nDelaware law, including the General Corporation Law of Delaware, as amended (the “DGCL”). This description is qualified in its\nentirety by, and should be read in conjunction with, the Certificate, Bylaws and applicable Delaware law.\nAuthorized Capital Stock\nPursuant to our Certificate, our authorized capital stock consists of 11,100,000,000 shares, with a par value of $0.10 per share, of\nwhich 11,000,000,000 shares are designated as Common Stock and 100,000,000 shares are designated as preferred stock.

A share of Common Stock is fully paid and non-\nassessable if such share has been issued for consideration legally permissible under the DGCL with a value at least equal to the par\nvalue per share of Common Stock. Holders of fully paid and non-assessable shares of the Common Stock will not be liable for any\nobligations or liabilities of the Company that the Company may fail to discharge.\nVoting Rights\nEach holder of shares of Common Stock is entitled to one vote for each share owned of record on all matters submitted to a vote of\nshareholders. Except as noted below or as otherwise required by the DGCL, the vote of shareholders required to decide any matter\nbrought before a shareholder meeting at which a quorum is present is a majority of the outstanding  shares present in person or\nrepresented by proxy at that meeting and entitled to vote on the question subject to the shareholder\n1\n\n\nvote. In a contested election of directors, which is an election in which there are more nominees for election than board positions to\nbe filled, directors are elected by the vote of a plurality of the outstanding shares present in person or represented by proxy at that\nmeeting and entitled  to vote on the election  of directors.

In addition, the DGCL requires the\nholders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our stock to approve any conversion of our corporation to another type of entity,\nsuch as a limited liability company. Our shareholders do not have cumulative voting rights as to the election of directors.\nDividends\nSubject to the preferential rights of any holders of any series of our preferred stock that may be issued in the future, the holders of\nshares of Common Stock are entitled to such dividends and distributions, whether payable in cash or otherwise, as may be declared\nfrom time to time by our board of directors from legally available funds.\nLiquidation Distributions\nSubject  to the preferential  rights  of any holders  of any series of our preferred  stock  that  may be issued  in  the future,  upon  our\nliquidation, dissolution or winding-up and after payment of all prior claims against our assets and our outstanding obligations, the\nholders shares of Common Stock will be entitled to receive, pro rata, all of our remaining assets.\nPreemptive, Conversion, Redemption or Similar Rights\nThe  holders  of  shares  of  Common  Stock  are  not  entitled  to  ",

Walton opened a\nfranchise Ben Franklin variety store in Newport, Arkansas. In 1946, his brother, James L. Walton, opened a similar store in Versailles, Missouri. Until 1962, our\nfounders' business was devoted entirely to the operation of variety stores. In that year, the first Wal-Mart Discount City, which was a discount store, opened in\nRogers, Arkansas. In 1983, we opened our first Sam's Club, and in 1988, we opened our first supercenter. In 1998, we opened our first Walmart Neighborhood\nMarket. In 1991, we began our first international initiative when we entered into a joint venture in Mexico. Since then, our international presence has expanded\nand, as of January 31, 2020, our Walmart International segment conducted business in 26 countries.\nIn 2000, we began our first eCommerce initiative by creating walmart.com and then later that year, adding samsclub.com. Since then, our eCommerce presence has\ncontinued to grow. In 2007, leveraging our physical stores, walmart.com launched its Site to Store service, enabling customers to make a purchase online and pick\nup merchandise in stores. Since 2016, we have made several eCommerce acquisitions which have enabled us to leverage technology, talent and expertise, as well\nas incubate digitally-native brands and expand our assortment on walmart.com and in stores. In fiscal 2017, walmart.com launched free two-day shipping and we\ncreated Store No 8, a technology incubator with a focus to drive eCommerce innovation. Then in fiscal 2019, we continued to enhance our eCommerce initiatives\nwith the acquisition of a majority stake of Flipkart Private Limited (\"Flipkart\"), an Indian-based eCommerce marketplace, with an ecosystem that includes\neCommerce platforms of Flipkart and Myntra as well as PhonePe, a digital transaction platform.\nIn fiscal 2020, we launched NextDay Delivery to more than 75 percent of the U.S. population, launched Delivery Unlimited from 1,600 locations in the U.S. and\nexpanded Same Day Pickup to nearly 3,200 locations. Our eCommerce efforts and innovation have also led to omni-channel offerings in many of our markets\nincluding grocery pick up and/or delivery in nearly a dozen countries outside the U.S. To date, we now have more than 6,100 grocery pick up and delivery\nlocations globally. We are enhancing our ecosystem with our omni-channel capabilities, stores, services, eCommerce sites, supply chain combined with our more\nthan 2.2 million associates to better serve our customers. Together, we believe these elements produce a flywheel effect which creates customer relationships where\ncustomers view Walmart as their primary destination.\n7\n\n\nInformation About Our Segments\nWe are engaged in global operations of retail, wholesale and other units, as well as eCommerce, located throughout the U.S., Africa, Argentina, Canada, Central\nAmerica, Chile",

Our operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart\nInternational and Sam's Club. We define our segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\") regularly reviews to\nanalyze performance and allocate resources. Each of our segments contributes to the Company's operating results differently. Each, however, has generally\nmaintained a consistent contribution rate to the Company's net sales and operating income in recent years other than minor changes to the contribution rate for the\nWalmart International segment due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We sell similar individual products and services in each of our segments. It is\nimpracticable to segregate and identify revenues for each of these individual products and services.\nWe measure the results of our segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain corporate overhead\nallocations. From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations, as determined by the\ninformation regularly reviewed by our CODM. When the measurement of a segment changes, previous period amounts and balances are reclassified to be\ncomparable to the current period's presentation.\nWalmart U.S. Segment\nWalmart U.S. is our largest segment and operates in the U.S., including in all 50 states, Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico. Walmart U.S. is a mass merchandiser of\nconsumer products, operating under the \"Walmart\" and \"Walmart Neighborhood Market\" brands, as well as walmart.com and other eCommerce brands. Walmart\nU.S. had net sales of $341.0 billion for fiscal 2020, representing 66% of our fiscal 2020 consolidated net sales, and had net sales of $331.7 billion and $318.5\nbillion for fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. Of our three segments, Walmart U.S. has historically had the highest gross profit as a percentage of net sales (\"gross\nprofit rate\"). In addition, Walmart U.S. has historically contributed the greatest amount to the Company's net sales and operating income.\nOmni-channel. Walmart U.S. provides an omni-channel experience to customers, integrating retail stores and eCommerce, through services such as \"Same Day\nPickup,\" \"Same Day Delivery,\" \"Delivery Unlimited,\" \"NextDay Delivery,\" and \"Endless Aisle.\" As of January 31, 2020, we had nearly 3,200 grocery pickup\nlocations and over 1,600 delivery locations.

Walmart U.S. competes with omni-channel retailers operating discount, department, retail and wholesale grocers, drug, dollar, variety and specialty\nstores, supermarkets, hypermarkets and supercenter-type stores, as well as eCommerce retailers. Our ability to develop and operate units at the right locations and\nto deliver a customer-centric omni-channel experience largely determines our competitive position within the retail industry. We employ many programs designed\nto meet competitive pressures within our industry. These programs include the following:\n•\nEDLP: our pricing philosophy under which we price items at everyday low prices so our customers trust that our prices will not change under frequent\npromotional activity;\n•\nEDLC: everyday low cost is our commitment to control expenses so our cost savings can be passed along to our customers; and\n•\nOmni-channel offerings such as Same Day Pickup and Same Day Delivery, where a customer places an order online and picks it up for free from a store\nor has it delivered; Delivery Unlimited, where a customer can receive unlimited grocery delivery for an annual fee; as well as free two-day shipping\nwithout an annual membership fee and free NextDay Delivery on an assortment of best-selling items.\nDistribution. For fiscal 2020, approximately 79% of Walmart U.S.'s purchases of store merchandise were shipped through our 162 distribution facilities, which are\nlocated strategically throughout the U.S. The remaining store merchandise we purchased was shipped directly from suppliers. General merchandise and dry grocery\nmerchandise is transported primarily through the segment's private truck fleet; however, we contract with common carriers to transport the majority of our\nperishable grocery merchandise.

Walmart International provides an omni-channel experience to customers, integrating retail stores and eCommerce, such as through services like\n\"Click & Collect\" in the United Kingdom, our grocery pick-up and delivery business in several other markets, our marketplaces, such as Flipkart in India, and a\ndigital transaction platform anchored in payments such as PhonePe in India.\nGenerally, retail units' selling area range in size from 1,400 square feet to 186,000 square feet. Our wholesale stores' selling area generally range in size from\n25,000 square feet to 156,000 square feet. As of January 31, 2020, Walmart International had nearly 3,200 grocery pickup and/or delivery locations across its\nmarkets.\nMerchandise. The merchandising strategy for Walmart International is similar to that of our operations in the U.S. in terms of the breadth and scope of\nmerchandise offered for sale. While brand name merchandise accounts for a majority of our sales, we have both leveraged U.S. private brands and developed\nmarket specific private brands to serve our customers with high quality, low priced items. Along with the private brands we market globally, such as \"Equate,\"\n\"George,\" \"Great Value,\" \"Holiday Time,\" \"Mainstays,\" \"Marketside\" and \"Parent's Choice,\" our international markets have developed market specific brands\nincluding \"Aurrera,\" \"Cambridge,\" \"Lide",

The hours of operation for operating units in Walmart International vary by country and by individual markets within countries, depending upon local\nand national ordinances governing hours of operation. Operating units in each country accept a variety of payment methods.\nSeasonal Aspects of Operations. Walmart International's business is seasonal to a certain extent. Historically, the segment's highest sales volume and operating\nincome have occurred in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. The seasonality of the business varies by country due to different national and religious holidays,\nfestivals and customs, as well as different weather patterns.\nCompetition. Walmart International competes with omni-channel retailers who operate department, drug, discount, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets,\nhypermarkets and supercenter-type stores, wholesale clubs, home-improvement stores, specialty electronics stores, cash & carry operations and convenience stores,\nand eCommerce retailers, as well as catalog businesses. Our ability to develop and operate units at the right locations and to deliver a customer-centric omni-\nchannel experience largely determines our competitive position within the retail industry. We believe price leadership is a critical part of our business model and\nwe continue to focus on moving our markets towards an EDLP approach. Additionally, our ability to operate food departments effectively has a significant impact\non our competitive position in the markets where we operate.\nDistribution. We utilize a total of 221 distribution facilities located in Argentina, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, Japan, Mexico, South Africa, India and\nthe United Kingdom. Certain of these facilities are used to ship merchandise to both our stores and customers on our eCommerce platforms. Through these\nfacilities, we process and distribute both imported and domestic products to the operating units of the Walmart International segment. During fiscal 2020,\napproximately 85% of Walmart International's purchases passed through these distribution facilities. Suppliers ship the balance of Walmart International's\npurchases directly to our stores in the various markets in which we operate. We ship merchandise purchased by customers on our eCommerce platforms by a\nnumber of methods from multiple locations including from our 88 dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers, as well as more than 2,500 eCommerce sort centers in\nIndia.\nSam's Club Segment\nSam's Club operates in 44 states in the U.S. and in Puerto Rico.

At\nSam's Club, we provide value at members-only prices, a quality merchandise assortment, and bulk sizing to serve both our Plus and Club members.

In many instances, we purchase merchandise from producers located near the\nstores and clubs in which such merchandise will be sold, particularly products in the \"fresh\" category.

In addition\nto retirement-related benefits, in the U.S. we offer a broad range of Company-paid benefits to our associates.

The federal government has\ncreated the potential for significant changes in trade policies, including tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries\nwhere we source many of the products we sell in our stores and clubs. Potential changes which have been discussed include the renegotiation or termination of\ntrade agreements and the imposition of higher tariffs on imports into the U.S. A significant portion of the general merchandise we sell in our U.S. stores and clubs\nis manufactured in other countries. Any such actions including the imposition of further tariffs on imports could increase the cost to us of such merchandise\n(whether imported directly or indirectly) and cause increases in the prices at which we sell such merchandise to our customers, which could materially adversely\naffect the financial performance of our U.S. operations and our business.\nWe are subject to income taxes and other taxes in both the U.S. and the foreign jurisdictions in which we currently operate or have historically operated. The\ndetermination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires judgment and estimation. Our income taxes\ncould be materially adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in\njurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in worldwide tax laws, tax\nrates, regulations or accounting principles.\nFor example, in December 2019, India enacted a bill which significantly reduced the corporate income tax for certain companies with operations in India. In the\nU.S., the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"Tax Act\") significantly changed income tax laws that affect U.S. corporations with additional guidance from the U.S.\ntax authority still pending.

Management measures the results of the\nCompany's segments using each segment's operating income, including certain corporate overhead allocations, as well as other measures. From time to time, we\nrevise the measurement of each segment's operating income and other measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating\ndecision maker.\nManagement also measures the results of comparable store and club sales, or comparable sales, a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and\nclubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period from the corresponding period in the previous\nyear. Walmart's definition of comparable sales includes sales from stores and clubs open for the previous 12 months, including remodels, relocations, expansions\nand conversions, as well as eCommerce sales. We measure the eCommerce sales impact by including all sales initiated online or through mobile applications,\nincluding omni-channel transactions which are fulfilled through our stores and clubs. Sales at a store that has changed in format are excluded from comparable\nsales when the conversion of that store is accompanied by a relocation or expansion that results in a change in the store's retail square feet of more than five\npercent. Additionally, sales related to acquisitions are excluded until such acquisitions have been owned for 12 months. Comparable sales are also referred to as\n\"same-store\" sales by others within the retail industry. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our calculation of\ncomparable sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nBeginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we updated our definition of what was previously referred to as traffic (a component, along with ticket, of\ncomparable sales). Traffic is now referred to as \"transactions\" and measures a percentage change in the number of sales transactions in our comparable stores, as\nwell as for comparable eCommerce activity.\nIn discussing our operating results, the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for countries\nwhere the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars or for countries experiencing hyperinflation. We calculate the effect of changes in currency\nexchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period’s currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year\nperiod’s currency exchange rates. Additionally, no currency exchange rate fluctuations are calculated for non-USD acquisitions until owned for 12 months.\nThroughout our discussion, we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. Volatility in currency exchange rates\nmay impact the results, including net sales and operating income,",

The primary drivers of the\nexpense leverage were strong sales performance in conjunction with productivity improvements and lapping of certain fiscal 2018 charges.

We measure return on capital with our return on assets, return on\ninvestment and free cash flow metrics. We also provide returns in the form of share repurchases and dividends, which are discussed in the Liquidity and Capital\nResources section.\nReturn on Assets and Return on Investment\nWe include Return on Assets (\"ROA\"), the most directly comparable measure based on our financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles in the U.S. (\"GAAP\"), and Return on Investment (\"ROI\") as metrics to assess returns on assets. While ROI is considered a non-GAAP\nfinancial measure, management believes ROI is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively Walmart is deploying\nits assets. Trends in ROI can fluctuate over time as management balances long-term strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts. ROA was 6.7% and 3.4%\nfor fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in ROA was primarily due to the increase in consolidated net income primarily due to the change in fair value\nof the investment in JD.com and lapping the $4.5 billion net loss recorded in fiscal 2019 related to the sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil, partially offset\nby the dilution to operating income related to Flipkart. ROI was 13.4% and 14.2% for fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease in ROI was due to the\ndecrease in operating income primarily as a result of the dilution from Flipkart as well as business restructuring charges recorded in fiscal 2020. The denominator\nremained relatively flat as the increase in average total assets due to the acquisition of Flipkart was offset by the decrease in average invested capital resulting from\nthe removal of the eight times rent factor upon adoption of ASU 2016-02, Leases (\"ASU 2016-02\") since operating lease right of use assets are now included in\ntotal assets.\n32\n\n\nWe define ROI as operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense for the trailing 12 months divided by average invested\ncapital during that period. We consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus average accumulated depreciation\nand average amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-02, rent for the trailing 12\nmonths multiplied by a factor of 8 is no longer included in the calculation of ROI on a prospective basis as operating lease assets are now capitalized.

A two-point average will be used for leased assets beginning in fiscal 2021, after one full year from the date of adoption of the new lease standard.\nFurther, beginning prospectively in fiscal 2020, rent expense in the numerator excludes short-term and variable lease costs as these costs are not included in the\noperating lease right of use asset balance.\nPrior to adoption of ASU 2016-02, we defined ROI as operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense for the trailing 12\nmonths divided by average invested capital during that period. We considered average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets,\nplus average accumulated depreciation and average amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period, plus a rent factor\nequal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing 12 months multiplied by a factor of 8, which estimated the hypothetical capitalization of our operating leases.\nBecause the new lease standard was adopted under the modified retrospective approach as of February 1, 2019, our calculation of ROI for fiscal 2019 was not\nrevised.\nOur calculation of ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROI using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are\nincluded and excluded in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. For example, we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our\nreported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of ROI. As mentioned above, we consider ROA to be the financial measure computed in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles most directly comparable to our calculation of ROI. ROI differs from ROA (which is consolidated net\nincome for the period divided by average total assets for the period) because ROI: adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest\nincome; and adjusts total assets for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization, accounts payable and accrued liabilities to arrive at total invested\ncapital. Because of the adjustments mentioned above, we believe ROI more accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to\ninvestors than ROA. Although ROI is a standard financial measure, numerous methods exist for calculating a company's ROI. As a result, the method used by\nmanagement to calculate our ROI may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their ROI.\nThe calculation of ROA and ROI, along with a reconciliation of ROI to the calculation of ROA, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, is as follows:\n \nFiscal Years Ended January 31,\n(Amounts in millions)\n2020\n2019\nCALCULATION OF RETURN ON ASSETS\nNumerator\n",

Management believes, however, that free cash flow, which measures our ability to generate additional\ncash from our business operations, is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the Company's financial performance. Free cash flow should be\nconsidered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a\nmeasure of our liquidity. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for discussions of GAAP metrics including net cash provided by operating activities, net cash used in\ninvesting activities and net cash used in financing activities.\nWe define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period. We had net cash\nprovided by operating activities of $25.3 billion, $27.8 billion and $28.3 billion for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We generated free cash flow of $14.6\nbillion, $17.4 billion and $18.3 billion for fiscal 2020, 2019 an",

Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2020 declined when\ncompared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to the contribution to our Asda pension plan in anticipation of its future settlement, the inclusion of a full year of Flipkart\noperations, and the timing of vendor payments. Free cash flow for fiscal 2020 declined when compared to fiscal 2019 due to the same reasons as the decline in net\ncash provided by operating activities, as well as $0.4 billion in increased capital expenditures. Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2019 declined\nwhen compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to timing of vendor payments, partially offset by lower tax payments mainly resulting from the Tax Act and the\ntiming of tax payments. Free cash flow for fiscal 2019 declined when compared to fiscal 2018 due to the same reasons as the decline in net cash provided by\noperating activities, as well as $0.3 billion in increased capital expenditures.\nWalmart's definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the\nmeasure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, we\nbelieve it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nAlthough other companies report their free cash flow, numerous methods may exist for calculating a company's free cash flow. As a result, the method used by\nmanagement to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net cash provided by operating activities, which we believe to\nbe the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow, as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used\nin financing activities.\n \nFiscal Years Ended January 31,\n(Amounts in millions)\n2020\n2019\n2018\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n25,255\n$\n27,753\n$\n28,337\nPayments for property and equipment\n(10,705)\n(10,344)\n(10,051)\nFree cash flow\n$\n14,550\n$\n17,409\n$\n18,286\nNet cash used in investing activities(1)\n$\n(9,128)\n$\n(24,036)\n$\n(9,079)\nNet cash used in financing activities\n(14,299)\n(2,537)\n(19,875)\n(1) \"Net cash used in investing activities\" includes payments for property and equipment, which is also included in our computation of free cash flow.\n34\n\n\nResults of Operations\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nFiscal Years Ended January 31,\n(Amounts in millions, except unit counts)\n2020\n2019\n2018\nTotal revenues\n$\n523,964\n$\n514,405\n$\n500,343\nPercentage change from comparable period\n1.9%\n2.8%\n3.0%\nNet sales\n$\n519,926\n$\n510,329\n$\n495,761\nPercentage change from comparable period\n1.9%\n2.9%\n3.0%\nTotal U.S. calen",

These increases in revenues were due to increases in net sales, which increased $9.6 billion or 1.9% and\n$14.6 billion or 2.9% for fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.

These increases were partially offset by $4.1 billion of negative impact from\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates in fiscal 2020 and our sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil in August 2018. For fiscal 2019, net sales were\npositively impacted by overall positive comparable sales for Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments, along with positive comparable sales in the majority of our\nInternational markets and net sales from Flipkart, which we acquired in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. Additionally, for fiscal 2019, the increase in net sales was\npartially offset by a $4.5 billion decrease in net sales due to club closures in the Sam's Club segment during fiscal 2018, a $3.1 billion reduction in net sales due to\nthe sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil in the International segment, and $0.7 billion of negative impact from fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\nOur gross profit rate decreased 40 and 18 basis points for fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2020, these\ndecreases were primarily due to price investment in the Walmart U.S. segment and the addition of Flipkart in the Walmart International segment, partially offset by\nfavorable merchandise mix including strength in private brands and less pressure from transportation costs in the Walmart U.S. segment. For fiscal 2019, the\ndecrease was due to the mix effects from our growing eCommerce business, the acquisition of Flipkart, our planned pricing strategy and increased transportation\nexpenses.\nFor fiscal 2020, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 8 basis points, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year due to our\nfocus on expense management combined with our gro",

The primary drivers of the\nexpense leverage were strong sales performance in conjunction with productivity improvements and lapping approximately $1.8 billion in certain charges in fiscal\n2018. The improvements in fiscal 2019 were partially offset by additional investments in eCommerce and technology, as well as a $0.2 billion charge related to a\nsecurities class action lawsuit.\nOther gains and losses consisted of a gain of $2.0 billion for fiscal 2020 and a loss of $8.4 billion for fiscal 2019. The gain in fiscal 2020 was primarily the result of\na $1.9 billion increase in the market value of our investment in JD.com. The loss in fiscal 2019 is primarily the result of the $4.8 billion pre-tax loss on the sale of\nthe majority stake in Walmart Brazil and a $3.5 billion decrease in the market value of our investment in JD.com.

The decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 is\nprimarily due to the fiscal 2019 loss on sale of a majority stake in Walmart Brazil, which increased the comparative period's effective tax rate, as it provided\nminimal realizable tax benefit. The increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 is primarily due to the aforementioned loss on sale of a majority stake in\nWalmart Brazil and Flipkart's results. Additionally, our effective income tax rate may also fluctuate as a result of various factors, including changes in our\nassessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix and\nsize of earnings among our U.S. operations and international operations, which are subject to statutory rates that, beginning in fiscal 2019, are generally higher than\nthe U.S. statutory rate.

The decrease in net cash provided by operating\nactivities for fiscal 2019, when compared to the previous fiscal year, was primarily due to timing of vendor payments, partially offset by lower tax payments\nmainly resulting from Tax Reform and the timing of tax payments.\nCash Equivalents and Working Capital Deficit\nCash and cash equivalents were $9.5 billion and $7.7 billion as of January 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

          "chunk": "terminology. In preparing the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, we follow accounting principles generally accepted in the\nU.S. These principles require us to make certain estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations as reflected in our\nfinancial statements. These judgments and estimates are based on past events and expectations of future outcomes. Actual results may differ from our estimates.\nManagement continually reviews our accounting policies, how they are applied and how they are reported and disclosed in our financial statements. Following is a\nsummary of our critical accounting estimates and how they are applied in preparation of the financial statements.\nInventories\nWe value inventories at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, using the last-in, first-out (\"LIFO\")\nmethod for Walmart U.S. segment's inventories. The inventory at the Sam's Club segment is valued using the weighted-average cost LIFO method. When\nnecessary, we record a LIFO provision for the estimated annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end. Our\nLIFO provision is calculated based on inventory levels, markup rates and internally generated retail price indices. As a measure of sensitivity, a 1% increase to our\nretail price indices would not have resulted in a decrease to the carrying value of inventory. As of January 31, 2020 and 2019, our inventories valued at LIFO\napproximated those inventories as if they were valued at FIFO.\nImpairment of Assets\nWe evaluate long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable.\nManagement's judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and financial performance. The evaluation of long-lived\nassets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally at the individual store level. The variability of these factors depends on a\nnumber of conditions, including uncertainty about future events and changes in demographics. Thus, our accounting estimates may change from period to period.\nThese factors could cause management to conclude that indicators of impairment exist and require impairment tests be performed, which could result in\nmanagement determining the value of long-lived assets is impaired, resulting in a write-down of the related long-lived assets. Impairment charges recorded in fiscal\n2020 were\n42\n\n\nimmaterial. As a measure of sensitivity, fiscal 2020 impairment would not change materially with a 10% decrease in the undiscounted cash flows for the stores or\nclubs with indicators of impairment. While fiscal 2019 included a pre-tax loss of $4.8 billion related to the sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil, which\nincluded full impairment of all related-assets, there were no other material impairment ",

          "chunk": "material impairment charges for fiscal 2019.\nBusiness Combinations, Goodwill, and Acquired Intangible Assets\nWe account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control is obtained, all the assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed, including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, are recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. The\ndetermination of fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities requires estimates and the use of valuation techniques when market value is not readily available.\nFor intangible assets acquired in a business combination, we typically use the income method. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but\nare not limited to, the amount and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, discount rates and useful lives. The excess of the purchase price over fair values of\nidentifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.\nGoodwill is assigned to the reporting unit which consolidates the acquisition. Components within the same reportable segment are aggregated and deemed a single\nreporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics. As of January 31, 2020, our reporting units consisted of Walmart U.S., Walmart\nInternational and Sam's Club. Goodwill and other indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets are not amortized, but are evaluated for impairment annually or\nwhenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of a certain asset may be impaired. Generally, this evaluation begins with a qualitative\nassessment to determine whether a quantitative impairment test is necessary. If we determine, after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factors, that\nthe fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, or that a fair value of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the\ncarrying amount cannot be assured, then a quantitative impairment test would be performed. The quantitative test for impairment requires management to make\njudgments relating to future cash flows, growth rates and economic and market conditions. These evaluations are based on determining the fair value of a reporting\nunit or asset using a valuation method such as discounted cash flow or a relative, market-based approach. Historically, our reporting units have generated sufficient\nreturns to recover the cost of goodwill, as the fair value significantly exceeded the carrying value. Our indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets have also\nhistorically generated sufficient returns to recover their cost; however, due to certain strategic restructuring decisions in fiscal 2020, we recorded approximately\n$0.7 billion in impairment related to acquired trade names and acquired developed software. Because of the nature of the factors used in these tests, if different\nconditions occur in future periods, future operating results could be materially impacted.\nC",

We record a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable.\nWe also perform an assessment of the materiality of loss contingencies where a loss is either not probable or it is reasonably possible that a loss could be incurred\nin excess of amounts accrued. If a loss or an additional loss has at least a reasonable possibility of occurring and the impact on the financial statements would be\nmaterial, we provide disclosure of the loss contingency in the footnotes to our financial statements. We review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine\nwhether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or the range of the loss can be made. Although we are not able to\npredict the outcome or reasonably estimate a range of possible losses in certain matters described in Note 10 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements,\nand have not recorded an associated accrual related to these matters, an adverse judgment or negotiated resolution in any of these matters could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes have a significant effect on our net earnings. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Accordingly, the\ndetermination of our provision for income taxes requires judgment, the use of estimates in certain cases and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws.\nOur effective income tax rate is affected by many factors, including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, increases and decreases in valuation\nallowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and international\noperations where the statutory rates are generally higher than the U.S. statutory rate, and may fluctuate as a result.\nOur tax returns are routinely audited and settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our tax provisions. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are\nrecorded in our financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from\ntaxing authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate. We\naccount for uncertain tax positions by determining the minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the\nfinancial statements. This determination requires the use of judgment in evaluating our tax positions and assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and\ntaxable items.\nDeferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. Such assets arise because of",

Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that a portion\nis not more likely than not to be realized. Many factors are considered when assessing whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized,\nincluding recent cumulative earnings, expectations of future taxable income, carryforward periods and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. The\nrecoverability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable\ntemporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. This evaluation relies on estimates.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"Tax Act\") was enacted and contains significant changes to U.S. income tax law. Effective\nbeginning January 2018, the Tax Act reduced the U.S. statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% and created new taxes on foreign-sourced earnings and related-party\npayments. As discussed in Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, we completed our accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act in fiscal 2019. As\nfurther guidance is issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard–setting bodies, any resulting changes to our estimates will be treated in\naccordance with the relevant accounting guidance.\nITEM 7A.\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nMarket Risk\nIn addition to the risks inherent in our operations, we are exposed to certain market risks, including changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and the fair\nvalue of our equity investment in JD.com.\nThe analysis presented below for each of our market risk sensitive instruments is based on a hypothetical scenario used to calibrate potential risk and does not\nrepresent our view of future market changes. The effect of a change in a particular assumption is calculated without adjusting any other assumption. In reality,\nhowever, a change in one factor could cause a change in another, which may magnify or negate other sensitivities.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our short-term borrowings and long-term debt. We hedge a portion of our interest rate risk by managing\nthe mix of fixed and variable rate debt and by entering into interest rate swaps. For fiscal 2020, the net fair value of our interest rate swaps increased $175 million\nprimarily due to fluctuations in market interest rates.\nThe table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For long-term debt, the table represents the\nprincipal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. For inter",

Based on January 31, 2020 debt levels, a 100 basis point change in prevailing market rates would cause our annual interest costs to change by\napproximately $61 million.\n44\n\n\nForeign Currency Risk\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates as a result of our net investments and operations in countries other than the U.S, as well our foreign-\ncurrency-denominated long-term debt. For fiscal 2020, movements in currency exchange rates and the related impact on the translation of the balance sheets of the\nCompany's subsidiaries in the UK and Mexico were the primary cause of the $0.3 billion gain in the currency translation and other category of accumulated other\ncomprehensive loss.\nWe hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk by entering into currency swaps. The aggregate fair value of these swaps was in a liability position of $241 million\nand asset position of $62 million as of January 31, 2020 and January 31, 2019, respectively. The change in the fair value of these swaps was due to fluctuations in\ncurrency exchange rates, primarily the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies in fiscal 2020. The hypothetical result of a uniform 10%\nweakening in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies underlying these swaps would have resulted in a change in the value of the swaps of $173\nmillion. A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates underlying these swaps from the market rates in effect as of January 31, 2020 would have resulted in a change\nin the value of the swaps of $42 million.\nIn addition to currency swaps, ",

Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to\nassess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such\nprocedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.

For other matters, a liability is not probable, or the amount\ncannot be reasonably estimated and therefore an accrual has not been made. Where a liability is reasonably possible and may be\nmaterial, such matters have been disclosed. Management assessed the probability of occurrence and the estimation of any potential\nloss based on the ability to predict the number of claims that may be filed or whether any loss or range of loss can be reasonably\nestimated. For example, in assessing the probability of occurrence in a particular legal proceeding, management exercises judgment to\ndetermine if it can predict the number of claims that may be filed and whether it can reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that\nmay arise from that proceeding.\n47\n\n\nAuditing management’s accounting for, and disclosure of, loss contingencies was complex and highly judgmental as it involved our\nassessment of the significant judgments made by management when assessing the probability of occurrence or when determining\nwhether an estimate of the loss or range of loss could be made.\nHow We Addressed\nthe Matter in Our\nAudit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the identification and\nevaluation of contingencies. For example, we tested controls over the Company’s assessment of the likelihood of loss and the\nCompany’s determinations regarding the measurement of loss.\nTo test the Company’s assessment of the probability of occurrence or determination of an estimate of loss, or range of loss, among\nother procedures, we read the minutes of the meetings of the board of directors and committees of the board of directors, reviewed\nopinions provided to the Company by certain outside legal counsel, read letters received directly by us from internal and external\ncounsel, and evaluated the current status of contingencies based on discussions with internal legal counsel.

A company’s internal control over financial\nreporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of\nfinancial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of\nunauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with\nthe policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nRogers, Arkansas\nMarch 20, 2020\n49\n\n\nWalmart Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Income\nFiscal Years Ended January 31,\n(Amounts in millions, except per share data)\n2020\n2019\n2018\nRevenues:\nNet sales\n$\n519,926\n$\n510,329\n$\n495,761\nMembership and other income\n4,038\n4,076\n4,582\nTotal revenues\n523,964\n514,405\n500,343\nCosts and expenses:\nCost of sales\n394,605\n385,301\n373,396\nOperating, selling, general and administrative expenses\n108,791\n107,14",

Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The\nCompany consolidates variable interest entities where it has been determined that the Company is the primary beneficiary of those entities' operations. Investments\nfor which the Company exercises significant influence but does not have control are accounted for under the equity method. These variable interest entities and\nequity method investments are immaterial to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are based on a fiscal year ending on January 31 for the United States (\"U.S.\") and Canadian operations. The\nCompany consolidates all other operations generally using a one-month lag and based on a calendar year. There were no significant intervening events during the\nmonth of January 2020 related to the operations consolidated using a lag that materially affected the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nUse of Estimates\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Those principles require management\nto make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. Management's estimates and assumptions also affect the disclosure of\ncontingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results\nmay differ from those estimates.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers investments with a maturity when purchased of three months or less to be cash equivalents. All credit card, debit card and electronic\ntransfer transactions that process in less than seven days are classified as cash and cash equivalents. The amounts due from banks for these transactions classified as\ncash and cash equivalents totaled $1.7 billion and $1.4 billion as of January 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe Company's cash balances are held in various locations around the world. Most of the Company's $9.5 billion and $7.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents as of\nJanuary 31, 2020 and January 31, 2019 were held outside of the U.S. Cash and cash equivalents held outside of the U.S. are generally utilized to support liquidity\nneeds in the Company's non-U.S. operations.\nThe Company uses intercompany financing arrangements in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is needed with the minimum\ncost possible.\nAs of January 31, 2020 and 2019, cash and cash equivalents of approximately $2.3 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively, may not be freely transferable to the U.S.\ndue to local laws o",

Of the $2.3 billion as of January 31, 2020, approximately $0.6 billion can only be accessed through dividends or\nintercompany financing arrangements subject to approval of Flipkart Private Limited (\"Flipkart\") minority shareholders; however, this cash is expected to be\nutilized to fund the operations of Flipkart.\nReceivables\nReceivables are stated at their carrying values, net of a reserve for doubtful accounts, and are primarily due from the following: customers, which also includes\ninsurance companies resulting from pharmacy sales, banks for customer credit, debit cards and electronic transfer transactions that take in excess of seven days to\nprocess; suppliers for marketing or incentive programs; governments for income taxes; and real estate transactions. As of January 31, 2020 and January 31, 2019,\nreceivables from transactions with customers, net were $2.9 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively.\n55\n\n\nInventories\nThe Company values inventories at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, using the last-in, first-out\n(\"LIFO\") method for the Walmart U.S. segment's inventories. The inventory for the Walmart International segment is valued primarily by the retail inventory\nmethod of accounting, using the first-in, first-out (\"FIFO\") method. The retail inventory method of accounting results in inventory being valued at the lower of cost\nor market, since permanent markdowns are immediately recorded as a reduction of the retail value of inventory. The inventory at the Sam's Club segment is valued\nusing the weighted-average cost LIFO method. As of January 31, 2020 and January 31, 2019, the Company's inventories valued at LIFO approximated those\ninventories as if they were valued at FIFO.\nAssets Held for Sale\nAssets held for sale represent components and businesses that meet accounting requirements to be classified as held for sale and are presented as single asset and\nliability amounts in the Company's financial statements with a valuation allowance, if necessary, to recognize the net carrying amount at the lower of cost or fair\nvalue, less costs to sell.  The Company reviews all businesses and assets held for sale each reporting period to determine whether the existing carrying amounts are\nfully recoverable in comparison to estimated fair values.  As of January 31, 2020 and January 31, 2019, immaterial amounts for assets and liabilities held for sale\nwere classified in prepaid expenses and other and accrued liabilities, respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are initially recorded at cost. Gains or losses on disposition are recognized as earned or incurred. Costs of major improvements are\ncapitalized, while costs of normal repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. The following table summarizes the Company's property and equipment\nbalances and includes the estimated useful lives that are g",

Total\ndepreciation and amortization expense for property and equipment, property under finance leases and financing obligations, property under capital leases and\nintangible assets for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $11.0 billion, $10.7 billion and $10.5 billion, respectively.\nLeases\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which requires lease assets and liabilities to be recorded on the balance sheet.  The\nCompany adopted this ASU and related amendments as of February 1, 2019 under the modified retrospective approach and elected certain practical expedients\npermitted under the transition guidance, including to retain the historical lease classification as well as relief from reviewing expired or existing contracts to\ndetermine if they contain leases.  For leases subject to index or rate adjustments, the most current index or rate adjustments were included in the measurement of\noperating lease obligations at adoption.\nThe adoption of this ASU and related amendments resulted in a $14.8 billion increase to total assets and a $15.1 billion increase to total liabilities in the first\nquarter of fiscal 2020. In the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company recognized $16.8 billion and $17.5 billion of operating lease right-of-use assets and\noperating lease obligations, respectively, and removed $2.2 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively, of assets and liabilities related to financial obligations connected\nwith the construction of leased stores. Several other asset and liability line items in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet were also impacted by immaterial\namounts. Additionally, the adoption resulted in a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings of approximately $0.3 billion, net of tax, which primarily\nconsisted of the recognition of impairment. The Company’s Consolidated Statement of Income and Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows were immaterially\nimpacted. Accounting policies as a result of the adoption of this ASU are described below.  Refer to Note 7 for additional lease disclosures.\nFor any new or modified lease, the Company, at the inception of the contract, determines whether a contract is or contains a lease.

As the rate implicit in the Company's leases is not easily\ndeterminable, the Company’s applicable incremental borrowing rate is used in calculating the present value of the sum of the lease payments.\nLease term is defined as the non-cancelable period of the lease plus any options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will\nexercise the option. The Company has elected not to recognize ROU asset and lease obligations for its short-term leases, which are defined as leases with an initial\nterm of 12 months or less.\nFor a majority of all classes of underlying assets, the Company has elected to not separate lease from non-lease components. For leases in which the lease and non-\nlease components have been combined, the variable lease expense includes expenses such as common area maintenance, utilities, and repairs and maintenance.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nManagement reviews long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be\nrecoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is at the individual store or club level. Undiscounted cash flows\nexpected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over the assets' useful lives based on updated projections. If the evaluation indicates that the carrying\namount of the assets may not be recoverable, any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related asset or asset group as determined by an\nappropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique.\nGoodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations and is allocated to the appropriate reporting\nunit when acquired. Other acquired intangible assets are stated at the fair value acquired as determined by a valuation technique commensurate with the intended\nuse of the related asset. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized; rather, they are evaluated for impairment annually and whenever events\nor changes in circumstances indicate that the value of the asset may be impaired. Definite-lived intangible assets are considered long-lived assets and are amortized\non a straight-line basis over the periods that expected economic benefits will be provided.\nGoodwill is assigned to the reporting unit which consolidates the acquisition. Components within the same reportable segment are aggregated and deemed a single\nreporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics. As of January 31, 2020, the Company's reporting units consisted of Walmart U.S., Walmart\nInternational and Sam's Club. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment using either a qualitative or quantitative approach for each of the Company's reporting units.\nGenerally, a qua",

If management determines, after\nperforming an assessment based on the qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, or that a fair\nvalue of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured, then a quantitative goodwill impairment test would be required. The\nquantitative test for goodwill impairment is performed by determining the fair value of the related reporting units. Fair value is measured based on the discounted\ncash flow method and relative market-based approaches. After evaluation, management determined the fair value of each reporting unit is significantly greater than\nthe carrying amount and, accordingly, the Company has not recorded any impairment charges related to goodwill.\nThe following table reflects goodwill activity, by reportable segment, for fiscal 2020 and 2019:\n(Amounts in millions)\nWalmart U.S.\nWalmart\nInternational\nSam's Club\nTotal\nBalances as of February 1, 2018\n$\n2,445\n$\n15,484\n$\n313\n$\n18,242\nChanges in currency translation and other\n—\n(743)\n—\n(743)\nAcquisitions (1)\n107\n13,575\n—\n13,682\nBalances as of January 31, 2019\n2,552\n28,316\n313\n31,181\nChanges in currency translation and other\n—\n(149)\n—\n(149)\nAcquisitions\n41\n—\n—\n41\nBalances as of January 31, 2020\n$\n2,593\n$\n28,167\n$\n313\n$\n31,073\n(1) Goodwill recorded in fiscal 2019 for Walmart International relates to Flipkart.\nIntangible assets are included in other long-term assets in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences\nattributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases (\"temporary\ndifferences\"). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be\nrecovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nDeferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that a portion is not more likely than not to be realized.\nMany factors are considered when assessing whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, including recent cumulative earnings,\nexpectations of future taxable income, carryforward periods, and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. The recoverability of the deferred tax assets is\nevaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating\nearnings and available tax planning strategies.

The Company will report the tax impact of GILTI as a period cost when incurred. Accordingly, the Company is not providing deferred taxes for basis\ndifferences expected to reverse as GILTI.\nIn determining the provision for income taxes, an annual effective income tax rate is used based on annual income, permanent differences between book and tax\nincome, and statutory income tax rates.

Beginning January 2018, the Tax Act reduced the U.S. statutory tax\nrate and created new taxes focused on foreign-sourced earnings and related-party payments, including the creation of the base erosion anti-abuse tax and a new tax\non global intangible low-taxed income (\"GILTI\"). In addition, the Company was subject to a one-time transition tax in fiscal 2018 on accumulated foreign\nsubsidiary earnings not previously subject to U.S. income tax.\nThe SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"SAB 118\"), which allowed\ncompanies to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date. Due to the timing of the enactment\nand the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the Tax Act, the Company made reasonable estimates of the effects and recorded provisional amounts in\nits financial statements as of January 31, 2018, in accordance with SAB 118. The Company elected to apply the measurement period provisions of this guidance to\ncertain income tax effects of the Tax Act when it became effective. The provisional measurement period ended in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019.  Management\ncompleted the Company's accounting for Tax Reform in fiscal 2019 based on prevailing regulations and currently available information, and any additional\nguidance issued by the IRS could impact the aforementioned amounts in future periods. The net tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2018 related to the Tax Act was\n$207 million, and in fiscal 2019, the Company recorded $442 million of additional tax expense related to the Tax Act, included as a component of provision for\nincome taxes.\nOne-time Transition Tax\nThe Tax Act required the Company to pay U.S. income taxes on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously subject to U.S. income tax at a rate of\n15.5% to the extent of foreign cash and certain other net current assets, as defined by the Tax Act, and 8.0% on the remaining earnings. In fiscal 2018, the\nCompany recorded a provisional amount of $1.9 billion of additional income tax expense for its one-time transitional tax liability. The Company calculated the\nTransition Tax liability and increased the provisional amount by $413 million, with the increase included as a component of provision for income taxes in fiscal\n2019.\nDeferred Tax Effects\nThe Tax Act reduced the U.S. statutory tax rate fro",

In fiscal 2018, the Company\nrecognized a deferred tax benefit of $2.1 billion to reflect the reduced U.S. tax rate and other effects of the Tax Act.

As a result of the Tax\nAct, the Company reported and paid U.S. tax on the majority of its previously unremitted foreign earnings and repatriations of foreign earnings will generally be\nfree of U.S. federal tax, but may incur other taxes such as withholding or state taxes.  As of January 31, 2020, the Company has not recorded approximately $3\nbillion of deferred tax liabilities associated with remaining unremitted foreign earnings considered indefinitely reinvested, for which U.S. and foreign income and\nwithholding taxes would be due upon repatriation.\nNet Operating Losses, Tax Credit Carryforwards and Valuation Allowances\nAs of January 31, 2020, the Company's net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards totaled approximately $37.8 billion. Of these carryforwards,\napproximately $25.2 billion will expire, if not utilized, in various years through 2040. The remaining carryforwards have no expiration.\nThe recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including\ntaxable income in prior carryback years, reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. To the\nextent the Company does not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is generally established. To the\nextent that a valuation allowance was established and it is subsequently determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be recovered, the\nchange in the valuation allowance is recognized in the consolidated statements of income.\nThe Company had valuation allowances of $8.6 billion and $2.4 billion as of January 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, on deferred tax assets associated primarily\nwith net operating loss carryforwards for which management has determined it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Due to tax\nlaw changes in Luxembourg enacted in December 2019 the Company recognized additional deferred tax assets, and related valuation allowances, of $6.2 billion\nassociated with existing net operating loss carryforwards. Other activity in the valuation allowance during fiscal 2020 related to valuation allowance increases in\nother markets, as well as releases due to the expiration of underlying deferred tax assets.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nThe benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements only after determining a more-likely-than-not probability\nthat the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from taxing authorities.\nAs of January 31, 2",

The claimants allege that the work performed by employees in Asda's retail stores is of equal value in\nterms of, among other things, the demands of their jobs compared to that of employees working in Asda's warehouse and distribution facilities, and that the\ndifference in pay between these job positions disparately impacts women because more women work in retail stores while more men work in warehouses and\ndistribution facilities, and that the pay difference is not objectively justified. The claimants are requesting differential back pay based on higher wage rates in the\nwarehouse and distribution facilities and higher wage rates on a prospective basis.\nIn October 2016, following a preliminary hearing, the Employment Tribunal ruled that claimants could compare their positions in Asda's retail stores with those of\nemployees in Asda's warehouse and distribution facilities.

Under the terms of the sale, Advent agreed to\ncontribute additional capital to the business over a three-year period and Walmart agreed to indemnify Advent for certain matters.\nAs a result, the Company recorded a pre-tax net loss of $4.8 billion during fiscal 2019 in other gains and losses in the Company's Consolidated Statement of\nIncome. Substantially all of this charge was recorded during the second quarter of fiscal 2019 upon meeting the held for sale criteria. In calculating the loss, the fair\nvalue of the disposal group was reduced by $0.8 billion related to an indemnity, for which a liability was recognized upon closing and is recorded in deferred\nincome taxes and other in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Under the indemnity, the Company will indemnify Advent for certain pre-closing tax and\nlegal contingencies and other matters for up to R$2.3 billion, adjusted for interest based on the Brazilian interbank deposit rate.\nThe Company deconsolidated the financial statements of Walmart Brazil during the third quarter of fiscal 2019 and began accounting for its remaining 20 percent\nownership interest using the equity method of accounting. This equity method investment was determined to have no fair value and continues to have no carrying\nvalue.\nFlipkart\nIn August 2018, the Company acquired 81 percent of the outstanding shares, or 77 percent of the diluted shares, of Flipkart, an Indian-based eCommerce\nmarketplace, for cash consideration of approximately $16 billion. The acquisition increases the Company's investment in India, a large, growing economy. In the\nsecond quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company finalized the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for the Flipkart acquisition as follows:\n•\nAssets of $24.1 billion, which comprise primarily of $2.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents, $2.8 billion in other current assets, $5.0 billion in intangible\nassets and $13.5 billion in goodwill. Of the intangible assets, $4.7 billion represents the fair value of trade names, each with an indefinite life, which were\nestimated using the income approach based on Level 3 unobservable inputs. The remaining $0.3 billion of intangible assets primarily relate to acquired\ntechnology with a life of 3 years. The goodwill arising from the acquisition consists largely of anticipated synergies and economies of scale primarily\nrelated to procurement and logistics and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes;\n•\nLiabilities of $3.7 billion, which comprise primarily of $1.8 billion of current liabilities and $1.7 billion of deferred income taxes; and\n74\n\n\n•\nNoncontrolling interest of $4.3 billion, for which the fair value ",

To finance the acquisition, the\nCompany used a combination of cash provided by long-term debt as discussed in Note 6 and cash on hand. The Flipkart results of operations since acquisition and\nthe pro forma financial information are immaterial.\nNote 13. Segments and Disaggregated Revenue\nSegments\nThe Company is engaged in the operation of retail, wholesale and other units, as well as eCommerce websites, located throughout the U.S., Africa, Argentina,\nCanada, Central America, Chile, China, India, Japan, Mexico and the United Kingdom. The Company previously operated in Brazil prior to the sale of the majority\nstake of Walmart Brazil in fiscal 2019 discussed in Note 12. The Company's operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart\nInternational and Sam's Club. The Company defines its segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\") regularly\nreviews to analyze performance and allocate resources. The Company sells similar individual products and services in each of its segments. It is impracticable to\nsegregate and identify revenues for each of these individual products and services.\nThe Walmart U.S. segment includes the Company's mass merchant concept in the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. The Walmart\nInternational segment consists of the Company's operations outside of the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. The Sam's Club segment\nincludes the warehouse membership clubs in the U.S., as well as samsclub.com and omni-channel initiatives. Corporate and support consists of corporate overhead\nand other items not allocated to any of the Company's segments.\nThe Company measures the results of its segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain corporate\noverhead allocations. From time to time, the Company revises the measurement of each segment's operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations,\nas determined by the information regularly reviewed by its CODM.

Each of the Company’s securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act are listed on The New\nYork Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”). References in this Exhibit to the “Company,” “us,” “we” and “our” are solely to Walmart Inc.\n(parent company only) and not to any of its subsidiaries, unless the context requires otherwise.\nDESCRIPTION OF COMMON STOCK\nThe following is a description of the rights of holders of the Company’s Common Stock and related provisions of the Company’s\nRestated  Certificate  of  Incorporation  (the  “Certificate”)  and  Amended  and  Restated  Bylaws  (the  “Bylaws”)  and  applicable\nDelaware law, including the General Corporation Law of Delaware, as amended (the “DGCL”). This description is qualified in its\nentirety by, and should be read in conjunction with, the Certificate, Bylaws and applicable Delaware law.\nAuthorized Capital Stock\nPursuant to our Certificate, our authorized capital stock consists of 11,100,000,000 shares, with a par value of $0.10 per share, of\nwhich 11,000,000,000 shares are designated as Common Stock and 100,000,000 shares are designated as preferred stock.

A share of Common Stock is fully paid and non-\nassessable if such share has been issued for consideration legally permissible under the DGCL with a value at least equal to the par\nvalue per share of Common Stock. Holders of fully paid and non-assessable shares of the Common Stock will not be liable for any\nobligations or liabilities of the Company that the Company may fail to discharge.\nVoting Rights\nEach holder of shares of Common Stock is entitled to one vote for each share owned of record on all matters submitted to a vote of\nshareholders. Except as noted below or as otherwise required by the DGCL, the vote of shareholders required to decide any matter\nbrought before a shareholder meeting at which a quorum is present is a majority of the outstanding  shares present in person or\nrepresented by proxy at that meeting and entitled to vote on the question subject to the shareholder\n1\n\n\nvote. In a contested election of directors, which is an election in which there are more nominees for election than board positions to\nbe filled, directors are elected by the vote of a plurality of the outstanding shares present in person or represented by proxy at that\nmeeting and entitled  to vote on the election  of directors.

In addition, the DGCL requires the\nholders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our stock to approve any conversion of our corporation to another type of entity,\nsuch as a limited liability company. Our shareholders do not have cumulative voting rights as to the election of directors.\nDividends\nSubject to the preferential rights of any holders of any series of our preferred stock that may be issued in the future, the holders of\nshares of Common Stock are entitled to such dividends and distributions, whether payable in cash or otherwise, as may be declared\nfrom time to time by our board of directors from legally available funds.\nLiquidation Distributions\nSubject  to the preferential  rights  of any holders  of any series of our preferred  stock  that  may be issued  in  the future,  upon  our\nliquidation, dissolution or winding-up and after payment of all prior claims against our assets and our outstanding obligations, the\nholders shares of Common Stock will be entitled to receive, pro rata, all of our remaining assets.\nPreemptive, Conversion, Redemption or Similar Rights\nThe  holders  of  shares  of  Common  Stock  are  not  entitled  to  ",

What information we have gathered\n2. Whether it is sufficient to answer the question\n3. If not sufficient, what specific information is missing\n4. If sufficient, how we would calculate or derive the answer\n5. If there are conflicting answers:\n--> Use citations to select the correct answer if there are conflicting answers.\n\nBe brief and concise. No need for structured output - just think through the steps. You MUST respond in markdown format (for $ signs make sure to use escape character \\ before the $ sign).\n",
      "output": "1. **Information Gathered:**\n   - **Unadjusted Operating Income:** Several chunks provided figures for operating income, but there are inconsistencies and missing data for some years. For example, one chunk cited operating income as $20,568M for FY2020, $21,957M for FY2019, and $20,437M for FY2018.\n   - **Depreciation and Amortization:** Some chunks provided figures, such as $10,987M for FY2020, $10,678M for FY2019, and $10,529M for FY2018.\n   - **Total Revenue:** Multiple chunks provided total revenue figures, with one citing $523,964M for FY2020, $514,405M for FY2019, and $500,343M for FY2018.\n\n2. **Sufficiency of Information:**\n   - The information is nearly sufficient to calculate the unadjusted EBITDA % margin for each year. We have figures for operating income, depreciation and amortization, and total revenue for FY2018, FY2019, and FY2020.\n\n3. **Missing Information:**\n   - There are some inconsistencies in the operating income figures across different chunks. We need to ensure that the figures used are consistent and accurate.\n\n4. **Calculation:**\n   - To calculate the unadjusted EBITDA for each year, add the operating income to the depreciation and amortization for that year.\n   - Calculate the EBITDA % margin by dividing the unadjusted EBITDA by the total revenue for each year and multiplying by 100.\n   - Compute the 3-year average of these percentages.\n\n5. **Conflicting Answers:**\n   - For operating income, the most consistent figures across multiple chunks should be used. The figures $20,568M for FY2020, $21,957M for FY2019, and $20,437M for FY2018 appear in multiple chunks and should be considered reliable.\n   - For depreciation and amortization, the figures $10,987M for FY2020, $10,678M for FY2019, and $10,529M for FY2018 are consistent across chunks.\n   - For total revenue, the figures $523,964M for FY2020, $514,405M for FY2019, and $500,343M for FY2018 are consistent and should be used.\n\nWith this information, we can proceed to calculate the 3-year average unadjusted EBITDA % margin for Walmart."
