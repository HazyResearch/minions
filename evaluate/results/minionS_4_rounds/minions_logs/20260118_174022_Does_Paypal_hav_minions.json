If working capital is not a useful or relevant metric for this company, then please state that and explain why.\n\n---\n\nPlease provide succinct advice on the critical information we need to extract from the Financial document. Total length: 483929 characters to answer this question. \n\nAlso consider the following constraints:\n- In your response do NOT use numbered lists.\n- Do NOT structure your response as a sequence of steps.\n",
      "output": "To determine if PayPal has positive working capital based on FY2022 data, focus on extracting the current assets and current liabilities from the financial statements within the document. Working capital is calculated as current assets minus current liabilities. If the result is positive, PayPal has positive working capital, indicating it can cover its short-term obligations with its short-term assets. If the document suggests that working capital is not a relevant metric for PayPal, consider the nature of its business model. Companies with strong cash flows or those that operate in industries where working capital is less critical might not rely on this metric. PayPal, being a digital payments company, may have unique financial dynamics that make traditional working capital analysis less applicable. Look for any commentary or notes in the financial document that discuss liquidity management, cash flow, or operational efficiency, as these might provide insights into why working capital might not be a primary focus for PayPal."

      "prompt": "# Decomposition Round #1\n\nYou (the supervisor) cannot directly read the document(s). Instead, you can assign small, isolated tasks to a less capable worker model that sees only a single chunk of text at a time. Any cross-chunk or multi-document reasoning must be handled by you.\n\n## Your Job: Write Two Python Functions\n\n### FUNCTION #1: `prepare_jobs(context, prev_job_manifests, prev_job_outputs) -> List[JobManifest]`\n- Break the document(s) into chunks (using the provided chunking function, if needed). Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 12 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`. All **multi-chunk integration** or **global reasoning** is your responsibility here.\n- Return one **aggregated string** suitable for further supervisor inspection.\n\n\n\n## Relevant Pydantic Models\n\nThe following models are already in the global scope. **Do NOT redefine or re-import them.**\n\n### JobManifest Model\n```\nclass JobManifest(BaseModel):\n    chunk: str  # the actual text for the chunk of the document\n    task: str  # the actual task instruction for the small model\n    advice: str  # optional, any additional advice on how to perform the task\n\n    chunk_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    task_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    job_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n\n```\n\n### JobOutput Model\n```\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    citation: Optional[str]\n    answer: Optional[str]\n\n```\n\n## Function Signatures\n```\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        context (List[str]): A list of documents.

If we are unable to obtain the required authorizations before the expiry of the longstop dates set by the U.K.\nregulators under the Temporary Permissions Regime, our European operations could lose their ability to offer services within the U.K. market, or into the U.K.\nmarket on a cross-border basis. Our European operations may\n28\n\n\nTable of Contents\nalso be required to comply with legal and regulatory requirements in the U.K. that may be in addition to, or inconsistent with, those of the EEA, in each case,\nleading to increased complexity and costs.\nReal or perceived inaccuracies in our key metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.\nOur key metrics are calculated using internal company data based on the activity we measure on our payments platform and compiled from multiple systems,\nincluding systems that are internally developed or acquired through business combinations. While the measurement of our key metrics is based on what we\nbelieve to be reasonable methodologies and estimates, there are inherent challenges and limitations in measuring our key metrics globally at scale. The\nmethodologies used to calculate our key metrics require judgment.\nWe regularly review our processes for calculating these key metrics, and from time to time we may make adjustments to improve the accuracy or relevance of\nour metrics. For example, we continuously apply models, processes and practices designed to detect and prevent fraudulent account creation on our platforms,\nand work to improve and enhance those capabilities. When we detect a significant volume of illegitimate activity, we generally remove the activity identified\nfrom our key metrics. Although such adjustments may impact key metrics reported in prior periods, we generally do not update previously reported key metrics\nto reflect these subsequent adjustments unless the retrospective impact of process improvements or enhancements is determined by management to be material.\nFurth",

The strengthening or weakening of the United States\n(“U.S.”) dollar versus the British pound, Euro, Australian dollar, and Canadian dollar, as well as other currencies in which we conduct our international\noperations, impacts the translation of our net revenues and expenses generated in these foreign currencies into the U.S. dollar. In 2022, 2021, and 2020, we\ngenerated approximately 43%, 46%, and 49% of our net revenues from customers domiciled outside of the U.S., respectively. Because we generate substantial\nnet revenues internationally, we are subject to the risks of doing business outside of the U.S., including those discussed under “Item 1A.

The accounting estimates and\nassumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to our financial statements. An accounting estimate or assumption is\nconsidered critical if both (a) the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and (b) the impact\nwithin a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to our financial condition.

Certain jurisdictions where PayPal operates require us to hold eligible liquid assets, as defined by applicable\nregulatory requirements and commercial law in these jurisdictions, equal to at least 100% of the aggregate amount of all customer balances. Therefore, we\nrestrict the use of the assets underlying the customer balances to meet these regulatory requirements and separately classify the assets as customer accounts in\nour consolidated balance sheets. We classify the assets underlying the customer balances as current based on their purpose and availability to fulfill our direct\nobligation under amounts due to customers. Customer funds for which PayPal is an agent and custodian on behalf of our customers are not reflected on our\nconsolidated balance sheets.

During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, an additional $1.1 billion was approved to fund our credit activities. As of December 31, 2022, the cumulative amount approved by\nmanagement to be designated to fund credit activities aggregated to $3.8 billion and represented approximately 37% of European customer balances made\navailable for our corporate use at that date as determined by applying financial regulations maintained by the CSSF. At the time PayPal’s management\ndesignates the European customer balances held in our Luxembourg banking subsidiary to be used to extend credit, the balances are classified as cash and cash\nequivalents and no longer classified as customer accounts on our consolidated balance sheets.

The categorization within the following three-level fair value\nhierarchy for our recurring and non-recurring fair value measurements is based upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value\nmeasurement:\n•\nLevel 1 - Observable inputs, such as unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n•\nLevel 2 - Observable inputs other than Level 1 quoted prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are\nnot active or other inputs that are observable or can be market-corroborated.\n•\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs that cannot be directly corroborated by observable market data and that typically reflect management’s estimate of\nassumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.\nSee “Note 9—Fair Value Measurement of Assets and Liabilities” for additional information related to our fair value measurements.\nCrypto asset safeguarding liability and corresponding safeguarding asset\nSee “Note 7—Other Financial Statement Details” for information related to our crypto asset safeguarding liability and corresponding safeguarding asset.\n75\n\n\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nConcentrations of risk\nOur cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, loans and interest receivable, net, funds receivable and customer accounts, long-term\ninvestments, and long-term notes receivable, are potentially subject to concentration of credit risk.

Incentives that are determined to be\nconsideration payable to a customer or paid on behalf of a customer are recognized as a reduction of revenue. Certain incentives paid to users that are not our\ncustomers are classified as sales and marketing expense.\nWe provide merchants and consumers with protection programs for certain transactions completed on our payments platform. These programs are intended to\nprotect both merchants and consumers from loss primarily due to fraud and counterparty performance. These protection programs do not provide a separate\nservice to our customers and we estimate and record associated costs in transaction and credit losses during the period the payment transaction is completed.\nREVENUES FROM OTHER VALUE ADDED SERVICES\nWe earn revenues from other value added services, which are comprised primarily of revenue earned through partnerships, referral fees, subscription fees,\ngate",

However, given the number of years remaining subject to examination and the number of matters being examined, we\nare unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits.\nIn connection with our separation from eBay in 2015, we entered into various agreements that govern the relationship between the parties going forward,\nincluding a tax matters agreement. Under the tax matters agreement, eBay is generally responsible for all additional taxes (and will be entitled to all related\nrefunds of taxes) imposed on eBay and its subsidiaries (including subsidiaries that were transferred to PayPal pursuant to the separation) arising after the\nseparation date with respect to the taxable periods (or portions thereof) ended on or prior to July 17, 2015, except for those taxes for which PayPal has reflected\nan unrecognized tax benefit in its financial statements on the separation date.\n119\n\n\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nNOTE 17—RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES\nDuring the first quarter of 2022, management initiated a strategic reduction of the existing global workforce intended to streamline and optimize our global\noperations to enhance operating efficiency. This effort focused on reducing redundant operations and simplifying our organizational structure. The associated\nrestructuring charges in 2022 were $121 million. We primarily incurred employee severance and benefits costs, as well as associated consulting costs under the\n2022 strategic reduction. The strategic actions associated with this plan were substantially completed by the fourth quarter of 2022.\nThe following table summarizes the restructuring reserve activity during the year ended December 31, 2022:\n \nEmployee Severance and Benefits\nand Other Associated Costs\n(In millions)\nAccrued liability as of January 1, 2022\n$\n5 \nCharges\n121 \nPayments\n(102)\nAccrued liability as of December 31, 2022\n$\n24 \nDuring the first quarter of 2020, management approved a strategic reduction of the existing global workforce as part of a multiphase process to reorganize our\nworkforce concurrently with the redesign of our operating structure, which spanned multiple quarters. The associated restructuring charges in 2021 and 2020\nwere $27 million, and $109 million, respectively. We primarily incurred employee severance and benefits costs, as well as associated consulting costs under the\n2020 strategic reduction, which was substantially completed in 2021.\nAdditionally, we are continuing to review our real estate and facility capacity requirements due to our new and evolving work models. We incurred asset\nimpairment charges of $81 million, $26 million, and $30 million in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, due to exiting of certain leased properties which\nresulted in a reduction of ROU lease assets an",

      "output": "Based on the collected outputs, we have gathered some information about PayPal's current assets and liabilities, but it is fragmented and lacks specific figures necessary for a precise calculation of working capital.\n\n1. **Current Assets**: The outputs do not provide explicit figures for current assets. There are mentions of cash, cash equivalents, and receivables, but no consolidated total is given. The information suggests that these details might be found in the consolidated financial statements, which are not directly quoted in the outputs.\n\n2. **Current Liabilities**: We have some figures for current liabilities, such as accounts payable, funds payable, amounts due to customers, and accrued expenses. For example, total current liabilities are mentioned as \\$45,101 million for 2022. However, the breakdown and context are not fully clear.\n\n3. **Sufficiency**: The information is insufficient to definitively answer whether PayPal has positive working capital. We lack a clear total for current assets, which is necessary to compare against the current liabilities.\n\n4. **Missing Information**: We need explicit figures for PayPal's total current assets for FY2022. This would allow us to calculate working capital by subtracting total current liabilities from total current assets.\n\n5. **Calculation**: If we had the total current assets, we could calculate working capital as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Working Capital} = \\text{Total Current Assets} - \\text{Total Current Liabilities}\n   \\]\n   A positive result would indicate positive working capital.\n\n6. **Conflicting Information**: There are no direct conflicts in the outputs, but the lack of explicit data on current assets is a significant gap.\n\nIn conclusion, to answer the question, we need to access the consolidated financial statements to extract the total current assets for FY2022. Without this, we cannot determine if PayPal has positive working capital."

The PayPal Working Capital product allows businesses to access a loan or cash\nadvance for a fixed fee and based on their annual payment volume processed by PayPal. The PayPal Business Loan product provides businesses with short-\nterm financing for a fixed fee based on an evaluation of both the applying business as well as the business owner. In the United States (“U.S.”), these products\nare provided under a program agreement with an independent chartered financial institution. We believe that our merchant finance offerings enable us to\ndeepen our engagement with our existing small and medium-sized merchants and expand services to new merchants by providing access to capital that may not\nbe available from traditional banks or other lending providers.\nWe generate revenues from merchants primarily by charging fees for completing their payment transactions and other payment-related services. We also earn\nrevenues from interest and fees earned on our merchant loans receivables.\nConsumer value proposition\nWe focus on providing affordable, convenient, and secure consumer financial products and services intended to democratize the management and movement of\nmoney. We provide consumers with a digital wallet that enables them to send payments to merchants more safely using a variety of funding sources, which\nmay include a bank account, a PayPal or Venmo account balance, our consumer credit products, a credit card, a debit card, certain cryptocurrencies, or other\nstored value products such as gift cards, and eligible rewards. Our goal is to create the simplest checkout experience possible for consumers both online and on\nmobile devices.\nWe also offer consumers P2P payment solutions through our PayPal, Venmo, and Xoom products and services. We enable both domestic and international P2P\ntransfers across our payments platform. Our Venmo digital wallet in the U.S. is a leading mobile application used to move money between our customers and to\nmake purchases at select merchants. Our Xoom international mon",

In addition to administering an annual survey to gather\ninput from our global workforce, we also conducted specific surveys to gather direct employee feedback on our internal communications approach and\nevolving workplace preferences. For our 2022 annual employee survey, we heard from 83% of our global employees. Our engagement score, which reflects\nemployees that would recommend PayPal to their peers and/or are happy at PayPal was 79%. Our score measuring intent to stay was 78%, which reflects an\nemployee’s expectation to remain employed with the company in two years. Additionally, we observed improvements in employee scores regarding\ncollaboration and manager support. In 2022, we enhanced our survey to incorporate viewpoints on the employee experience, diversity, inclusion, equity, and\nbelonging (“DIE&B”) efforts, and our leadership principles, including specific questions on working style and strategic direction. The detailed scores are\nshared across the organization and analyzed to understand differences by geography, demographics, business function, and job level, and to help identify\nopportunities for further improvement.\nTalent acquisition, development, and retention\nAs a leading technology platform that enables digital payments and simplifies commerce experiences, we compete for top global talent around the world. We\nbelieve that a strong culture focused on employee experiences that enables advancement, learning, and individual career insights is essential to the successful\nacquisition, development, and retention of diverse talent. Accordingly, we have implemented programs focused on inclusive hiring practices and extending our\ntalent pipeline through targeted partnerships, reimagined our career development program for individuals and managers, extended individual coaching and\nmentorship programs (particularly for underrepresented and technical talent), and advanced efforts for employees to grow through self-paced and community\nlearning experiences.\nEmployee wellness\nWe remain focused on promoting the holistic well-being of our employees, including resources, programs, and services to support our employees’ physical,\nmental, and financial wellness. In 2022, our initiatives included extending our Global Wellness Days for all employees to take time to rest and recharge,\nproviding resources, trainings, and workshops to foster emotional well-being, preserving workplace flexibility through Crisis Leave and other programs, and\nstrategically extending employee benefits to additional global markets. We also continued our efforts to strengthen employee financial wellness, including\noffering individual employee financial coaching, promoting the prioritization of employee financial health across the private sector through the Worker\nFinancial Wellness Initiative, and improving our internal measurement and evaluation approaches to identify targeted opportunities for further enhancements.\nThrough our global c",

As a result, we are exposed to the risk related to fluctuations in interest\nrate to the extent of our borrowings. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had ¥64.3 billion (approximately $491 million) and ¥11.3 billion (approximately\n$98 million), respectively, outstanding under these credit facilities.

Higher interest\nrates often lead to larger payment obligations by customers of our credit products to us, or to lenders under mortgage, credit card, and other consumer and\nmerchant loans, which may reduce our customers’ ability to remain current on their obligations to us and therefore lead to increased delinquencies, charge-offs,\nand allowances for loans and interest receivable, which could have an adverse effect on our net income (loss).\nFOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK\nWe have significant operations internationally that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound, Euro, Australian dollar, and Canadian\ndollar, which subject us to foreign currency exchange rate risk and may adversely impact our financial results. We transact in various foreign currencies and\nhave significant international revenues and costs. In addition, we charge our international subsidiaries for their use of intellectual property and technology and\nfor certain corporate services. Our cash flows, results of operations, and certain of our intercompany balances that are exposed to foreign currency exchange\nrate fluctuations may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses due to foreign currency fluctuations and related\nhedging activities. We are generally a net receiver of foreign currencies and therefore benefit from a weakening of the United States (“U.S.”) dollar, and are\nadversely affected by a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, relative to foreign currencies. We considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates\nand determined that it was reasonably possible that changes in exchange rates of 10% for all currencies could be experienced in the near term.\n54\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWe have a foreign currency exchange exposure management program designed to identify material foreign currency exposures, manage these exposures, and\nreduce the potential effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated cash flows and results of operations through the execution of foreign currency\nexchange contracts.

These foreign currency exchange contracts are accounted for as derivative instruments; for additional details related to our foreign currency\nexchange contracts, please see “Note 10—Derivative Instruments” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.\nWe use foreign currency exchange forward contracts to protect our forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent earnings and our investment in foreign subsidiaries from\nadverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These hedging contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of adverse foreign currency\nexchange rate movements. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted revenues denominated in foreign currencies and net investment\nhedges for accounting purposes.

Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal\ncontrol over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial\nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence\nregarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control\nover financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and\ntesting and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.

Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company’s\ninternal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board\n(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the\napplicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal\ncontrol over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial\nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence\nregarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control\nover financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and\ntesting and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other\nprocedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n59\n\n\nTable of Contents\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and\nthe preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

When\ncustomers fund their PayPal account using their bank account, credit card, debit card, or withdraw funds from their PayPal account to their bank account or\nthrough a debit card transaction, there is a clearing period before the cash is received or settled, usually one to three business days for U.S. transactions and\ngenerally up to five business days for international transactions. In addition, a portion of our customers’ funds are settled directly to their bank account. These\nfunds are also classified as funds receivable and funds payable and arise due to the time required to initiate collection from and clear transactions through\nexternal payment networks.\nProperty and equipment\nProperty and equipment consists primarily of computer equipment, software and website development costs, land and buildings, leasehold improvements, and\nfurniture and fixtures. Property and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are\ncomputed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets; generally, one to four years for computer equipment and software,\nincluding capitalized software and website development costs, three years for furniture and fixtures, up to 30 years for buildings and building improvements,\nand the shorter of five years or the non-cancelable term of the lease for leasehold improvements.\nDirect costs incurred to develop software for internal use and website development costs, including those costs incurred in expanding and enhancing our\npayments platform, are capitalized and amortized generally over an estimated useful life of three years and are recorded as amortization within the financial\nstatement captions aligned with the internal organizations that are the primary beneficiaries of such assets.

Online advertising expenses are recognized based on the terms of the individual\nagreements, which are generally over the greater of the ratio of the number of impressions delivered over the total number of contracted impressions, on a pay-\nper-click basis, or on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract.

Based on the information provided to and reviewed by our CODM, we\nbelieve that the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of our revenue and cash flows and how they are affected by economic factors are most appropriately\ndepicted through our primary geographical markets and types of revenue categories (transaction revenues and revenues from other value added services).\nRevenues recorded within these categories are earned from similar products and services for which the nature of associated fees and the related revenue\nrecognition models are substantially the same.\n79\n\n\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nThe following table presents our revenue disaggregated by primary geographical market and category:\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2022\n  \n2021\n2020\n(In millions)\nPrimary geographical markets\nU.S.\n$\n15,807 \n$\n13,712 \n$\n11,013 \nUnited Kingdom (“U.K.”)\n2,071 \n2,340 \n2,340 \nOther countries\n9,640 \n9,319 \n8,101 \nTotal net revenues\n$\n27,518 \n$\n25,371 \n$\n21,454 \nRevenue category\nTransaction revenues\n$\n25,206 \n$\n23,402 \n$\n19,918 \nRevenues from other value added services\n2,312 \n1,969 \n1,536 \nTotal net revenues\n$\n27,518 \n$\n25,371 \n$\n21,454 \nNo single country included in the other countries category generated more than 10% of total revenue.\nTotal net revenues include $1.3 billion, $425 million, and $597 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, which do not represent revenues recognized in the\nscope of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from contracts with customers.

Shares issued as a result of stock option exercises and the release of stock awards were funded primarily with the issuance of\nnew shares of common stock.\nIn 2022, the Company adopted a plan for which equity-based incentive awards may be granted to new employees (the “Inducement Plan”). Grants under the\nInducement Plan are in addition to the Plan mentioned above. As of December 31, 2",
