--- Question ---
Does AMD have a reasonably healthy liquidity profile based on its quick ratio for FY22? If the quick ratio is not relevant to measure liquidity, please state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
Based on the available information, AMD has a quick ratio of 1.07 for FY22, which suggests a reasonably healthy liquidity profile. However, the lack of consistent verification of the components used in the calculation means that this assessment should be taken with caution.

--- Ground Truth ---
['Yes. The quick ratio is 1.57, calculated as (cash and cash equivalents+Short term investments+Accounts receivable, net+receivables from related parties)/ (current liabilities).']
