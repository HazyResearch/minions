If gross margins are not a relevant metric for a company like this, then please state that and explain why.\n\n---\n\nPlease provide succinct advice on the critical information we need to extract from the Financial document. Total length: 1557432 characters to answer this question. \n\nAlso consider the following constraints:\n- In your response do NOT use numbered lists.\n- Do NOT structure your response as a sequence of steps.\n",
      "output": "To address the question about JPM's gross margins, it's important to first understand the nature of JPMorgan Chase & Co. as a financial institution. Gross margin is typically a metric used to assess the profitability of companies that produce goods, as it measures the difference between revenue and the cost of goods sold. For a financial services company like JPMorgan Chase, gross margin is not a relevant metric because their primary business activities involve financial transactions, interest income, and fees rather than the sale of physical goods.\n\nInstead, for a company like JPMorgan Chase, more relevant metrics would include net interest margin, return on assets, return on equity, and efficiency ratio. These metrics provide insights into the bank's profitability, operational efficiency, and overall financial health. Therefore, when reviewing the financial document, focus on these metrics rather than gross margins to assess the company's performance and consistency over time. Additionally, examining annual reports or financial statements for trends in these metrics will provide a clearer picture of JPM's financial stability and operational consistency."

The \nFederal Reserve has jointly issued guidance with the FDIC \nand the OCC that is designed to ensure that incentive \ncompensation paid by banking organizations does not \nencourage imprudent risk-taking that threatens the \norganizations’ safety and soundness. The Financial Stability \nBoard (“FSB”) has also established standards covering \ncompensation principles for banks. The Firm’s \ncompensation practices are also subject to regulation and \noversight by regulators in other jurisdictions, notably the \nFifth Capital Requirements Directive (“CRD V”), as \nimplemented in the EU and as adopted in the U.K, which \nincludes compensation-related provisions. The European \nBanking Authority has instituted guidelines on \ncompensation policies including under CRD V which in \ncertain countries, such as Germany, are implemented or \nsupplemented by local regulations or guidelines. The U.K. \nregulators have also instituted guidelines on CRD V \ncompensation policies. The Firm expects that the \nimplementation of regulatory guidelines regarding \ncompensation in the U.S. and other countries will continue \nto evolve, and may affect the manner in which the Firm \nstructures its compensation programs and practices.\nOther significant international regulatory initiatives: \nPolicymakers in the U.K. and EU continue to implement a \nprogram of regulatory enhancements relating to financial \nservices, several key elements of which are discussed \nbelow.\nMiFID II requires the trading of shares and certain \nstandardized OTC derivatives to take place on specified \ntrading venues. MiFID II also significantly enhanced \nrequirements for pre- and post-trade transparency, \ntransaction reporting and investor protection, and \nintroduced a position limits and reporting regime for \ncommodities. In November 2021, the European Commission \n(“EC”) published a draft legislative proposal for \namendments to MiFID II focused on changes to rules related \nto transparency and market structure, including the \nproposed creation of a consolidated tape intended to \nincrease transparency into trading across the EU by \nproviding a centralized source of market data. This \nlegislation remains subject to review by the European \nParliament and European Council. \nIn the U.K., MiFID II is being amended through the \n“Wholesale Markets Review”, a set of proposals designed to \nstreamline and improve regulation of the U.K. secondary \nmarkets following the U.K.’s departure from the EU.

JPMorgan Chase regularly monitors various \nsegments of its credit and market risk exposures to assess \nthe potential risks of concentration or contagion, but its \nability to diversify or hedge its exposure against those risks \nmay be limited.\nJPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses can also be harmed \nby an excessive expansion of consumer credit by bank or \nnon-bank competitors. Heightened competition for certain \ntypes of consumer loans could prompt industry-wide \nreactions such as significant reductions in the pricing or \nmargins of those loans or the making of loans to less-\ncreditworthy borrowers. If large numbers of consumers \nsubsequently default on their loans, whether due to weak \ncredit profiles, an economic downturn or other factors, this \ncould impair their ability to repay obligations owed to \nJPMorgan Chase and result in higher charge-offs and other \ncredit-related losses. More broadly, widespread defaults on \nconsumer debt could lead to recessionary conditions in the \nU.S. economy, and JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses \nmay earn lower revenues in such an environment.\nIf JPMorgan Chase is unable to reduce positions effectively \nduring a market dislocation, this can increase both the \nmarket and credit risks associated with those positions and \nthe level of risk-weighted-assets (“RWA”) that JPMorgan \nChase holds on its balance sheet. These factors could \nadversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s capital position, funding \ncosts and the profitability of its businesses.\nLiquidity\nJPMorgan Chase’s ability to operate its businesses could \nbe impaired if its liquidity is constrained. \nJPMorgan Chase’s liqui",

That presentation, which is \nreferred to as “reported” basis, provides the reader with an \nunderstanding of the Firm’s results that can be tracked \nconsistently from year-to-year and enables a comparison of \nthe Firm’s performance with the U.S. GAAP financial \nstatements of other companies.\nIn addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported \nbasis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the \noverhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide \nmanaged basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. \nThe Firm also reviews the results of the LOBs on a managed \nbasis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each \ncase, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes \ncertain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the \nFirm (and each of the reportable business segments) on an \nFTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that \nreceive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in \nthe managed results on a basis comparable to taxable \ninvestments and securities. These financial measures allow \nmanagement to assess the comparability of revenue from \nyear-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt \nsources. The corresponding income tax impact related to \ntax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. \nThese adjustments have no impact on net income as \nreported by the Firm as a whole or by the LOBs.\nManagement also uses certain non-GAAP financial \nmeasures at the Firm and business-segment level because \nthese other non-GAAP financial measures provide \ninformation to investors about the underlying operational \nperformance and trends of the Firm or of the particular \nbusiness segment, as the case may be, and therefore \nfacilitate a comparison of the Firm or the business segment \nwith the performance of its relevant competitors. Refer to \nBusiness Segment Results on pages 61-80 for additional \ninformation on these non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP \nfinancial measures used by the Firm may not be \ncomparable to similarly named non-GAAP financial \nmeasures used by other companies. \nThe following summary table provides a reconciliation from the Firm’s reported U.S. GAAP results to managed basis.\n2022\n2021\n2020\nYear ended \nDecember 31, \n(in millions, except ratios)\nReported\nFully taxable-\nequivalent \nadjustments(a)\nManaged\nbasis\nReported\nFully taxable-\nequivalent \nadjustments(a)\nManaged\nbasis\nReported\nFully taxable-\nequivalent \nadjustments(a)\nManaged\nbasis\nOther income\n$ 4,322 \n$ \n3,148 \n$ 7,470 \n$ 4",

Revenue is generally \nrecognized in the segment responsible for the related \nproduct or service, with allocations to the other segment(s) \ninvolved in the transaction. The segment results reflect \nthese revenue-sharing agreements.\nExpense Allocation\nWhere business segments use services provided by \ncorporate support units, or another business segment, the \ncosts of those services are allocated to the respective \nbusiness segments. The expense is generally \nallocated based on the actual cost and use of services \nprovided. In contrast, certain costs and investments related \nto corporate support units, technology and operations that \nare not currently utilized by any LOB, are not allocated to \nthe business segments and are retained in Corporate. \nExpense retained in Corporate generally includes costs that \nwould not be incurred if the segments were stand-alone \nbusinesses, and other items not aligned with a particular \nbusiness segment.\nFunds transfer pricing \nFunds transfer pricing (“FTP”) is the process by which the \nFirm allocates interest income and expense to the LOBs and \nOther Corporate and transfers the primary interest rate risk \nand liquidity risk to Treasury and CIO.\nThe funds transfer pricing process considers the interest \nrate and liquidity risk characteristics of assets and liabilities \nand off-balance sheet products. Periodically, the \nmethodology and assumptions utilized in the FTP process \nare adjusted to reflect economic conditions and other \nfactors, which may impact the allocation of net interest \nincome to the segments.\nAs a result of the rising interest rate environment, the cost \nof funds for assets and the credits earned for liabilities have \ngenerally increased, impacting the business segments’ net \ninterest income. During the period ended December 31, \n2022, this has resulted in higher cost of funds for loans and \ncontributed to margin expansion on deposits.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\n61\n\n\nForeign exchange risk\nForeign exchange risk is transferred from the LOBs and \nOther Corporate to Treasury and CIO for certain revenues \nand expenses. Treasury and CIO manages these risks \ncentrally and reports the impact of foreign exchange rate \nmovements related to the transferred risk in its results. \nRefer to Market Risk Management on page 137 for \nadditional information.\nDebt expense and preferred stock dividend allocation\nAs part of the funds transfer pricing process, almost all of \nthe cost of the credit spread component of outstanding \nunsecured long-term debt and preferred stock dividends is \nallocated to the reportable business segments, while the \nbalance of the cost is retained in Corporate. The \nmethodology to allocate the cost of unsecured long-term \ndebt and preferred stock dividends to the business \nsegments is aligned with the relevant regulatory capital \nrequirements and funding needs of the LOBs, as applicable",

Markets includes both \nFixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Markets revenue \nconsists of principal transactions, fees, commissions and \nother income, as well as net interest income. The Firm \nassesses its Markets business performance on a total \nrevenue basis, as offsets may occur across revenue line \nitems. For example, securities that generate net interest \nincome may be risk-managed by derivatives that are \nreflected at fair value in principal transactions revenue. \nRefer to Notes 6 and 7 for a description of the composition \nof these income statement line items. \nPrincipal transactions reflects revenue on financial \ninstruments and commodities transactions that arise from \nclient-driven market-making activity. Principal transactions \nrevenue includes amounts recognized upon executing new \ntransactions with market participants, as well as “inventory-\nrelated revenue”, which is revenue recognized from gains \nand losses on derivatives and other instruments that the \nFirm has been holding in anticipation of, or in response to, \nclient demand, and changes in the fair value of instruments \nused by the Firm to actively manage the risk exposure \narising from such inventory. Principal transactions revenue \nrecognized upon executing new transactions with market \nparticipants is affected by many factors including the level \nof client activity, the bid-offer spread (which is the \ndifference between the price at which a market participant \nis willing and able to sell an instrument to the Firm and the \nprice at which another market participant is willing and able \nto buy it from the Firm, and vice versa), market liquidity \nand volatility. These factors are interrelated and sensitive \nto the same factors that drive inventory-related revenue, \nwhich include general market conditions, such as interest \nrates, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads, and equity \nand commodity prices, as well as other macroeconomic \nconditions.  \nManagement’s discussion and analysis\n70\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\n\n\nFor the periods presented below, the predominant source of principal transactions revenue was the amount recognized upon \nexecuting new transactions.\n2022\n2021\n2020\nYear ended December 31, \n(in millions, except where \notherwise noted)\nFixed \nIncome \nMarkets\nEquity \nMarkets\nTotal \nMarkets\nFixed \nIncome \nMarkets\nEquity \nMarkets\nTotal \nMarkets\nFixed \nIncome \nMarkets\nEquity \nMarkets\nTotal \nMarkets\nPrincipal transactions\n$ 11,682 $ \n8,846 $ 20,528 \n$ \n7,911 $ \n7,519 $ 15,430 \n$ 11,857 $ \n6,087 $ 17,944 \nLending- and deposit-related fees\n \n303  \n22  \n325 \n \n321  \n17  \n338 \n \n226  \n10  \n236 \nAsset management, \nadministration and com",

The impact of risk and control issues is carefully \nconsidered in the Firm’s performance evaluation and \nincentive compensation processes. \nRisk governance framework\nThe Firm’s risk governance framework involves \nunderstanding drivers of risks, types of risks, and impacts of \nrisks. \nDrivers of risks are factors that cause a risk to exist.

Operational risk \nincludes compliance, conduct, legal, and estimations and \nmodel risk.\nImpacts of risks are consequences of risks, both quantitative \nand qualitative.

In addition to CCAR and \nother periodic stress testing, management also considers \ntailored stress scenarios and sensitivity analyses, as \nnecessary. \nContingency Capital Plan\nThe Firm’s Contingency Capital Plan establishes the capital \nmanagement framework for the Firm and specifies the \nprinciples underlying the Firm’s approach towards capital \nmanagement in normal economic conditions and in stressed \nenvironments. The Contingency Capital Plan defines how \nthe Firm calibrates its targeted capital levels and meets \nminimum capital requirements, monitors the ongoing \nappropriateness of planned capital distributions, and sets \nout the capital contingency actions that are expected to be \ntaken or considered at various levels of capital depletion \nduring a period of stress.\nRegulatory capital\nThe Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements, \nincluding well-capitalized standards, for the consolidated \nfinancial holding company. The OCC establishes similar \nminimum capital requirements and standards for the Firm’s \nIDI subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The \nU.S. capital requirements generally follow the Capital \nAccord of the Basel Committee, as amended from time to \ntime.\nBasel III Overview\nThe capital rules under Basel III establish minimum capital \nratios and overall capital adequacy standards for large and \ninternationally active U.S. BHCs and banks, including the \nFirm",

The minimum amount of regulatory capital that \nmust be held by BHCs and banks is determined by \ncalculating RWA, which are on-balance sheet assets and off-\nbalance sheet exposures, weighted according to risk. Two \ncomprehensive approaches are prescribed for calculating \nRWA: a standardized approach (“Basel III Standardized”), \nand an advanced approach (“Basel III Advanced”). For each \nof the risk-based capital ratios, the capital adequacy of the \nFirm is evaluated against the lower of the Standardized or \nAdvanced approaches compared to their respective \nregulatory capital ratio requirements. The Firm’s Basel III \nStandardized risk-based ratios are currently more binding \nthan the Basel III Advanced risk-based ratios.\nBasel III establishes capital requirements for calculating \ncredit risk RWA and market risk RWA, and in the case of \nBasel III Advanced, operational risk RWA. Key differences in \nthe calculation of credit risk RWA between the Standardized \nand Advanced approaches are that for Basel III Advanced, \ncredit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive approaches which \nlargely rely on the use of internal credit models and \nparameters, whereas for Basel III Standardized, credit risk \nRWA is generally based on supervisory risk-weightings \nwhich vary primarily by counterparty type and asset class. \nMarket risk RWA is calculated on a generally consistent \nbasis between Basel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced. \nIn addition to the RWA calculated under these approaches, \nthe Firm may supplement such amounts to incorporate \nmanagement judgment and feedback from its regulators. \nBasel III also includes a requirement for Advanced \nApproaches banking organizations, including the Firm, to \ncalculate the SLR.

The capital conservation \nbuffer incorporates a GSIB surcharge, a discretionary \ncountercyclical capital buffer and a fixed capital \nconservation buffer of 2.5% for Advanced regulatory \ncapital requirements and a variable SCB requirement, \nfloored at 2.5%, for Standardized regulatory capital \nrequirements. \nUnder the Federal Reserve’s GSIB rule, the Firm is required \nto assess its GSIB surcharge on an annual basis under two \nseparately prescribed methods based on data for the \nprevious fiscal year-end, and is subject to the higher of the \ntwo. “Method 1” reflects the GSIB surcharge as prescribed \nby the Basel Committee’s assessment methodology, and is \ncalculated by the Financial Stability Board (“FSB”) across \nfive criteria: size, cross-jurisdictional activity, \ninterconnectedness, complexity and substitutability. \n“Method 2”, calculated by the Firm, modifies the Method 1 \nrequirements to include a measure of short-term wholesale \nfunding in place of substitutability, and introduces a GSIB \nscore “multiplication factor”. \nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\n89\n\n\nThe following table presents the Firm’s effective GSIB \nsurcharge for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 \nand 2021.

Methodologies for measuring credit \nrisk vary depending on several factors, including type of \nasset (e.g., consumer versus wholesale), risk measurement \nparameters (e.g., delinquency status and borrower’s credit \nscore versus wholesale risk-rating) and risk management \nand collection processes (e.g., retail collection center \nversus centrally managed workout groups). Credit risk \nmeasurement is based on the probability of default of an \nobligor or counterparty, the loss severity given a default \nevent and the exposure at default.\nBased on these factors and the methodology and estimates \ndescribed in Note 13 and Note 10, the Firm estimates credit \nlosses for its exposures. The allowance for loan losses \nreflects estimated credit losses related to the consumer and \nwholesale held-for-investment loan portfolios, the \nallowance for lending-related commitments reflects \nestimated credit losses related to the Firm’s lending-related \ncommitments and the allowance for investment securities \nreflects estimated credit losses related to the investment \nsecurities portfolio.

Total criticized exposure, excluding loans held-for-sale \nand loans at fair value, was $31.3 billion at December 31, 2022 and $38.2 billion at December 31, 2021, representing \napproximately 2.7% and 3.5% of total wholesale credit exposure, respectively. Criticized exposure decreased driven by net \nportfolio activity and client-specific upgrades concentrated in Consumer & Retail, Technology, Media & Telecommunications \nand Real Estate, largely offset by client-specific downgrades. Of the $31.3 billion of criticized exposure at December 31, 2022, \napproximately half was undrawn and $28.6 billion was performing.\nThe table below summarizes by industry the Firm’s exposures as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.

Most of these commitments and \nguarantees have historically been refinanced, extended, \ncancelled, or expired without being drawn upon or a default \noccurring. As a result, the Firm does not believe that the \ntotal contractual amount of these wholesale lending-related \ncommitments is representative of the Firm’s expected \nfuture credit exposure or funding requirements. Refer to \nNote 28 for further information on wholesale lending-\nrelated commitments.\nReceivables from customers\nReceivables from customers reflect held-for-investment \nmargin loans to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM that \nare collateralized by assets maintained in the clients’ \nbrokerage accounts (e.g., cash on deposit, and liquid and \nreadily marketable debt or equity securities). Because of \nthis collateralization, no allowance for credit losses is \ngenerally held against these receivables. To manage its \ncredit risk, the Firm establishes margin requirements and \nmonitors the required margin levels on an ongoing basis, \nand requires clients to deposit additional cash or other \ncollateral, or to reduce positions, when appropriate. These \nreceivables are reported within accrued interest and \naccounts receivable on the Firm’s Consolidated balance \nsheets.\nDerivative contracts\nDerivatives enable clients and counterparties to manage \nrisk, including credit risk and risks arising from fluctuations \nin interest rates, foreign exchange and equities and \ncommodities prices. The Firm makes markets in derivatives \nin order to meet these needs and uses derivatives to \nmanage certain risks associated with net open risk positions \nfrom its market-making activities, including the \ncounterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables. \nThe Firm also uses derivative instruments to manage its own \ncredit risk and other market risk exposure. The nature of the \ncounterparty and the settlement mechanism of the \nderivative affect the credit risk to which the Firm is exposed. \nFor OTC derivatives, the Firm is exposed to the credit risk of \nthe derivative counterparty. For exchange-traded \nderivatives (“ETD”), such as futures and options, and \ncleared over-the-counter (“OTC-cleared”) derivatives, the \nFirm can also be exposed to the credit risk of the relevant \nCCP. Where possible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its credit \nrisk exposures arising from derivative contracts through the \nuse of legally enforceable master netting arrangements and \ncollateral agreements. The percentage of the Firm’s OTC \nderivative transactions subject to collateral agreements — \nexcluding foreign exchange spot trades, which are not \ntypically covered by collateral agreements due to their short \nmaturity and centrally cleared trades that are settled daily — \nwas approximately 87% and 88% at December 31, 2022 \nand 2021, respectively.

Refer to Note 5 for additional \ninformation on the Firm’s use of collateral agreements and \nfurther discussion of derivative contracts, counterparties \nand settlement types.\nThe fair value of derivative receivables reported on the \nConsolidated balance sheets were $70.9 billion and $57.1 \nbillion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The \nincrease was primarily driven by higher foreign exchange as \na result of market movements. Derivative receivables \nrepresent the fair value of the derivative contracts after \ngiving effect to legally enforceable master netting \nagreements and the related cash collateral held by the \nFirm.\nIn addition, the Firm held liquid securities and other cash \ncollateral that may be used as security when the fair value \nof the client’s exposure is in the Firm’s favor. For these \npurposes, the definition of liquid securities is consistent with \nthe definition of high quality liquid assets as defined in the \nLCR rule.\nIn management’s view, the appropriate measure of current \ncredit risk should also take into consideration other \ncollateral, which generally represents securities that do not \nqualify as high quality liquid assets under the LCR rule. The \nbenefits of these additional collateral amounts for each \ncounterparty are subject to a legally enforceable master \nnetting agreement and limited to the net amount of the \nderivative receivables for each counterparty.\nThe Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily cash, G7 \ngovernment securities, other liquid government agency and \nguaranteed securities, and corporate debt and equity \nsecurities) delivered by clients at the initiation of \ntransactions, as well as collateral related to contracts that \nhave a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the Firm \nhas agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the \nreporting date.

To \ncapture the potential future variability of credit exposure, \nthe Firm calculates, on a client-by-client basis, three \nmeasures of potential derivatives-related credit loss: Peak, \nDerivative Risk Equivalent (“DRE”), and Average exposure \n(“AVG”). These measures all incorporate netting and \ncollateral benefits, where applicable.\nPeak represents a conservative measure of potential \nderivative exposure, including the benefit of collateral, to a \ncounterparty calculated in a manner that is broadly \nequivalent to a 97.5% confidence level over the life of the \ntransaction. Peak is the primary measure used by the Firm \nfor setting credit limits for derivative contracts, senior \nmanagement reporting and derivatives exposure \nmanagement.\nDRE exposure is a measure that expresses the risk of \nderivative exposure, including the benefit of collateral, on a \nbasis intended to be equivalent to the risk of loan \nexposures. DRE is a less extreme measure of potential \ncredit loss than Peak and is used as an input for \naggregating derivative credit risk exposures with loans and \nother credit risk.\nFinally, AVG is a measure of the expected fair value of the \nFirm’s derivative exposure, including the benefit of \ncollateral, at future time periods. AVG over the total life of \nthe derivative contract is used as the primary metric for \npricing purposes and is used to calculate credit risk capital \nand CVA, as further described below. \nThe fair value of the Firm’s derivative receivables \nincorporates CVA to reflect the credit quality of \ncounterparties. CVA is based on the Firm’s AVG to a \ncounterparty and the counterparty’s credit spread in the \ncredit derivatives market. The Firm believes that active risk \nmanagement is essential to controlling the dynamic credit \nrisk in the derivatives portfolio. In addition, the Firm’s risk \nmanagement process for derivatives exposures takes into \nconsideration the potential impact of wrong-way risk, which \nis broadly defined as the risk that exposure to a \ncounterparty is positively correlated with the impact of a \ndefault by the same counterparty, which could cause \nexposure to increase at the same time as the counterparty’s \ncapacity to meet its obligations is decreasing. Many factors \nmay influence the nature and magnitude of these \ncorrelations over time. To the extent that these correlations \nare identified, the Firm may adjust the CVA associated with \na particular counterparty’s AVG. The Firm risk manages \nexposure to changes in CVA by entering into credit \nderivative contracts, as well as interest rate, foreign \nexchange, equity and commodity derivative co",

The Firm’s allowance for \ncredit losses comprises:\n• the allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s \nretained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated) and is \npresented separately on the Consolidated balance sheets,\n• the allowance for lending-related commitments, which is \nreflected in accounts payable and other liabilities on the \nConsolidated balance sheets, and\n• the allowance for credit losses on investment securities, \nwhich is reflected in investment securities on the \nConsolidated balance sheets.\nDiscussion of changes in the allowance\nThe allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2022 \nwas $22.2 billion, reflecting a net addition of $3.5 billion \nfrom December 31, 2021, consisting of: \n• $2.3 billion in wholesale, driven by deterioration in the \nFirm’s macroeconomic outlook and loan growth, \npredominantly in CB and CIB, and\n• $1.2 billion in consumer, predominantly driven by Card \nServices, reflecting higher outstanding balances and \ndeterioration in the Firm’s macroeconomic outlook, \npartially offset by a reduction in the allowance related to \na decrease in uncertainty associated with borrower \nbehavior as the effects of the pandemic gradually recede. \nDeterioration in the Firm’s macroeconomic outlook included \nboth updates to the central scenario in the fourth quarter of \n2022, which now reflects a mild recession, as well as the \nimpact of the increased weight placed on the adverse \nscenarios beginning in the first quarter of 2022 due to the \neffects associated with higher inflation, changes in \nmonetary policy, and geopolitical risks, including the war in \nUkraine. \nThe Firm's allowance for credit losses is estimated using a \nweighted average of five internally developed \nmacroeconomic scenarios.

The Firm \nhas a single VaR framework used as a basis for calculating \nRisk Management VaR and Regulatory VaR.\nThe framework is employed across the Firm using historical \nsimulation based on data for the previous 12 months. The \nframework’s approach assumes that historical changes in \nmarket values are representative of the distribution of \npotential outcomes in the immediate future. The Firm \nbelieves the use of Risk Management VaR provides a daily \nmeasure of risk that is closely aligned to risk management \ndecisions made by the LOBs and Corporate and, along with \nother market risk measures, provides the appropriate \ninformation needed to respond to risk events. \nThe Firm’s Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming a \none-day holding period and an expected tail-loss \nmethodology which approximates a 95% confidence level. \nRisk Management VaR provides a consistent framework to \nmeasure risk profiles and levels of diversification across \nproduct types and is used for aggregating risks and \nmonitoring limits across businesses. VaR results are \nreported to senior management, the Board of Directors and \nregulators.  \nUnderlying the overall VaR model framework are individual \nVaR models that simulate historical market returns for \nindividual risk factors and/or product types. To capture \nmaterial market risks as part of the Firm’s risk management \nframework, comprehensive VaR model calculations are \nperformed daily for businesses whose activities give rise to \nmarket risk.

The VaR model \nresults across all portfolios are aggregated at the Firm \nlevel.\nAs VaR is based on historical data, it is an imperfect \nmeasure of market risk exposure and potential future \nlosses. In addition, based on their reliance on available \nhistorical data, limited time horizons, and other factors, \nVaR measures are inherently limited in their ability to \nmeasure certain risks and to predict losses, particularly \nthose associated with market illiquidity and sudden or \nsevere shifts in market conditions. \nFor certain products, specific risk parameters are not \ncaptured in VaR due to the lack of liquidity and availability \nof appropriate historical data. The Firm uses proxies to \nestimate the VaR for these and other products when daily \ntime series are not available. It is likely that using an actual \nprice-based time series for these products, if available, \nwould affect the VaR results presented. The Firm therefore \nconsiders other nonstatistical measures such as stress \ntesting, in addition to VaR, to capture and manage its \nmarket risk positions. \nThe daily market data used in VaR models may be different \nthan the independent third-party data collected for VCG \nprice testing in its monthly valuation process. For example, \nin cases where market prices are not observable, or where \nproxies are used in VaR historical time series, the data \nsources may differ.

As VaR \nmodel calculations require daily data and a consistent \nsource for valuation, it may not be practical to use the data \ncollected in the VCG monthly valuation process for VaR \nmodel calculations. \nThe Firm’s VaR model calculations are periodically \nevaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the \ncomposition of the Firm’s portfolios, changes in market \nconditions, improvements in the Firm’s modeling \ntechniques and measurements, and other factors.

The \nFirm’s most complex accounting estimates require \nmanagement’s judgment to ascertain the appropriate \ncarrying value of assets and liabilities. The Firm has \nestablished policies and control procedures intended to \nensure that estimation methods, including any judgments \nmade as part of such methods, are well-controlled, \nindependently reviewed and applied consistently from \nperiod to period. The methods used and judgments made \nreflect, among other factors, the nature of the assets or \nliabilities and the related business and risk management \nstrategies, which may vary across the Firm’s businesses and \nportfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures are \nintended to ensure that the process for changing \nmethodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The Firm \nbelieves its estimates for determining the carrying value of \nits assets and liabilities are appropriate. The following is a \nbrief description of the Firm’s critical accounting estimates \ninvolving significant judgments.\nAllowance for credit losses\nThe Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents \nmanagement’s estimate of expected credit losses over the \nremaining expected life of the Firm’s financial assets \nmeasured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet \nlending-related commitments. The allowance for credit \nlosses comprises:\n• The allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s \nretained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated),\n• The allowance for lending-related commitments, and\n• The allowance for credit losses on investment securities.\nThe allowance for credit losses involves significant \njudgment on a number of matters including development \nand weighting of macroeconomic forecasts, incorporation of \nhistorical loss experience, assessment of risk \ncharacteristics, assignment of risk ratings, valuation of \ncollateral, and the determination of remaining expected \nlife. Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 for further information \non these judgments as well as the Firm’s policies and \nmethodologies used to determine the Firm’s allowance for \ncredit losses.\nOne of the most significant judgments involved in \nestimating the Firm’s allowance for credit losses relates to \nthe macroeconomic forecasts used to estimate credit losses \nover the eight-quarter forecast period within the Firm’s \nmethodology. The eight-quarter forecast incorporates \nhundreds of macroeconomic variables (“MEVs”) that are \nrelevant for exposures across the Firm, with modeled credit \nlosses being driven primarily by a subset of less than twenty \nvariables. The specific variables that have the greatest \neffect on the modeled losses of each portfolio vary by \nportfolio and geography.\n• Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio include regional U.S. \nunemployment",

Changes in the factors and inputs considered may \nnot occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across \nall geographies or product types, and changes in factors \nand inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such that \nimprovement in one factor or input may offset deterioration \nin others.\nTo consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate \nmacroeconomic forecast, the Firm compared the modeled \ncredit losses determined using its central and relative \nadverse macroeconomic scenarios, which are two of the five \nscenarios considered in estimating the allowances for loan \nlosses and lending-related commitments. The central and \nrelative adverse scenarios each included a full suite of \nMEVs, but differed in the levels, paths and peaks/troughs of \nthose variables over the eight-quarter forecast period.  \nFor example, compared to the Firm’s central scenario \nshown on page 127 and in Note 13, the Firm’s relative \nadverse scenario assumes an elevated U.S. unemployment \nrate, averaging approximately 1.9% higher over the eight-\nquarter forecast, with a peak difference of approximately \n2.8% in the fourth quarter of 2023; lower U.S. real GDP \nwith a slower recovery, remaining nearly 3.1% lower at the \nend of the eight-quarter forecast, with a peak difference of \napproximately 3.9% in the fourth quarter of 2023; and \nlower national HPI with a peak difference of approximately \n8.4% in the third quarter of 2024.\nThis analysis is not intended to estimate expected future \nchanges in the allowance for credit losses, for a number of \nreasons, including:\n• The allowance as of December 31, 2022, reflects credit \nlosses beyond those estimated under the central scenario \ndue to the weight placed on the adverse scenarios.\n• The impacts of changes in many MEVs are both \ninterrelated and nonlinear, so the results of this analysis \ncannot be simply extrapolated for more severe changes \nin macroeconomic variables. \n• Expectations of future changes in portfolio composition \nand borrower behavior can significantly affect the \nallowance for credit losses.\nTo demonstrate the sensitivity of credit loss estimates to \nmacroeconomic forecasts as of December 31, 2022, the \nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\n149\n\n\nFirm c",

Second, the lack of observability of certain significant \ninputs requires management to assess relevant empirical \ndata in deriving valuation inputs including, for example, \ntransaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment \nspeed, default rates, volatilities, correlations, prices (such \nas commodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of \ncomparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit \ncurves. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of the \nvaluation of level 3 instruments, including unobservable \ninputs used.\nFor instruments classified in levels 2 and 3, management \njudgment must be applied to assess the appropriate level of \nvaluation adjustments to reflect counterparty credit quality, \nthe Firm’s creditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity \nconsiderations, unobservable parameters, and for portfolios \nthat meet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk \nposition. The judgments made are typically affected by the \ntype of product and its specific contractual terms, and the \nlevel of liquidity for the product or within the market as a \nwhole. In periods of heightened market volatility and \nuncertainty judgments are further affected by the wider \nvariation of reasonable valuation estimates, particularly for \npositions that are less liquid.

The Firm \nmaintains a rewards liability which represents the \nestimated cost of rewards points earned and expected to be \nredeemed by cardholders.

These assets and liabilities are predominantly \ncarried at fair value on a recurring basis (i.e., assets and \nliabilities that are measured and reported at fair value on \nthe Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets). Certain assets, \nliabilities and unfunded lending-related commitments are \nmeasured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, they \nare not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are \nsubject to fair value adjustments only in certain \ncircumstances (for example, when there is evidence of \nimpairment).\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to \nsell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly \ntransaction between market participants at the \nmeasurement date. Fair value is based on quoted market \nprices or inputs, where available. If prices or quotes are not \navailable, fair value is based on valuation models and other \nvaluation techniques that consider relevant transaction \ncharacteristics (such as maturity) and use, as inputs, \nobservable or unobservable market parameters, including \nyield curves, interest rates, volatilities, prices (such as \ncommodity, equity or debt prices), correlations, foreign \nexchange rates and credit curves.

Where applied, such adjustments are based on \nfactors that a relevant market participant would \nconsider in the transfer of the net open risk position, \nincluding the size of the adverse market move that is \nlikely to occur during the period required to reduce the \nnet open risk position to a normal market-size.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\n167\n\n\n•\nUncertainty adjustments related to unobservable \nparameters may be made when positions are valued \nusing prices or input parameters to valuation models \nthat are unobservable due to a lack of market activity or \nbecause they cannot be implied from observable market \ndata. Such prices or parameters must be estimated and \nare, therefore, subject to management judgment. \nAdjustments are made to reflect the uncertainty \ninherent in the resulting valuation estimate. \n•\nWhere appropriate, the Firm also applies adjustments to \nits estimates of fair value in order to appropriately \nreflect counterparty credit quality (CVA), the Firm’s own \ncreditworthiness (DVA) and the impact of funding (FVA), \nusing a consistent framework across the Firm. Refer to \nCredit and funding adjustments on page 184 of this Note \nfor more information on such adjustments.\nValuation model review and approval \nIf prices or quotes are not available for an instrument or a \nsimilar instrument, fair value is generally determined using \nvaluation models that consider relevant transaction terms \nsuch as maturity and use as inputs market-based or \nindependently sourced parameters. Where this is the case \nthe price verification process described above is applied to \nthe inputs in those models. \nUnder the Firm’s Estimations and Model Risk Management \nPolicy, MRGR reviews and approves new models, as well as \nmaterial changes to existing models, prior to \nimplement",

The three levels are defined as follows. \n•\nLevel 1 – inputs to the valuation methodology are \nquoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or \nliabilities in active markets. \n•\nLevel 2 – inputs to the valuation methodology include \nquoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active \nmarkets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or \nliability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the \nfull term of the financial instrument.\n•\nLevel 3 – one or more inputs to the valuation \nmethodology are unobservable and significant to the fair \nvalue measurement. \nA financial instrument’s categorization within the fair value \nhierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is \nsignificant to the fair value measurement.\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\n168\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\n\n\nThe following table describes the valuation methodologies generally used by the Firm to measure its significant products/\ninstruments at fair value, including the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the fair value hierarchy. \nProduct/instrument\nValuation methodology\nClassifications in the fair value  \nhierarchy\nSecurities financing agreements\nValuations are based on discounted cash flows, which consider:\nPredominantly level 2\n•  Derivative features: refer to the discussion of derivatives below \nfor further information\n•  Market rates for the respective maturity\n•  Collateral characteristics\nLoans and lending-related \ncommitments — wholesale\nLoans carried at fair value\n(trading loans and non-trading \nloans) and associated\nlending-related commitments\nWhere observable market data is available, valuations are based on:\nLevel 2 or 3\n•  Observed market prices (circumstances are infrequent)\n•  Relevant broker quotes\n•  Observed market prices for similar instruments\nWhere observable market data is unavailable or limited, valuations are \nbased on discounted cash flows, which consider the following:\n•  Credit spreads derived from the cost of CDS; or benchmark credit \ncurves developed by the Firm, by industry and credit rating\n•  Prepayment speed\n•  Collateral characteristics\nLoans — consumer\nFair value is based on observable market prices for mortgage-backed \nsecurities with similar collateral and incorporates adjustments to \nthese prices to a",

Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair value for the Firm’s physical commodities \ninventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below cost), the carrying value of physical commodities \napproximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in fair value.

Second, due to the lack of observability of significant \ninputs, management must assess relevant empirical data in \nderiving valuation inputs including transaction details, yield \ncurves, interest rates, prepayment speed, default rates, \nvolatilities, correlations, prices (such as commodity, equity or \ndebt ",

While the determination to classify an instrument \nwithin level 3 is based on the significance of the unobservable \ninputs to the overall fair value measurement, level 3 financial \ninstruments typically include observable components (that is, \ncomponents that are actively quoted and can be validated to \nexternal sources) in addition to the unobservable \ncomponents. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs are not \nincluded in the table. In addition, the Firm manages the risk \nof the observable components of level 3 financial instruments \nusing securities and derivative positions that are classified \nwithin levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy. \nThe range of values presented in the table is representative \nof the highest and lowest level input used to value the \nsignificant groups of instruments within a product/instrument \nclassification. Where provided, the weighted averages of the \ninput values presented in the table are calculated based on \nthe fair value of the instruments that the input is being used \nto value. \nIn the Firm’s view, the input range, weighted and arithmetic \naverage values do not reflect the degree of input uncertainty \nor an assessment of the reasonableness of the Firm’s \nestimates and assumptions.

Where relationships do exist \nbetween two unobservable inputs, those relationships are \ndiscussed below. Relationships may also exist between \nobservable and unobservable inputs (for example, as \nobservable interest rates rise, unobservable prepayment \nrates decline); such relationships have not been included in \nthe discussion below. In addition, for each of the individual \nrelationships described below, the inverse relationship would \nalso generally apply. \nThe following discussion also provides a description of \nattributes of the underlying instruments and external market \nfactors that affect the range of inputs used in the valuation of \nthe Firm’s positions. \nYield – The yield of an asset is the interest rate used to \ndiscount future cash flows in a discounted cash flow \ncalculation.

The credit spread for an instrument \nforms part of the discount rate used in a discounted cash flow \ncalculation. Generally, an increase in the credit spread would \nresult in a decrease in a fair value measurement. \nThe yield and the credit spread of a particular mortgage-\nbacked security primarily reflect the risk inherent in the \ninstrument. The yield is also impacted by the absolute level of \nthe coupon paid by the instrument (which may not \ncorrespond directly to the level of inherent risk).

For \ncorporate debt securities, obligations of U.S. states and \nmunicipalities and other similar instruments, credit spreads \nreflect the credit quality of the obligor and the tenor of the \nobligation. \nPrepayment speed – The prepayment speed is a measure of \nthe voluntary unscheduled principal repayments of a \nprepayable obligation in a collateralized pool. Prepayment \nspeeds generally decline as borrower delinquencies rise. An \nincrease in prepayment speeds, in isolation, would result in a \ndecrease in a fair value measurement of assets valued at a \npremium to par and an increase in a fair value measurement \nof assets valued at a discount to par. \nPrepayment speeds may vary from collateral pool to \ncollateral pool, and are driven by the type and location of the \nunderlying borrower, and the remaining tenor of the \nobligation as well as the level and type (e.g., fixed or floating) \nof interest rate being paid by the borrower. Typically \ncollateral pools with higher borrower credit quality have a \nhigher prepayment rate than those with lower borrower \ncredit quality, all other factors being equal. \nConditional default rate – The conditional default rate is a \nmeasure of the reduction in the outstanding collateral \nbalance underlying a collateralized obligation as a result of \ndefaults. While there is typically no direct relationship \nbetween conditional default rates and prepayment speeds, \ncollateralized obligations for which the underlying collateral \nhas high prepayment speeds will tend to have lower \nconditional default rates.

Correlation is a \npricing input for a derivative product where the payoff is \ndriven by one or more underlying risks. Correlation inputs are \nrelated to the type of derivative (e.g., interest rate, credit, \nequity, foreign exchange and commodity) due to the nature \nof the underlying risks. When parameters are positively \ncorrelated, an increase in one parameter will result in an \nincrease in the other parameter. When parameters are \nnegatively correlated, an increase in one parameter will \nresult in a decrease in the other parameter. An increase in \ncorrelation can result in an increase or a decrease in a fair \nvalue measurement. Given a short correlation position, an \nincrease in correlation, in isolation, would generally result in \na decrease in a fair value measurement.\nThe level of correlation used in the valuation of derivatives \nwith multiple underlying risks depends on a number of \nfactors including the nature of those risks. For example, the \ncorrelation between two credit risk exposures would be \ndifferent than that between two interest rate risk exposures. \nSimilarly, the tenor of the transaction may also impact the \ncorrelation input, as the relationship between the underlying \nrisks may be different over different time periods. \nFurthermore, correlation levels are very much dependent on \nmarket conditions and could have a relatively wide range of \nlevels within or across asset classes over time, particularly in \nvolatile market conditions. \nVolatility – Volatility is a measure of the variability in possible \nreturns for an instrument, parameter or market index given \nhow much the particular instrument, parameter or index \nchanges in value over time. Volatility is a pricing input for \noptions, including equity options, commodity options, and \ninterest rate options. Generally, the higher the volatility of \nthe underlying, the riskier the instrument. Given a long \nposition in an option, an increase in volatility, in isolation, \nwould generally result in an increase in a fair value \nmeasurement. \nThe level of volatility used in the valuation of a particular \noption-based derivative depends on a number of factors, \nincluding the nature of the risk underlying the option (e.g., \nthe volatility of a particular equity security may be \nsignificantly different from that of a particular commodity \nindex), the tenor of the derivative as well as the strike price \nof the option. \nBermudan switch value – The switch value is the difference \nbetween the overall value of a Bermudan swaption, which can \nbe exercised at multiple points in time, and its most \nexpensive European swaption and reflects the additional \nvalue that the multiple exercise dates provide the holder. \nSwi",

These market \nparameters generally do not consider factors such as \ncounterparty nonperformance risk, the Firm’s own credit \nquality, and funding costs. Therefore, it is generally \nnecessary to make adjustments to the base estimate of fair \nvalue to reflect these factors.\nCVA represents the adjustment, relative to the relevant \nbenchmark interest rate, necessary to reflect counterparty \nnonperformance risk. The Firm estimates CVA using a \nscenario analysis to estimate the expected positive credit \nexposure across all of the Firm’s existing positions with \neach counterparty, and then estimates losses based on the \nprobability of default and estimated recovery rate as a \nresult of a counterparty credit event considering \ncontractual factors designed to mitigate the Firm’s credit \nexposure, such as collateral and legal rights of offset. The \nkey inputs to this methodology are (i) the probability of a \ndefault event occurring for each counterparty, as derived \nfrom observed or estimated CDS spreads; and (ii) estimated \nrecovery rates implied by CDS spreads, adjusted to consider \nthe differences in recovery rates as a derivative creditor \nrelative to those reflected in CDS spreads, which generally \nreflect senior unsecured creditor risk.\nFVA represents the adjustment to reflect the impact of \nfunding and is recognized where there is evidence that a \nmarket participant in the principal market would \nincorporate it in a transfer of the instrument. The Firm’s \nFVA framework, applied to uncollateralized (including \npartially collateralized) over-the-counter (“OTC”) \nderivatives incorporates key inputs such as: (i) the expected \nfunding requirements arising from the Firm’s positions with \neach counterparty and collateral arrangements; and (ii) the \nestimated market funding cost in the principal market \nwhich, for derivative liabilities, considers the Firm’s credit \nrisk (DVA). For collateralized derivatives, the fair value is \nestimated by discounting expected future cash flows at the \nrelevant overnight indexed swap rate given the underlying \ncollateral agreement with the counterparty, and therefore a \nseparate FVA is not necessary.\nThe following table provides the impact of credit and \nfunding adjustments on principal transactions revenue in \nthe respective periods, excluding the effect of any \nassociated hedging activities.

In connection with the sale, and consistent with the Firm’s sale of 20 million Visa B shares in 2013, the Firm \nentered into a derivative instrument with the purchaser of the shares, under which the Firm retains the risk associated with \nchanges in the conversion rate. \nUnder the terms of the derivative instrument, the Firm will (a) make or receive payments based on subsequent changes in the \nconversion rate and (b) make periodic interest payments to the purchaser of the Visa B shares. The payments under the \nderivative continue as long as the Visa B shares remain subject to transfer restrictions. The derivative is accounted for at fair \nvalue using a discounted cash flow methodology based upon the Firm’s estimate of the timing and magnitude of final \nresolution of the litigation matters. The derivative is recorded in trading liabilities and changes in fair value are recognized in \nother income. As of December 31, 2022, the Firm held derivative instruments associated with the 23 million Visa B shares \nthat it has sold, which are all subject to similar terms and conditions.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Firm’s remaining interest in Visa B shares was approximately 37 million shares. On January 5, \n2023, Visa filed a Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC indicating that the conversion rate of Visa B shares to Visa A \nshares decreased from 1.6059 to 1.5991 effective December 29, 2022. The conversion rate may be further adjusted by Visa \ndepending on developments related to the litigation matters. The outcome of those litigation matters, and the effect that the \nresolution of those matters may have on the conversion rate, is unknown, and accordingly, as of December 31, 2022, there is \nsignificant uncertainty regarding the date of the termination of transfer restrictions and the value of the final conversion rate. \nAs a result of this, as well as differences in voting rights, Visa B shares are not considered to be similar to Visa A shares, and \nthey continue to be held at their nominal carrying value. \nAdditional disclosures about the fair value of financial \ninstruments that are not carried on the Consolidated \nbalance sheets at fair value \nU.S. GAAP requires disclosure of the estimated fair value of \ncertain financial instruments, which are included in the \nfollowing table.

For certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the value of the underlying collateral. Carrying \nvalue of the loan takes into account the loan’s allowance for loan losses, which represents the loan’s expected credit losses over its remaining expected \nlife.

For fixed-rate \ninstruments, an allocation of the changes in value for \nthe period is made between those changes in value that \nare interest rate-related and changes in value that are \ncredit-related. Allocations are generally based on an \nanalysis of borrower-specific credit spread and recovery \ninformation, where available, or benchmarking to \nsimilar entities or industries. \n•\nLong-term debt: Changes in value attributable to \ninstrument-specific credit risk were derived principally \nfrom observable changes in the Firm’s credit spread as \nobserved in the bond market. \n•\nSecurities financing agreements: Generally, for these \ntypes of agreements, there is a requirement that \ncollateral be maintained with a market value equal to or \nin excess of the principal amount loaned; as a result, \nthere would be no adjustment or an immaterial \nadjustment for instrument-specific credit risk related to \nthese agreements. \nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\n189\n\n\nDifference between aggregate fair value and aggregate remaining contractual principal balance outstanding \nThe following table reflects the difference",

JPMorgan Chase makes \nmarkets in derivatives for clients and also uses derivatives \nto hedge or manage its own risk exposures. Predominantly \nall of the Firm’s derivatives are entered into for market-\nmaking or risk management purposes. \nMarket-making derivatives \nThe majority of the Firm’s derivatives are entered into for \nmarket-making purposes. Clients use derivatives to mitigate \nor modify interest rate, credit, foreign exchange, equity and \ncommodity risks. The Firm actively manages the risks from \nits exposure to these derivatives by entering into other \nderivative contracts or by purchasing or selling other \nfinancial instruments that partially or fully offset the \nexposure from client derivatives. \nRisk management derivatives \nThe Firm manages certain market and credit risk exposures \nusing derivative instruments, including derivatives in hedge \naccounting relationships and other derivatives that are used \nto manage risks associated with specified assets and \nliabilities. \nThe Firm generally uses interest rate derivatives to manage \nthe risk associated with changes in interest rates. Fixed-rate \nassets and liabilities appreciate or depreciate in market \nvalue as interest rates change. Similarly, interest income \nand expense increase or decrease as a result of variable-\nrate assets and liabilities resetting to current market rates, \nand as a result of the repayment and subsequent \norigination or issuance of fixed-rate assets and liabilities at \ncurrent market rates. Gains and losses on the derivative \ninstruments related to these assets and liabilities are \nexpected to substantially offset this variability. \nForeign currency derivatives are used to manage the \nforeign exchange risk associated with certain foreign \ncurrency–denominated (i.e., non-U.S. dollar) assets and \nliabilities and forecasted transactions, as well as the Firm’s \nnet investments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries or branches \nwhose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar.

For example, the Firm \ndoes not apply hedge accounting to purchased CDS used to \nmanage the credit risk of loans and lending-related \ncommitments, because of the difficulties in qualifying such \ncontracts as hedges. For the same reason, the Firm does \nnot apply hedge accounting to certain interest rate, foreign \nexchange, and commodity derivatives used for risk \nmanagement purposes.  \nTo qualify for hedge accounting, a derivative must be highly \neffective at reducing the risk associated with the exposure \nbeing hedged. In addition, for a derivative to be designated \nas a hedge, the risk management objective and strategy \nmust be documented. Hedge documentation must identify \nthe derivative hedging instrument, the asset or liability or \nforecasted transaction and type of risk to be hedged, and \nhow the effectiveness of the derivative is assessed \nprospectively and retrospectively. To assess effectiveness, \nthe Firm uses statistical methods such as regression \nanalysis, nonstatistical methods such as dollar-value \ncomparisons of the change in the fair value of the derivative \nto the change in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged \nitem, and qualitative comparisons of critical terms and the \nevaluation of any changes in those terms. The extent to \nwhich a derivative has been, and is expected to continue to \nbe, highly effective at offsetting changes in the fair value or \ncash flows of the hedged item must be assessed and \ndocumented at least quarterly. If it is determined that a \nderivative is not highly effective at hedging the designated \nexposure, hedge accounting is discontinued. \nThere are three types of hedge accounting designations: fair \nvalue hedges, cash flow hedges and net investment hedges. \nJPMorgan Chase uses fair value hedges primarily to hedge \nfixed-rate long-term debt, AFS securities and certain \ncommodities inventories. For qualifying fair value hedges, \nthe changes in the fair value of the derivative, and in the \nvalue of the hedged item for the risk being hedged, are \nrecognized in earnings. Certain amounts excluded from the \nassessment of effectiveness are recorded in OCI and \nrecognized in earnings over the life of the derivative.

For qualifying cash flow \nhedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative are \nrecorded in OCI and recognized in earnings as the hedged \nitem affects earnings.

All derivatives not \nincluded in the hedge accounting or specified risk \nmanagement categories above are included in this \ncategory. Gains and losses on these derivatives are \nprimarily recorded in principal transactions revenue. Refer \nto Note 6 for information on principal transactions revenue. \nCredit derivatives \nCredit derivatives are financial instruments whose value is \nderived from the credit risk associated with the debt of a \nthird-party issuer (the reference entity) and which allow \none party (the protection purchaser) to transfer that risk to \nanother party (the protection seller). Credit derivatives \nexpose the protection purchaser to the creditworthiness of \nthe protection seller, as the protection seller is required to \nmake payments under the contract when the reference \nentity experiences a credit event, such as a bankruptcy, a \nfailure to pay its obligation or a restructuring. The seller of \ncredit protection receives a premium for providing \nprotection but has the risk that the underlying instrument \nreferenced in the contract will be subject to a credit event. \nThe Firm is both a purchaser and seller of protection in the \ncredit derivatives market and uses these derivatives for two \nprimary purposes. First, in its capacity as a market-maker, \nthe Firm actively manages a portfolio of credit derivatives \nby purchasing and selling credit protection, predominantly \non corporate debt obligations, to meet the needs of \ncustomers. Second, as an end-user, the Firm uses credit \nderivatives to manage credit risk associated with lending \nexposures (loans and unfunded commitments) in its \nwholesale and consumer businesses and derivatives \ncounterparty exposures in its wholesale businesses, and to \nmanage the credit risk arising from certain financial \ninstruments in the Firm’s market-making businesses. \nFollowing is a summary of various types of credit \nderivatives. \nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\n205\n\n\nCredit default swaps \nCredit derivatives may reference the credit of either a single \nreference entity (“single-name”), broad-based index or \nportfolio.

Like \nthe S&P 500 and other market indices, a CDS index consists \nof a portfolio of CDS across many reference entities. New \nseries of CDS indices are periodically established with a new \nunderlying portfolio of reference entities to reflect changes \nin the credit markets. If one of the reference entities in the \nindex experiences a credit event, then the reference entity \nthat defaulted is removed from the index. CDS can also be \nreferenced against specific portfolios of reference names or \nagainst customized exposure levels based on specific client \ndemands: for example, to provide protection against the \nfirst $1 million of realized credit losses in a $10 million \nportfolio of exposure. Such structures are commonly known \nas tranche CDS. \nFor both single-name CDS contracts and index CDS \ncontracts, upon the occurrence of a credit event, under the \nterms of a CDS contract neither party to the CDS contract \nhas recourse to the reference entity. The protection \npurchaser has recourse to the protection seller for the \ndifference between the face value of the CDS contract and \nthe fair value of the reference obligation at settlement of \nthe credit derivative contract, also known as the recovery \nvalue. The protection purchaser does not need to hold the \ndebt instrument of the underlying reference entity in order \nto receive amounts due under the CDS contract when a \ncredit event occurs. \nCredit-related notes \nA credit-related note is a funded derivative with a credit risk \ncomponent where the issuer of the credit-related note \npurchases from the note investor credit protection on a \nreference entity or an index. Under the contract, the \ninvestor pays the issuer the par value of the note at the \ninception of the transaction, and in return, the issuer pays \nperiodic payments to the investor, based on the credit risk \nof the referenced entity. The issuer also repays the investor \nthe par value of the note at maturity unless the reference \nentity (or one of the entities that makes up a reference \nindex) experiences a specified credit event. If a credit event \noccurs, the issuer is not obligated to repay the par value of \nthe note, but rather, the issuer pays the investor the \ndifference between the par value of the note and the fair \nvalue of the defaulted reference obligation at the time of \nsettlement.

Under the \nterms of the LTIP, as of December 31, 2022, 69 million \nshares of common stock were available for issuance \nthrough May 2025. The LTIP is the only active plan under \nwhich the Firm is currently granting share-based incentive \nawards. In the following discussion, the LTIP, plus prior Firm \nplans and plans assumed as the result of acquisitions, are \nreferred to collectively as the “LTI Plans,” and such plans \nconstitute the Firm’s share-based incentive plans. \nRSUs are awarded at no cost to the recipient upon their \ngrant. Generally, RSUs are granted annually and vest at a \nrate of 50% after two years and 50% after three years and \nare converted into shares of common stock as of the vesting \ndate. In addition, RSUs typically include full-career eligibility \nprovisions, which allow employees to continue to vest upon \nvoluntary termination based on age and/or service-related \nrequirements, subject to post-employment and other \nrestrictions. All RSU awards are subject to forfeiture until \nvested and contain clawback provisions that may result in \ncancellation under certain specified circumstances. \nPredominantly all RSUs entitle the recipient to receive cash \npayments equivalent to any dividends paid on the \nunderlying common stock during the period the RSUs are \noutstanding. \nPerformance share units (“PSUs”) are granted annually, \nand approved by the Firm’s Board of Directors, to members \nof the Firm’s Operating Committee under the variable \ncompensation program. PSUs are subject to the Firm’s \nachievement of specified performance criteria over a three-\nyear period. The number of awards that vest can range \nfrom zero to 150% of the grant amount. In addition, \ndividends that accrue during the vesting period are \nreinvested in dividend equivalent share units. PSUs and the \nrelated dividend equivalent share units are converted into \nshares of common stock after vesting.\nOnce the PSUs and dividend equivalent share units have \nvested, the shares of common stock that are delivered, after \napplicable tax withholding, must be retained for an \nadditional holding period, for a total combined vesting and \nholding period of approximately five to eight years from the \ngrant date depending on regulations in certain countries. \nUnder the LTI Plans, stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) and \nst",

For awards with full-career \neligibility provisions and awards granted with no future \nsubstantive service requirement, the Firm accrues the \nestimated value of awards expected to be awarded to \nemployees as of the grant date without giving consideration \nto the impact of post-employment restrictions.

The Firm accounts for loans based on \nthe following categories:\n•\nOriginated or purchased loans held-for-investment (i.e., \n“retained”)\n•\nLoans held-for-sale\n•\nLoans at fair value\nThe following provides a detailed accounting discussion of \nthe Firm’s loans by category:\nLoans held-for-investment\nOriginated or purchased loans held-for-investment, \nincluding PCD, are recorded at amortized cost, reflecting \nthe principal amount outstanding, net of the following: \nunamortized deferred loan fees, costs, premiums or \ndiscounts; charge-offs; collection of cash; and foreign \nexchange. Credit card loans also include billed finance \ncharges and fees.\nInterest income\nInterest income on performing loans held-for-investment is \naccrued and recognized as interest income at the \ncontractual rate of interest. Purchase price discounts or \npremiums, as well as net deferred loan fees or costs, are \namortized into interest income over the contractual life of \nthe loan as an adjustment of yield.\nThe Firm classifies accrued interest on loans, including \naccrued but unbilled interest on credit card loans, in \naccrued interest and accounts receivables on the \nConsolidated balance sheets. For credit card loans, accrued \ninterest once billed is then recognized in the loan balances, \nwith the related allowance recorded in the allowance for \ncredit losses. Changes in the allowance for credit losses on \naccrued interest on credit card loans are recognized in the \nprovision for credit losses and charge-offs are recognized \nby reversing interest income. For other loans, the Firm \ngenerally does not recognize an allowance for credit losses \non accrued interest receivables, consistent with its policy to \nwrite them off no later than 90 days past due by reversing \ninterest income. \nNonaccrual loans \nNonaccrual loans are those on which the accrual of interest \nhas been suspended. Loans (other than credit card loans \nand certain consumer loans insured by U.S. government \nagencies) are placed on nonaccrual status and considered \nnonperforming when full payment of principal and",

A loan is determined to be past \ndue when the minimum payment is not received from the \nborrower by the contractually specified due date or for \ncertain loans (e.g., residential real estate loans), when a \nmonthly payment is due and unpaid for 30 days or more. \nFinally, collateral-dependent loans are typically maintained \non nonaccrual status. \nOn the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, all \ninterest accrued but not collected is reversed against \ninterest income. In addition, the amortization of deferred \namounts is suspended. Interest income on nonaccrual loans \nmay be recognized as cash interest payments are received \n(i.e., on a cash basis) if the recorded loan balance is \ndeemed fully collectible; however, if there is doubt \nregarding the ultimate collectibility of the recorded loan \nbalance, all interest cash receipts are applied to reduce the \ncarrying value of the loan (the cost recovery method). For \nconsumer loans, application of this policy typically results in \nthe Firm recognizing interest income on nonaccrual \nconsumer loans on a cash basis.\nA loan may be returned to accrual status when repayment is \nreasonably assured and there has been demonstrated \nperformance under the terms of the loan or, if applicable, \nthe terms of the restructured loan. \nAs permitted by regulatory guidance, credit card loans are \ngenerally exempt from being placed on nonaccrual status; \naccordingly, interest and fees related to credit card loans \ncontinue to accrue until the loan is charged off or paid in \nfull. \nAllowance for loan losses \nThe allowance for loan losses represents the estimated \nexpected credit losses in the held-for-investment loan \nportfolio at the balance sheet date and is recognized on the \nbalance sheet as a contra asset, which brings the amortized \ncost to the net carrying value. Changes in the allowance for \nloan losses are recorded in the provision for credit losses on \nthe Firm’s Consolidated statements of income. Refer to \nNote 13 for further information on the Firm’s accounting \npolicies for the allowance for loan losses. \nCharge-offs \nConsumer loans are generally charged off or charged down \nto the lower of the amortized cost or the net realizable \nvalue of the underlying collateral (i.e., fair value less \nestimated costs to sell), with an offset to the allowance for \nloan losses, upon reaching specified stages of delinquency \nin accordance with standards established by the FFIEC. \nResidential real estate loans, unmodified credit card loans \nand scored business banking loans are generally charged \noff no later than 180 days past due.

The determination of whether \nto recognize a charge-off includes many factors, including \nthe prioritization of the Firm’s claim in bankruptcy, \nexpectations of the workout/restructuring of the loan and \nvaluation of the borrower’s equity or the loan collateral. \nWhen a loan is charged down to the lower of its amortized \ncost or the estimated net realizable value of the underlying \ncollateral, the determination of the fair value of the \ncollateral depends on the type of collateral (e.g., securities, \nreal estate). In cases where the collateral is in the form of \nliquid securities, the fair value is based on quoted market \nprices or broker quotes. For illiquid securities or other \nfinancial assets, the fair value of the collateral is generally \nestimated using a discounted cash flow model. \nFor residential real estate loans, collateral values are based \nupon external valuation sources. When it becomes likely \nthat a borrower is either unable or unwilling to pay, the \nFirm utilizes a broker’s price opinion, appraisal and/or an \nautomated valuation model of the home based on an \nexterior-only valuation (“exterior opinions”), which is then \nupdated at least every 12 months, or more frequently \ndepending on various market factors. As soon as practicable \nafter the Firm receives the property in satisfaction of a debt \n(e.g., by taking legal title or physical possession), the Firm \ngenerally obtains an appraisal based on an inspection that \nincludes the interior of the home (“interior appraisals”). \nExterior opinions and interior appraisals are discounted \nbased upon the Firm’s experience with actual liquidation \nvalues as compared with the estimated values provided by \nexterior opinions and interior appraisals, considering state-\nspecific factors. \nFor commercial real estate loans, collateral values are \ngenerally based on appraisals from internal and external \nvaluation sources. Collateral values are typically updated \nevery six to twelve months, either by obtaining a new \nappraisal or by performing an internal analysis, in \naccordance with the Firm’s policies.

Through the modification, \nJPMorgan Chase grants one or more concessions to a \nborrower who is experiencing financial difficulty in order to \nminimize the Firm’s economic loss and avoid foreclosure or \nrepossession of the collateral, and to ultimately maximize \npayments received by the Firm from the borrower. The \nconcessions granted vary by program and by borrower-\nspecific characteristics, and may include interest rate \nreductions, term extensions, payment delays, principal \nforgiveness, or the acceptance of equity or other assets in \nlieu of payments. Such modifications are accounted for and \nreported as TDRs. Loans with short-term and other \ninsignificant modifications that are not considered \nconcessions are not TDRs. \nLoans, except for credit card loans, modified in a TDR are \ngenerally placed on nonaccrual status, although in many \ncases such loans were already on nonaccrual status prior to \nmodification. These loans may be returned to performing \nstatus (the accrual of interest is resumed) if the following \ncriteria are met: (i) the borrower has performed under the \nmodified terms for a minimum of six months and/or six \npayments, and (ii) the Firm has an expectation that \nrepayment of the modified loan is reasonably assured based \non, for example, the borrower’s debt capacity and level of \nfuture earnings, collateral values, LTV ratios, and other \ncurrent market considerations. In certain limited and well-\ndefined circumstances in which the loan is current at the \nmodification date, such loans are not placed on nonaccrual \nstatus at the time of modification. \nLoans modified in TDRs are generally measured for \nimpairment using the Firm’s established asset-specific \nallowance methodology, which considers the expected re-\ndefault rates for the modified loans. A loan modified in a \nTDR generally remains subject to the asset-specific \ncomponent of the allowance throughout its remaining life, \nregardless of whether the loan is performing and has been \nreturned to accrual status. Refer to Note 13 for further \ndiscussion of the methodology used to estimate the Firm’s \nasset-specific allowance. \nForeclosed property \nThe Firm acquires property from borrowers through loan \nrestructurings, workouts, and foreclosures. Property \nacquired may include real property (e.g., residential real \nestate, land, and buildings) and commercial and personal \nproperty (e.g., automobiles, aircraft, railcars, and ships). \nThe Firm recognizes foreclosed property upon receiving \nassets in satisfaction of a loan (e.g., by taking legal title or \nphysical possession).

Loans that are more than 30 days past \ndue provide an early warning of borrowers who may be \nexperiencing financial difficulties and/or who may be \nunable or unwilling to repay the loan. As the loan continues \nto age, it becomes more clear whether the borrower is likely \nto be unable or unwilling to pay. In the case of residential \nreal estate loans, late-stage delinquencies (greater than \n150 days past due) are a strong indicator of loans that will \nultimately result in a foreclosure or similar liquidation \ntransaction. In addition to delinquency rates, other credit \nquality indicators for consumer loans vary based on the \nclass of loan, as follows: \n•\nFor residential real estate loans, the current estimated \nLTV ratio, or the combined LTV ratio in the case of junior \nlien loans, is an indicator of the potential loss severity in \nthe event of default. Additionally, LTV or combined LTV \nratios can provide insight into a borrower’s continued \nwillingness to pay, as the delinquency rate of high-LTV \nloans tends to be greater than that for loans where the \nborrower has equity in the collateral. The geographic \ndistribution of the loan collateral also provides insight as \nto the credit quality of the portfolio, as factors such as \nthe regional economy, home price changes and specific \nevents such as natural disasters, will affect credit \nquality. The borrower’s current or “refreshed” FICO \nscore is a secondary credit quality indicator for certain \nloans, as FICO scores are an indication of the borrower’s \ncredit payment history. Thus, a loan to a borrower with a \nlow FICO score (less than 660) is considered to be of \nhigher risk than a loan to a borrower with a higher FICO \nscore. Further, a loan to a borro",

Risk ratings \nare used to identify the credit quality of loans and \ndifferentiate risk within the portfolio. Risk ratings on loans \nconsider the PD and the LGD. The PD is the likelihood that a \nloan will default. The LGD is the estimated loss on the loan \nthat would be realized upon the default of the borrower and \ntakes into consideration collateral and structural support \nfor each credit facility. \nManagement considers several factors to determine an \nappropriate internal risk rating, including the obligor’s debt \ncapacity and financial flexibility, the level of the obligor’s \nearnings, the amount and sources for repayment, the level \nand nature of contingencies, management strength, and the \nindustry and geography in which the obligor operates. The \nFirm’s internal risk ratings generally align with the \nqualitative characteristics (e.g., borrower capacity to meet \nfinancial commitments and vulnerability to changes in the \neconomic environment) defined by S&P and Moody’s, \nhowever the quantitative characteristics (e.g., PD and LGD) \nmay differ as they reflect internal historical experiences and \nassumptions. The Firm generally considers internal ratings \nwith qualitative characteristics equivalent to BBB-/Baa3 or \nhigher as investment grade, and these ratings have a lower \nPD and/or lower LGD than non-investment grade ratings.  \nNoninvestment-grade ratings are further classified as \nnoncriticized and criticized, and the criticized portion is \nfurther subdivided into performing and nonaccrual loans, \nrepresenting management’s assessment of the collectibility \nof principal and interest. Criticized loans have a higher PD \nthan noncriticized loans. The Firm’s definition of criticized \naligns with the U.S. banking regulatory definition of \ncriticized exposures, which consist of special mention, \nsubstandard and doubtful categories.  \nRisk ratings are reviewed on a regular and ongoing basis by \nCredit Risk Management and are adjusted as necessary for \nupdated information affecting the obligor’s ability to fulfill \nits obligations.\nAs noted above, the risk rating of a loan considers the \nindustry in which the obligor conducts its operations. As \npart of the overall credit risk management framework, the \nFirm focuses on the management and diversification of its \nindustry and client exposures, with particular attention paid \nto industries with an actual or potential credit concern. \nRefer to Note 4 for further detail on industry \nconcentrations.\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\n238\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\n\n\nThe following tables provide information on internal risk rating, which is the primary credit quality indicator for retained \nwholesale loans.\nDecember 31,\n(in ",

At least quarterly, the allowance for credit losses \nis reviewed by the CRO, the CFO and the Controller of the \nFirm. Subsequent evaluations of credit exposures, \nconsidering the macroeconomic conditions, forecasts and \nother factors then prevailing, may result in significant \nchanges in the allowance for credit losses in future periods. \nThe Firm’s policies used to determine its allowance for loan \nlosses and its allowance for lending-related commitments \nare described in the following paragraphs. Refer to Note 10 \nfor a description of the policies used to determine the \nallowance for credit losses on investment securities. \nMethodology for allowances for loan losses and lending-\nrelated commitments\nThe allowance for loan losses and allowance for lending-\nrelated commitments represents expected credit losses \nover the remaining expected life of retained loans and \nlending-related commitments that are not unconditionally \ncancellable. The Firm does not record an allowance for \nfuture draws on unconditionally cancellable lending-related \ncommitments (e.g., credit cards). Expected losses related to \naccrued interest on credit card loans are considered in the \nFirm’s allowance for loan losses. However, the Firm does \nnot record an allowance on other accrued interest \nreceivables, due to its policy to write these receivables off \nno later than 90 days past due by reversing interest \nincome. \nThe expected life of each instrument is determined by \nconsidering its contractual term, expected prepayments, \ncancellation features, and certain extension and call \noptions. The expected life of funded credit card loans is \ngenerally estimated by considering expected future \npayments on the credit card account, and determining how \nmuch of those amounts should be allocated to repayments \nof the funded loan balance (as of the balance sheet date) \nversus other account activity. This allocation is made using \nan approach that incorporates the payment application \nrequirements of the Credit Card Accountability \nResponsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009, generally paying \ndown the highest interest rate balances first. \nThe estimate of expected credit losses includes expected \nrecoveries of amounts previously charged off or expected to \nbe charged off, even if such recoveries result in a negative \nallowance. \nCollective and Individual Assessments\nWhen calculating the allowance for loan losses and the \nallowance for lending-related commitments, the Firm \nassesses whether exposures share similar risk \ncharacteristics. If similar risk characteristics exist, the Firm \nestimates expected credit losses collectively, considering \nthe risk associated with a partic",

The assessment of risk characteristics is subject to \nsignificant management judgment. Emphasizing one \ncharacteristic over another or considering additional \ncharacteristics could affect the allowance. \n• Relevant risk characteristics for the consumer portfolio \ninclude product type, delinquency status, current FICO \nscores, geographic distribution, and, for collateralized \nloans, current LTV ratios.  \n• Relevant risk characteristics for the wholesale portfolio \ninclude risk rating, delinquency status, tenor, level and \ntype of collateral, LOB, geography, industry, credit \nenhancement, product type, facility purpose, and \npayment terms. \nThe majority of the Firm’s credit exposures share risk \ncharacteristics with other similar exposures, and as a result \nare collectively assessed for impairment (“portfolio-based \ncomponent”). The portfolio-based component covers \nconsumer loans, performing risk-rated loans and certain \nlending-related commitments. \nIf an exposure does not share risk characteristics with other \nexposures, the Firm generally estimates expected credit \nlosses on an individual basis, considering expected \nrepayment and conditions impacting that individual \nexposure (“asset-specific component”). The asset-specific \ncomponent covers modified PCD loans, loans modified or \nreasonably expected to be modified in a TDR, collateral-\ndependent loans, as well as, risk-rated loans that have been \nplaced on nonaccrual status. \nPortfolio-based component\nThe portfolio-based component begins with a quantitative \ncalculation that considers the likelihood of the borrower \nchanging delinquency status or moving from one risk rating \nto another.

For collateral-dependent loans, the fair value of \ncollateral less estimated costs to sell is used to determine \nthe charge-off amount for declines in value (to reduce the \namortized cost of the loan to the fair value of collateral) or \nthe amount of negative allowance that should be \nrecognized (for recoveries of prior charge-offs associated \nwith improvements in the fair value of collateral). \nThe asset-specific component of the allowance for loans \nthat have been or are expected to be modified in TDRs \nincorporates the effect of the modification on the loan’s \nexpected cash flows (including forgone interest, principal \nforgiveness, as well as other concessions), and also the \npotential for redefault.

As a result, CIB at times retains senior \nand/or subordinated interests (including residual interests \nand amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk \nretention rules) in residential mortgage securitizations at \nthe time of securitization, and/or reacquires positions in the \nsecondary market in the normal course of business. In \ncertain instances, as a result of the positions retained or \nreacquired by CIB or held by Treasury and CIO or CCB, when \nconsidered together with the servicing arrangements \nentered into by CCB, the Firm is deemed to be the primary \nbeneficiary of certain securitization trusts. \nThe Firm does not consolidate residential mortgage \nsecuritizations (Firm-sponsored or third-party-sponsored) \nwhen it is not the servicer (and therefore does not have the \npower to direct the most significant activities of the trust) \nor does not hold a beneficial interest in the trust that could \npotentially be significant to the trust.\nCommercial mortgages and other consumer securitizations\nCIB originates and securitizes commercial mortgage loans, \nand engages in underwriting and trading activities involving \nthe securities issued by securitization trusts. CIB may retain \nunsold senior and/or subordinated interests (including \namounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk \nretention rules) in commercial mortgage securitizations at \nthe time of securitization but, generally, the Firm does not \nservice commercial loan securitizations. Treasury and CIO \nmay choose to invest in these securitizations as well. For \ncommercial mortgage securitizations the power to direct \nthe significant activities of the VIE generally is held by the \nservicer or investors in a specified class of securities \n(“controlling class”).

The residuals are retained by the investor \nseeking to finance its municipal bond investment. TOB \ntransactions where the residual is held by a third-party \ninvestor are typically known as customer TOB trusts, and \nnon-customer TOB trusts are transactions where the \nResidual is retained by the Firm.

This approach \nprojects cash flows for the forecast period and uses the \nperpetuity growth method to calculate terminal values. \nThese cash flows and terminal values, which are based on \nthe reporting units’ annual budgets and forecasts are then \ndiscounted using an appropriate discount rate.

To assess the reasonableness \nof the discount rates used for each reporting unit, \nmanagement compares the discount rate to the estimated \ncost of equity for publicly traded institutions with similar \nbusinesses and risk characteristics.

In \nevaluating this comparison, the Firm considers several \nfactors, including (i) a control premium that would exist in a \nmarket transaction, (ii) factors related to the level of \nexecution risk that would exist at the Firmwide level that do \nnot exist at the reporting unit level and (iii) short-term \nmarket volatility and other factors that do not directly \naffect the value of individual reporting units.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\n255\n\n\nUnanticipated declines in business performance, increases \nin credit losses, increases in capital requirements, as well as \ndeterioration in economic or market conditions, adverse \nregulatory or legislative changes or increases in the \nestimated market cost of equity, could cause the estimated \nfair values of the Firm’s reporting units to decline in the \nfuture, which could result in a material impairment charge \nto earnings in a future period related to some portion of the \nassociated goodwill. \nMortgage servicing rights\nMS",

The fair value \nconsiders estimated future servicing fees and ancillary \nrevenue, offset by estimated costs to service the loans, and \ngenerally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are \nreceived, effectively amortizing the MSR asset against \ncontractual servicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are \neither purchased from third parties or recognized upon sale \nor securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained.\nAs permitted by U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to account \nfor its MSRs at fair value. The Firm treats its MSRs as a \nsingle class of servicing assets based on the availability of \nmarket inputs used to measure the fair value of its MSR \nasset and its treatment of MSRs as one aggregate pool for \nrisk management purposes. The Firm estimates the fair \nvalue of MSRs using an option-adjusted spread (“OAS”) \nmodel, which projects MSR cash flows over multiple interest \nrate scenarios in conjunction with the Firm’s prepayment \nmodel, and then discounts these cash flows at risk-adjusted \nrates. The model considers portfolio characteristics, \ncontractually specified servicing fees, prepayment \nassumptions, delinquency rates, costs to service, late \ncharges and other ancillary revenue, and other economic \nfactors.

MSRs \ntypically decrease in value when interest rates decline \nbecause declining interest rates tend to increase \nprepayments and therefore reduce the expected life of the \nnet servicing cash flows that comprise the MSR asset. \nConversely, securities (e.g., mortgage-backed securities), \nand certain derivatives (e.g., those for which the Firm \nreceives fixed-rate interest payments) increase in value \nwhen interest rates decline. JPMorgan Chase uses \ncombinations of derivatives and securities to manage the \nrisk of changes in the fair value of MSRs.

The Firm also issues commitments under \nmultipurpose facilities which could be drawn upon in \nseveral forms, including the issuance of a standby letter of \ncredit. \nGuarantees \nU.S. GAAP requires that a guarantor recognize, at the \ninception of a guarantee, a liability in an amount equal to \nthe fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the \nguarantee. U.S. GAAP defines a guarantee as a contract that \ncontingently requires the guarantor to pay a guaranteed \nparty based upon: (a) changes in an underlying asset, \nliability or equity security of the guaranteed party; or (b) a \nthird party’s failure to perform under a specified \nagreement. The Firm considers the following off–balance \nsheet arrangements to be guarantees under U.S. GAAP: \nstandby letters of credit and other financial guarantees, \nsecurities lending indemnifications, certain indemnification \nagreements included within third-party contractual \narrangements, certain derivative contracts and the \nguarantees under the sponsored member repo program. \nAs required by U.S. GAAP, the Firm initially records \nguarantees at the inception date fair value of the non-\ncontingent obligation assumed (e.g., the amount of \nconsideration received or the net present value of the \npremium receivable). For these obligations, the Firm \nrecords this fair value amount in other liabilities with an \noffsetting entry recorded in cash (for premiums received), \nor other assets (for premiums receivable). Any premium \nreceivable recorded in other assets is reduced as cash is \nreceived under the contract, and the fair value of the \nliability recorded at inception is amortized into income as \nlending and deposit-related fees over the life of the \nguarantee contract. The lending-related contingent \nobligation is recognized based on expected credit losses in \naddition to, and separate from, any non-contingent \nobligation.\nNon-lending-related contingent obligations are recognized \nwhen the liability becomes probable and reasonably \nestimable. These obligations are not recognized if the \nestimated amount is less than the carrying amount of any \nnon-contingent liability recognized at inception (adjusted \nfor any amortization). Examples of non-lending-related \ncontingent obligations include indemnifications provided in \nsales agreements, where a portion of the sale proceeds is \nallocated to the guarantee, which adjusts the gain or loss \nthat would otherwise result from the transaction. For these \nindemnifications, the initial liability is amortized to income \nas the Firm’s risk is reduced (i.e., over time or when the \nindemnification expires).\nThe contractual amount and carrying value of guarantees \nand indemnifications are included in",

The Firm \nmay enter into written put option contracts in order to meet \nclient needs, or for other trading purposes. The terms of \nwritten put options are typically five years or less. \nDerivatives deemed to be guarantees also includes stable \nvalue contracts, commonly referred to as “stable value \nproducts”, that require the Firm to make a payment of the \ndifference between the market value and the book value of \na counterparty’s reference portfolio of assets in the event \nthat market value is less than book value and certain other \nconditions have been met. Stable value products are \ntransacted in order to allow investors to realize investment \nreturns with less volatility than an unprotected portfolio. \nThese contracts are typically longer-term or may have no \nstated maturity, but allow the Firm to elect to terminate the \ncontract under certain conditions. \nThe notional value of derivative guarantees generally \nrepresents the Firm’s maximum exposure. However, \nexposure to certain stable value products is contractually \nlimited to a substantially lower percentage of the notional \namount. \nThe fair value of derivative guarantees reflects the \nprobability, in the Firm’s view, of whether the Firm will be \nrequired to perform under the contract.

In nonrecourse servicing, the principal \ncredit risk to the Firm is the cost of temporary servicing \nadvances of funds (i.e., normal servicing advances). In \nrecourse servicing, the servicer agrees to share credit risk \nwith the owner of the mortgage loans, such as Fannie Mae \nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\n279\n\n\nor Freddie Mac or a private investor, insurer or guarantor. \nLosses on recourse servicing predominantly occur when \nforeclosure sales proceeds of the property underlying a \ndefaulted loan are less than the sum of the outstanding \nprincipal balance, plus accrued interest on the loan and the \ncost of holding and disposing of the underlying property. \nThe Firm’s securitizations are predominantly nonrecourse, \nthereby effectively transferring the risk of future credit \nlosses to the purchaser of the mortgage-backed securities \nissued by the trust.

The obligations of the subsidiaries are \nincluded on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets or are \nreflected as off-balance sheet commitments; therefore, the \nParent Company has not recognized a separate liability for \nthese guarantees. The Firm believes that the occurrence of \nany event that would trigger payments by the Parent \nCompany under these guarantees is remote. \nThe Parent Company has guaranteed certain long-term debt \nand structured notes of its subsidiaries, including JPMorgan \nChase Financial Company LLC (“JPMFC”), a 100%-owned \nfinance subsidiary. All securities issued by JPMFC are fully \nand unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent Company and \nno other subsidiary of the parent company guarantees \nthese securities.

The Firm’s \ndefinition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. \nGAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to \npresent total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the \nreportable business segments) on an FTE basis. \nAccordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax \ncredits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the \nmanaged results on a basis comparable to taxable \ninvestments and securities. This allows management to \nassess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year \narising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The \ncorresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt \nitems is recorded within income tax expense/(benefit). \nThese adjustments have no impact on net income as \nreported by the Firm as a whole or by the LOBs.\nCapital allocation\nEach business segment is allocated capital by taking into \nconsideration a variety of factors including capital levels of \nsimilarly rated peers and applicable regulatory capital \nrequirements. ROE is measured and internal targets for \nexpected returns are established as key measures of a \nbusiness segment’s performance.\nThe Firm’s allocation methodology incorporates Basel III \nStandardized RWA, Basel III Advanced RWA, the GSIB \nsurcharge, and a simulation of capital in a severe stress \nenvironment. At least annually, the assumptions, judgments \nand methodologies used to allocate capital are reassessed \nand, as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may \nchange. \nSegment results and reconciliation(a)\n(Table continued on next page)\nAs of or for the year \nended \nDecember 31, \n(in millions, except ratios)\nConsumer & Community Banking\nCorporate & Investment Bank\nCommercial Banking\nAsset & Wealth Management\n2022\n2021\n2020\n2022\n2021\n2020\n2022\n2021\n2020\n2022\n2021\n2020\nNoninterest revenue\n$ 15,089 \n$ 17,286 \n$ 17,740 \n$ 35,999 \n$ 38,209 \n$ 35,120 \n$ 3,336 \n$ 3,929 \n$ 3,067 \n$ 12,507 \n$ 13,071 \n$ 10,822 \nNet interest income\n 39,928 \n 32,787 \n 33,528 \n 11,900 \n 13,540 \n 14,164 \n 8,197 \n 6,079 \n 6,246 \n 5,241 \n 3,886 \n 3,418 \nTotal net revenue\n 55,017 \n 50,073 \n 51,268 \n 47,899 \n 51,749 \n 49,284 \n 11,533 \n 10,008 \n 9,313 \n 17,748 \n 16,957 \n 14,240 \nProvision for credit losses\n \n3,813 \n (6,989) \n 12,312 \n \n1,158 \n (1,174) \n \n2,726 \n 1,268 \n \n(947) \n 2,113 \n \n128 \n \n(227) \n \n263 \nNoninterest expense\n 31,471 \n 29,256 \n 27,990 \n 27,087 \n 25,325 \n 23,538 \n 4,719 \n 4,041 \n 3,798 \n 11,8",

In this analysis, when the change \ncannot be isolated to either volume or rate, it has been allocated to volume. The annual rates include the impact of changes in \nmarket rates, as well as the impact of any change in composition of the various products within each category of asset or liability. \nThis analysis is calculated separately for each category without consideration of the relationship between categories (for example, \nthe net spread between the rates earned on assets and the rates paid on liabilities that fund those assets). As a result, changes in \nthe granularity or groupings considered in this analysis would produce a different attribution result, and due to the complexities \ninvolved, precise allocation of changes in interest rates between volume and rates is inherently complex and judgmental.\n2022 versus 2021\n2021 versus 2020\n(Unaudited)\nIncrease/(decrease) due \nto change in:\nIncrease/(decrease) due \nto change in:\nYear ended December 31,\n(On a taxable-equivalent basis; in millions)\nVolume\nRate\nNet\nchange\nVolume\nRate\nNet\nchange\nInterest-earning assets\nDeposits with banks:\nU.S.\n$ \n(1,185) $ \n7,910 \n$ \n6,725 \n$ \n308 \n$ \n(383) $ \n(75) \nNon-U.S.\n \n166 \n \n1,636 \n \n1,802 \n \n(42)  \n(120)  \n(162) \nFederal funds sold and securities purchased under resale \nagreements:\nU.S.\n \n267 \n \n1,625 \n \n1,892 \n \n(66)  \n(976)  \n(1,042) \nNon-U.S.\n \n311 \n \n1,471 \n \n1,782 \n \n75 \n \n(511)  \n(436) \nSecurities borrowed:(a)\nU.S.\n \n64 \n \n2,066 \n \n2,130 \n \n(84)  \n70 \n \n(14) \nNon-U.S.\n \n69 \n \n423 \n \n492 \n \n(13)  \n(56)  \n(69) \nTrading assets – debt instruments:\nU.S.\n \n375 \n \n1,509 \n \n1,884 \n \n(1,267)  \n(259)  \n(1,526) \nNon-U.S.\n \n(418)  \n775 \n \n357 \n \n481 \n \n32 \n \n513 \nInvestment securities:\nU.S.\n \n1,061 \n \n2,534 \n \n3,595 \n \n1,170 \n \n(2,474)  \n(1,304) \nNon-U.S.\n \n(2)  \n207 \n \n205 \n \n(44)  \n(136)  \n(180) \nLoans:\n \nU.S.\n \n2,988 \n \n6,750 \n \n9,738 \n \n600 \n \n(3,093)  \n(2,493) \nNon-U.S.\n \n148 \n \n1,328 \n \n1,476 \n \n355 \n \n(85)  \n270 \nAll other interest-earning assets, predominantly U.S.\n \n161 \n \n2,708 \n \n2,869 \n \n320 \n \n(449)  \n(129) \nChange in interest income\n \n4,005 \n \n30,942 \n \n34,947 \n \n1,793 \n \n(8,4",

All of the Alerian ETNs authorized for issuance were issued as of June 2012.  \n10,000,000 Alerian ETNs were retired on December 16, 2015.  Accordingly, since the retirement of these notes, the maximum \nnumber of Alerian ETNs authorized for issuance is 119,000,000 with an aggregate principal amount of $2,265,356,590, all of which \nhas been issued and remain outstanding as of December 31, 2019.\nThe Alerian ETNs are linked to the Alerian MLP Index (the “Index”) and are our unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and will \nrank pari passu with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations.  The Alerian ETNs do not guarantee any return of \nprincipal at, or prior to, maturity or upon early repurchase.  Any payment on the Alerian ETNs is subject to the credit risk of \nJPMorgan Chase & Co.\nThe Alerian ETNs are part of a series of our debt securities entitled “Global Medium-Term Notes, Series E” (the “Series E Notes”) that \nwe may issue under the 2001 Indenture from time to time.  For more information about the Series E Notes, please see the section \ntitled “General Terms of the Series E Notes” below.  \nThe Alerian ETNs are not bank deposits and are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or by any other \ngovernmental agency, nor are they obligations of, or guaranteed by, a bank.\n\n\nUnless otherwise specified, references herein to “holders” mean those in whose names the Alerian ETNs are registered on the books \nthat we or the Trustee, or any successor trustee, as applicable, maintain for this purpose, and not those who own beneficial interests \nin the Alerian ETNs (registered in street name or otherwise).\nPlease see “Certain Defined Terms” below for an explanation of any capitalized terms used herein that are not otherwise defined.\nThe Index\nThe return of the Alerian ETNs is linked to the performance of the Index.

The Daily Note Value reflects the cumulative \nperformance of the VWAP Level of the Index since April 1, 2009, which we refer to as the Inception Date.

Any payment on the Callable Notes issued by JPMorgan Financial is \nsubject to the credit risk of JPMorgan Finance Callable Notes, and the credit risk of JPMorgan Chase & Co., as guarantor of the \nCallable Notes.\nThe Callable Notes are part of a series of the Issuer’s debt securities entitled “Global Medium-Term Notes, Series A” (the “Series A \nNotes”) that the Issuer may issue under the 2016 Indenture from time to time.

These statements often contain financial metrics such as net interest income, total assets, total equity, and net income, which can be used to calculate metrics like return on assets and return on equity.\n- The phrase \"financial condition, results of operations and cash flows\" is also mentioned, which suggests that the report includes information about the company's financial performance and position.\n\nUnfortunately, without access to the full report or additional context, it is not possible to extract specific financial metrics from this excerpt.\n\nIf you would like to provide more context or the full report, I can try\nCitations: \n\n\nTask ID: 0, Chunk ID: 522\nAnswers: \nExplanations: No relevant information found.\nCitations: \n\n\n\n## Instructions\nThink step-by-step about:\n1.

      "output": "### Analysis\n\n1. **Information Gathered**: \n   - The collected outputs primarily focus on various financial metrics relevant to JPMorgan Chase, such as Return on Equity (ROE), Return on Assets (ROA), net interest income, and other financial performance indicators. However, there is a notable absence of direct mentions of \"gross margins\" for JPMorgan Chase.\n   - The outputs indicate that metrics like net interest margin, return on equity, and return on assets are more relevant for a financial institution like JPMorgan Chase, rather than gross margins, which are typically used for companies that sell goods.\n\n2. **Sufficiency of Information**:\n   - The information gathered is not sufficient to directly answer the question about JPMorgan Chase's gross margins, as there are no direct mentions or calculations of gross margins in the outputs.\n   - The outputs suggest that gross margins are not a relevant metric for JPMorgan Chase, which aligns with the understanding that financial institutions focus on different performance metrics.\n\n3. **Missing Information**:\n   - Specific data or historical trends on JPMorgan Chase's gross margins, if they were relevant, are missing.\n   - A clear explanation or confirmation from the document that gross margins are indeed not applicable to JPMorgan Chase would be helpful.\n\n4. **Calculation or Derivation**:\n   - If gross margins were relevant, we would need historical revenue and cost of goods sold data to calculate them. However, since gross margins are not typically used for financial institutions, this calculation is not applicable here.\n\n5. **Conflicting Answers**:\n   - There are no conflicting answers regarding gross margins, as the outputs consistently do not mention them. The focus is on other financial metrics that are more pertinent to a financial institution.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe gathered information suggests that gross margins are not a relevant metric for JPMorgan Chase, a financial institution. Instead, metrics like net interest margin, ROE, and ROA are more applicable. Therefore, the question about the consistency of JPM's gross margins is not applicable, and the focus should be on the relevant financial metrics for assessing the company's performance."
