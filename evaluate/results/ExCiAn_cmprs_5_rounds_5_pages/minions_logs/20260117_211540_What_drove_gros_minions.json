If gross margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then please state that and explain why.\n\n---\n\nPlease provide succinct advice on the critical information we need to extract from the Financial document. Total length: 522214 characters to answer this question. \n\nAlso consider the following constraints:\n- In your response do NOT use numbered lists.\n- Do NOT structure your response as a sequence of steps.\n",
      "output": "To address the question about what drove the gross margin change for Johnson & Johnson (JnJ) as of FY2022, focus on extracting key financial data and commentary from the document. Look for sections that discuss revenue, cost of goods sold (COGS), and any specific factors impacting these figures, such as changes in product mix, pricing strategies, or cost efficiencies. Pay attention to management's discussion and analysis, as it often provides insights into operational performance and strategic decisions that affect gross margin.\n\nIf gross margin is not a useful metric for JnJ, consider the nature of the company's business. JnJ operates in the healthcare sector, which includes pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and consumer health products. In such a diversified company, gross margin might be influenced by varying factors across different segments. It may be more insightful to analyze segment-specific margins or other profitability metrics like operating margin or net profit margin, which can provide a clearer picture of overall financial health and performance.\n\nIn summary, focus on revenue and COGS details, management's analysis, and consider the relevance of gross margin in the context of JnJ's diversified operations."

Instead, you can assign small, isolated tasks to a less capable worker model that sees only a single chunk of text at a time.

Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 12 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`.

Management and representatives of Johnson &\nJohnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) also may from time to time make forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements do not relate strictly\nto historical or current facts and reflect management’s assumptions, views, plans, objectives and projections about the future. Forward-looking statements\nmay be identified by the use of words such as “plans,” “expects,” “will,” “anticipates,” “estimates” and other words of similar meaning in conjunction with,\namong other things: discussions of future operations; expected operating results and financial performance; impact of planned acquisitions and\ndispositions; impact and timing of restructuring initiatives, including associated cost savings and other benefits; the planned separation of the Company’s\nConsumer Health business; the Company’s strategy for growth; product development activities; regulatory approvals; market position and expenditures.\nBecause forward-looking statements are based on current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding future events, they are subject to\nuncertainties, risks and changes that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of the Company’s control. Investors should realize that if\nunderlying assumptions prove inaccurate, or known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, the Company’s actual results and financial condition\ncould vary materially from expectations and projections expressed or implied in its forward-looking statements. Investors are therefore cautioned not to\nrely on these forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to:\nRisks Related to Product Development, Market Success and Competition\n•\nChallenges and uncertainties inherent in innovation and development of new and improved products and technologies on which the Company’s\ncontinued growth and success depend, including uncertainty of clinical outcomes, additional analysis of existing clinical data, obtaining regulatory\napprovals, health plan coverage and customer access, and initial and continued commercial success;\n•\nChallenges to the Company’s ability to obtain and protect adequate patent and other intellectual property rights for new and existing products and\ntechnologies in the United States and other important markets;\n•\nThe impact of patent expirations, typically followed by the introduction of competing generic, biosimilar or other products and resulting revenue\nand market share losses;\n•\nIncreasingly aggressive and frequent challenges to the Company’s patents by competitors and others seeking to launch competing generic,\nbiosimilar or other produc",

The products sold in international business include those developed in the U.S. and by subsidiaries abroad.\nInvestments and activities in some countries outside the U.S. are subject to higher risks than comparable U.S. activities because the investment and\ncommercial climate may be influenced by financial instability in international economies, restrictive economic policies and political and legal system\nuncertainties.\nRaw Materials\n    Raw materials essential to the Company's business are generally readily available from multiple sources. Where there are exceptions, the temporary\nunavailability of those raw materials would not likely have a material adverse effect on the financial results of the Company.\nPatents\n    The Company's subsidiaries have made a practice of obtaining patent protection on their products and processes where possible. They own, or are\nlicensed under, a significant number of patents in the U.S. and other countries relating to their products, product uses, formulations and manufacturing\nprocesses, which in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance to the Company in the operation of its businesses. The Company’s subsidiaries\nface patent challenges from third parties, including challenges seeking to manufacture and market generic and biosimilar versions of the Company's key\npharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products.

These trademarks are protected by registration in the U.S. and other countries where such products are marketed. The Company considers\nthese trademarks in the aggregate to be of material importance in the operation of its businesses.\nSeasonality\n    Worldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality; however, spending has typically been heavier in the fourth quarter of each year than\nin other quarters. This reflects increased spending decisions, principally for advertising and research and development activity.\nCompetition\n    In all of their product lines, the Company's subsidiaries compete with companies both locally and globally. Competition exists in all product lines\nwithout regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved. Competition in research, both internally and externally sourced, involving the\ndevelopment and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant.

Laws and regulations have been enacted to require adherence to strict compliance standards and prevent\nfraud and abuse in the healthcare industry.

The Company also competes with other market participants in securing rights to\nacquisitions, collaborations and licensing agreements with third parties. Competition for rights to product candidates and technologies may result in\nsignificant investment and acquisition costs and onerous agreement terms for the Company. Competitors’ development of more effective or less costly\nproducts, and/or their ability to secure patent and other intellectual property rights and successfully market products ahead of the Company, could\nnegatively impact sales of the Company’s existing products as well as its ability to bring new products to market despite significant prior investment in the\nrelated product development.\nFor the Company’s Pharmaceutical businesses, loss of patent exclusivity for a product often is followed by a substantial reduction in sales as competitors\ngain regulatory approval for generic and other competing products and enter the market. Similar competition can be triggered by the loss of exclusivity for\na biological product.

This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the Company’s\nConsolidated Statement of Earnings. The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the countries where it operates. Changes to tax laws or\nregulations may occur at any time, and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is\nenacted.\nSee Note 8, “Income Taxes” under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report for additional information.\nThe Company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and is addressing tax audits and disputes with many tax authorities. In\nconnection with various government initiatives, companies are required to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world,\nwhich may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in other countries. The Company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of its tax audits and\ndisputes to determine the appropriateness of its tax reserves. However, any tax authority could take a position on tax treatment that is contrary to the\nCompany’s expectations, which could result in tax liabilities in excess of reserves.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nThe Company faces increased challenges to intellectual property rights central to its business.\nThe Company owns or licenses a significant number of patents and other proprietary rights relating to its products and manufacturing processes.

The Company cannot be certain that it will obtain adequate patent protection\nfor new products and technologies in the United States and other important markets or that such protections, once granted, will last as long as originally\nanticipated.\nCompetitors routinely challenge the validity or extent of the Company’s owned or licensed patents and proprietary rights through litigation, interferences,\noppositions and other proceedings, such as inter partes review (IPR) proceedings before the United States Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO).

In the U.S., manufacturers of generic\nversions of innovative human pharmaceutical products may challenge the validity, or claim non-infringement, of innovator products through the\nAbbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, process with the U.S. FDA and related ANDA litigation. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation\nAct (BPCIA), enacted in 2010, which created a new regulatory pathway for the approval by the U.S. FDA of biosimilar alternatives to innovator-developed\nbiological products, also created mechanisms for biosimilar applicants to challenge the patents on the innovator biologics. The IPR process with the\nUSPTO is also being used by competitors to challenge patents asserted in litigation.\nIn the event the Company is not successful in defending its patents against such challenges, or upon the “at-risk” launch by the generic or biosimilar firm of\nits product, the Company can lose a major portion of revenues for the referenced product in a very short period of time.

New products or enhancements to existing products may not be accepted quickly or significantly in the\nmarketplace due to product and price competition, changes in customer preferences or healthcare purchasing patterns, resistance by healthcare providers or\nuncertainty over third-party reimbursement. Even following initial regulatory approval, the success of a product can be adversely impacted by safety and\nefficacy findings in larger real-world patient populations, as well as market entry of competitive products.\nRisks Related to Financial and Economic Market Conditions\nThe Company faces a variety of financial, economic, legal, social and political risks associated with conducting business internationally.\nThe Company’s extensive operations and business activity throughout the world are accompanied by certain financial, economic, legal, social and political\nrisks, including those listed below.\nForeign Currency Exchange: In fiscal 2022, approximately 49% of the Company’s sales occurred outside of the U.S., with approximately 25% in Europe,\n6% in the Western Hemisphere, excluding the U.S., and 18% in the Asia-Pacific and Africa region. Changes in non-U.S. currencies relative to the U.S.\ndollar impact the Company’s revenues and expenses. While the Company uses financial instruments to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in currency\nexchange rates on its cash flows, unhedged exposures continue to be subject to currency fluctuations. In addition, the weakening or strengthening of the\nU.S. dollar may result in significant favorable or unfavorable translation effects when the operating results of the Company’s non-U.S. business activity are\ntranslated into U.S. dollars.\nInflation and Currency Devaluation Risks: The Company faces challenges in maintaining profitability of operations in economies experiencing high\ninflation rates. Specifically, the Company has accounted for operations in Argentina, Turkey and Venezuela as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year\ncumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%.

With the exception of limited quantities of prescription drugs for personal use, foreign imports of pharmaceutical products are illegal\nunder current U.S. law. However, the volume of illegal imports continues to rise as the ability of patients and other customers to obtain the lower-priced\nimports has grown significantly.\nAnti-Bribery and Other Regulations: The Company is subject to various federal and foreign laws that govern its international business practices with\nrespect to payments to government officials. Those laws include the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which prohibits U.S. publicly traded\ncompanies from promising, offering, or giving anything of value to foreign officials with the corrupt intent of influencing the foreign official for the\npurpose of helping the Company obtain or retain business or gain any improper advantage. The Company’s business is heavily regulated and therefore\ninvolves significant interaction with foreign officials. Also, in many countries outside the U.S., the healthcare providers who prescribe human\npharmaceuticals are employed by the government and the purchasers of human pharmaceuticals are government entities; therefore, the Company’s\ninteractions with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the FCPA. In addition to the U.S. application and enforcement of the\nFCPA, various jurisdictions in which the Company operates have laws\n12\n\n\nand regulations, including the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, aimed at preventing and penalizing corrupt and anticompetitive behavior.

The anticipated benefits of the planned\nseparation are based on a number of assumptions, some of which may prove incorrect.\nFollowing the planned separation, the price of shares of the Company’s common stock may fluctuate significantly.\nThe Company cannot predict the effect of the planned separation on the trading price of shares of its common stock, and the market value of shares of its\ncommon stock may be less than, equal to or greater than the market value of shares of its common stock prior to the planned separation. In addition, the\nprice of the Company’s common stock may be more volatile around the time of the planned separation.\nThe planned separation could result in substantial tax liability.\nThe Company has received a private letter ruling from the IRS as to the tax-free nature of the planned separation under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of\n1986, as amended. The planned separation is conditioned on, among other things, the continuing effectiveness and validity of the Company's private letter\nruling from the IRS and receipt of favorable opinions of the Company's U.S. tax advisors. The private letter ruling and opinions will be based on, among\nother things, various facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from the Company and Kenvue regarding the past and future conduct of the\ncompanies’ respective businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are incorrect or not otherwise\nsatisfied, the Company and its shareholders may not be able to rely on the ruling or the opinions of tax advisors. Notwithstanding the private letter ruling\nand opinions of tax advisors, if subsequent to the planned separation the IRS determines that certain steps of the transaction do not qualify for tax-free\ntreatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the resulting tax liability to the Company and its shareholders could be substantial. The planned separation\nmay also not qualify for tax-free treatment in other countries around the world, and as a result may trigger substantial tax liability to the Company.\nOther Risks\nOur business depends on our ability to recruit and retain talented, highly skilled employees a",

These key accounting policies include revenue\nrecognition, income taxes, legal and self-insurance contingencies, valuation of long-lived assets, assumptions used to determine the amounts recorded for\npensions and other employee benefit plans and accounting for stock based awards.\nRevenue Recognition: The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are\nsatisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to customers. The Company's global payment terms are typically between 30 to 90\ndays.

The Company’s sales returns reserves are accounted for in\naccordance with the U.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns reserves are recorded at full sales value. Sales\nreturns in the Consumer Health and Pharmaceutical segments are almost exclusively not resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the MedTech\nsegment are typically resalable but are not material. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products. The sales returns\nreserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0% of annual net trade sales during the fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nPromotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in the same period as related sales.\nContinuing promotional programs include coupons and volume-based sales incentive programs. The redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on\nhistorical redemption experience by product and value. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for the incentive period\nand are recorded as products are sold. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a reduction of\nrevenue. The Company also earns profit-share payments through collaborative arrangements of certain products, which are included in sales to customers.\nProfit-share payments were less than 2.0% of the total revenues in fiscal year 2022 and less than 3.0% of the total revenues in fiscal years 2021 and 2020\nand are included in sales to customers.\nIn addition, the Company enters into collaboration arrangements that contain multiple revenue generating activities. Amounts due from collaborative\npartners for these arrangements are recognized as each activity is performed or delivered, based on the relative selling price. Upfront fees received as part\nof these arrangements are deferred and recognized over the performance period.

The fair values for the earnings per share goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using\nthe fair market value of the shares at the time of the award, discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the performance share units during the vesting\nperiod. The fair value for the relative total shareholder return goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo\nvaluation model.

The Company continues to\nmonitor these situations and take appropriate actions. Inflation rates continue to have an effect on worldwide economies and, consequently, on the way\ncompanies operate.

Intercompany accounts and\ntransactions are eliminated. Columns and rows within tables may not add due to rounding. Percentages have been calculated using actual, non-rounded\nfigures.\nDescription of the Company and Business Segments\nThe Company has approximately 152,700 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of\nproducts in the healthcare field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world and its primary focus is on products related to\nhuman health and well-being.\nThe Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer Health, Pharmaceutical and MedTech. The Consumer Health segment includes a\nbroad range of products used in the Baby Care, Oral Care, Skin Health/Beauty, Over-the-Counter pharmaceutical, Women’s Health and Wound Care\nmarkets. These products are marketed to the general public and sold online (eCommerce) and to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world. The\nPharmaceutical segment is focused on the following therapeutic areas, including Immunology, Infectious diseases, Neuroscience, Oncology, Pulmonary\nHypertension, and Cardiovascular and Metabolic diseases. Products in this segment are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, distributors, hospitals\nand healthcare professionals for prescription use. The MedTech segment includes a broad portfolio of products used in the Orthopaedic, Surgery,\nInterventional Solutions (cardiovascular and neurovascular) and Vision fields. These products are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and\nused principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics.\nIn November 2021, the Company announced its intention to separate the Company’s Consumer Health business (Kenvue as the name for the planned\nNew Consumer Health Company), with the intention to create a new, publicly traded company by the end of the fiscal year 2023.\nNew Accounting Standards\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nThere were no new material accounting standards adopted in fiscal 2022.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nNot Adopted as of January 1, 2023\nASU 2022-04: Liabilities-Supplier Finance Programs (Topic 405-50) – Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations\nThis update requires that a buyer in a supplier finance program disclose additional information about the program to allow financial statement users to\nbetter understand the effect of the programs on an entity’s working capital, liquidity, and cash flows. This update will be effective for the Company for\nfiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, except for the amendment on roll forward information, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after\nDecember 15, 2023.

The Company has a policy\nof making investments only with commercial institutions that have at least an investment grade credit rating. The Company invests its cash primarily in\ngovernment securities and obligations, corporate debt securities, money market funds and reverse repurchase agreements (RRAs).\nRRAs are collateralized by deposits in the form of Government Securities and Obligations for an amount not less than 102% of their value. The\nCompany does not record an asset or liability as the Company is not permitted to sell or repledge the associated collateral. The Company has a policy that\nthe collateral has at least an A (or equivalent) credit rating. The Company utilizes a third party custodian to manage the exchange of funds and ensure that\ncollateral received is maintained at 102% of the value of the RRAs on a daily basis. RRAs with stated maturities of greater than three months from the date\nof purchase are classified as marketable securities.\nInvestments\nInvestments classified as held to maturity investments are reported at amortized cost and realized gains or losses are reported in earnings. Investments\nclassified as available-for-sale debt securities are carried at estimated fair value with unrealized gains and\n46\n\n\nlosses recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Available-for-sale securities available for current operations are classified as\ncurrent assets otherwise, they are classified as long term. Management determines the appropriate classification of its investment in debt and equity\nsecurities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates such determination at each balance sheet date. The Company reviews its investments for impairment and\nadjusts these investments to fair value through earnings, as required. \nProperty, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost. The Company utilizes the straight-line method of depreciation over the estimated useful lives of the assets:\nBuilding and building equipment\n30 years\nLand and leasehold improvements\n10 - 20 years\nMachinery and equipment\n2 - 13 years\nThe Company capitalizes certain computer software and development costs, included in machinery and equipment, when incurred in connection with\ndeveloping or obtaining computer software for internal use. Capitalized software costs are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the software, which\ngenerally range from 3 to 8 years.\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets to assess recoverability using undiscounted cash flows.

If the asset is\ndetermined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset’s fair value and its carrying value. If quoted market prices are not\navailable, the Company will estimate fair value using a discounted value of estimated future cash flows.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied; generally, this occurs\nwith the transfer of control of the goods to customers. The Company's global payment terms are typically between 30 to 90 days. Provisions for certain\nrebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns, discounts to customers and governmental clawback provisions are accounted for as\nvariable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales. The liability is recognized within Accrued Rebates, Returns, and Promotions on the\nconsolidated balance sheet.\nProduct discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants, as well as market conditions,\nincluding consideration of competitor pricing. Rebates are estimated based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and\nprojected market conditions in the various markets served. A significant portion of the liability related to rebates is from the sale of the Company's\npharmaceutical products within the U.S., primarily the Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid programs, which amounted to $9.6 billion and $7.7 billion\nas of January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022, respectively. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through\nthe analysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated information.\nSales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to\ndating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals.\nSales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in the field, or in specific areas, product\nrecall. The sales returns reserve is based on historical return trends by product and by market as a percent to gross sales. In accordance with the Company’s\naccounting policies, the Company generally issues credit to customers for returned goods. The Company’s sales returns reserves are accounted for in\naccordance with the U.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns reserves are recorded at full sales value. Sales\nreturns in the Consumer Health and Pharmaceutical segments are almost exclusively not resalable. Sales returns for certai",

The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products. The sales returns\nreserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0% of annual net trade sales during each of the fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nPromotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in the same period as related sales.\nContinuing promotional programs include coupons and volume-based sales incentive programs. The redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on\nhistorical redemption experience by product and value. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for the incentive period\nand are recorded as products are sold. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a reduction of\nrevenue. The Company also earns profit-share payments through collaborative arrangements for certain products, which are included in sales to customers.\nProfit-share payments were less than 2.0% of the total revenues in fiscal year 2022 and less than 3.0% of the total revenues in fiscal years 2021 and 2020\nand are included in sales to customers.\n47\n\n\nSee Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further disaggregation of revenue.\nShipping and Handling\nShipping and handling costs incurred were $1.1 billion, $1.1 billion and $1.0 billion in fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and are included in\nselling, marketing and administrative expense. The amount of revenue received for shipping and handling is less than 1.0% of sales to customers for all\nperiods presented.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value determined by the first-in, first-out method.\nIntangible Assets and Goodwill\nThe authoritative literature on U.S. GAAP requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives be assessed annually for impairment. The\nCompany completed its annual impairment test for 2022 in the fiscal fourth quarter. Future impairment tests will be performed annually in the fiscal fourth\nquarter, or sooner if warranted.

Fair value is a market-based measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in\npricing an asset or liability. The authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value, with Level 1\nhaving the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other\ncomprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction.\nThe Company documents all relationships between hedged items and derivatives. The overall risk management strategy includes reasons for\nundertaking hedge transactions and entering into derivatives. The objectives of this strategy are: (1) minimize foreign currency exposure’s impact on the\nCompany’s financial performance; (2) protect the Company’s cash flow from adverse movements in foreign exchange rates; (3) ensure the appropriateness\nof financial instruments; and (4) manage the enterprise risk associated with financial institutions. See Note 6 for additional information on Financial\nInstruments.\nLeases\nThe Company determines whether an arrangement is a lease at contract inception by establishing if the contract conveys the right to control the use of\nidentified property, plant, or equipment for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Right of Use (ROU) Assets and Lease Liabilities for operating\nleases are included in Other assets, Accrued liabilities, and Other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. The ROU Assets represent the right to use an\nunderlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent an obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Commitments under finance\nleases are not significant, and are included in Property, plant and equipment, Loans and notes payable, and Long-term debt on the consolidated balance\nsheet.\nROU Assets and Lease Liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of all minimum lease payments over the\nlease term. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of\nlease payments, when the implicit rate is not readily determinable. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease. These options are\nincluded in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line\nbasis over the lease term. The Company has elected the following policy elections on adoption: use of portfolio approach on leases of assets under master\nservice agreements, exclusion of short term leases on the balance sheet, and not separating lease and non-lease components.\nThe Company primarily has operating lease for space, vehi",

Cash paid for amounts\nincluded in the measurement of lease liabilities were $0.3 billion in fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nProduct Liability\nAccruals for product liability claims are recorded, on an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the\nliability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information and actuarially determined estimates where applicable. The accruals are adjusted\nperiodically as additional information becomes available.

In addition to accruals in the self insurance program, claims that\nexceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses are expensed as incurred in accordance with ASC 730, Research and Development. Upfront and milestone payments\nmade to third parties in connection with research and development collaborations are expensed as incurred up to the point of regulatory approval.

These collaborations usually involve various activities by\none or more parties, including research and development, marketing and selling and distribution.

The TCJA included a provision for a tax on all previously\n49\n\n\nundistributed earnings of U.S. companies located in foreign jurisdictions. Undistributed earnings in the form of cash and cash equivalents were taxed at a\nrate of 15.5% and all other earnings were taxed at a rate of 8.0%. This tax is payable over 8 years and will not accrue interest. These payments began in\n2018 and will continue through 2025. The remaining balance at the end of the 2022 was approximately $6.1 billion, of which $4.6 billion is classified as\nnoncurrent and reflected as “Long-term taxes payable” on the Company’s balance sheet. The balance of this account is related to receivables from tax\nauthorities not expected to be received in the next 12 months.\nThe TCJA also includes provisions for a tax on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI). GILTI is described as the excess of a U.S. shareholder’s\ntotal net foreign income over a deemed return on tangible assets, as provided by the TCJA. In January 2018, the FASB issued guidance that allows\ncompanies to elect as an accounting policy whether to record the tax effects of GILTI in the period the tax liability is generated (i.e., “period cost”) or\nprovide for deferred tax assets and liabilities related to basis differences that exist and are expected to effect the amount of GILTI inclusion in future years\nupon reversal (i.e., “deferred method”). The Company has elected to account for GILTI under the deferred method. The deferred tax amounts recorded are\nbased on the evaluation of temporary differences that are expected to reverse as GILTI is incurred in future periods.\nThe Company has recorded deferred tax liabilities on all undistributed earnings prior to December 31, 2017 from its international subsidiaries. The\nCompany has not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings subsequent to January 1, 2018 from certain international subsidiaries where the\nearnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. The Company intends to continue to reinvest these earnings in those international operations. If the\nCompany decides at a later date to repatriate these earnings to the U.S., the Company would be required to provide for the net tax effects on these amounts.\nThe Company estimates that the tax effect of this repatriation would be approximately $0.5 billion under currently enacted tax laws and regulations and at\ncurrent currency exchange rates. This amount does not include the possible benefit of U.S. foreign tax credits, which may substantially offset this cost.\nSee Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes.\nNet Earnings Per Share\nBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares\noutstanding for the period.

Estimates are used when accounting for sales discounts, rebates, allowances and incentives,\nproduct liabilities, income taxes, withholding taxes, depreciation, amortization, employee benefits, contingencies and intangible asset and liability\nvaluations. Actual results may or may not differ from those estimates.\nThe Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies.

Both types of derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges.\nAdditionally, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps as an instrument to manage interest rate risk related to fixed rate borrowings. These\nderivatives are designated as fair value hedges. The Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts designated as\nnet investment hedges. Additionally, the Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to offset its exposure to certain foreign currency assets and\nliabilities. These forward foreign exchange contracts are not designated as hedges and therefore, changes in the fair values of these derivatives are\nrecognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the related foreign currency assets and liabilities.\nIn the fiscal fourth quarter of 2022, the Company entered into forward starting interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling $2.4 billion in\ncontemplation of hedging interest rate risk associated with long-term financing for the Consumer Health segment separation.

As of January 2,\n2022, the Company had notional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange contracts, cross currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps of\n$45.8 billion, $37.4 billion and $10.0 billion, respectively.\nAll derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current\nearnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge\ntransaction.\nThe designation as a cash flow hedge is made at the entrance date of the derivative contract. At inception, all derivatives are expected to be highly\neffective. Foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges are accounted for under the forward method and all gains/losses associated with these\ncontracts will be recognized in the income statement when the hedged item impacts earnings. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in\naccumulated other comprehensive income until the underlying transaction affects earnings, and are then reclassified to earnings in the same account as the\nhedged transaction.\nGains and losses associated with interest rate swaps and changes in fair value of hedged debt attributable to changes in interest rates are recorded to\ninterest expense in the period in which they occur. Gains and losses on net investment hedges are accounted through the currency translation account within\naccumulated other comprehensive income. The portion excluded from effectiveness testing is recorded through interest (income) expense using the spot\nmethod. On an ongoing basis, the Company assesses whether each derivative continues to be highly effective in offsetting changes of hedged items. If and\nwhen a derivative is no longer expected to be highly effective, hedge accounting is discontinued.\nThe Company designated its Euro denominated notes issued in May 2016 with due dates ranging from 2022 to 2035 as a net investment hedge of the\nCompany's investments in certain of its international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional currency in order to reduce the volatility caused by\nchanges in exchange rates.\nAs of January 1, 2023, the balance of deferred net loss on derivatives included in accumulated other comprehensive income was $230 million after-tax.\nFor additional information, see the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and Note 13. The Company expects that substantially all of the\namounts related to forward foreign exchange contracts will be reclassified into earnings over the next 12 months as a result of transactions that are expected\nto occur over that period. The maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging transaction exposure is 18 months, excluding interest rate\ncontracts and net investment",

Fair value is based upon quoted market prices, where available. If\nlisted prices or quotes are not available, fair value is based upon models that primarily use, as inputs, market-based or independently sourced market\nparameters, including yield curves, interest rates, volatilities, equity or debt prices, foreign exchange rates and credit curves.\nWhile the Plan believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or\nassumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.\nValuation Hierarchy\nThe authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels within the hierarchy are\ndescribed in the table below with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest.\nThe Net Asset Value (NAV) is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus its liabilities, and then divided by the number of shares\noutstanding.\nA financial instrument’s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value\nmeasurement.\nFollowing is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the investments measured at fair value.\n•\nShort-term investment funds — Cash and quoted short-term instruments are valued at the closing price or the amount held on deposit by the\ncustodian bank. Other investments are through investment vehicles valued using the NAV provided by the administrator of the fund. The NAV is a\nquoted price in a market that is not active and classified as Level 2.\n•\nGovernment and agency securities — A limited number of these investments are valued at the closing price reported on the major market on\nwhich the individual securities are traded. Where quoted prices are available in an active market, the investments are classified within Level 1 of\nthe valuation hierarchy.

This equity account\nincludes the results of translating certain balance sheet assets and liabilities at current exchange rates and some accounts at historical rates, except for those\nlocated in highly inflationary economies, (Argentina and Venezuela). Beginning in the fiscal second quarter of 2022, the Company also accounted for\noperations in Turkey as highly inflationary. The translation of balance sheet accounts for highly inflationary economies are reflected in the operating\nresults.\nA rollforward of the changes during fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020 for foreign currency translation adjustments is included in Note 13.\nNet currency transaction gains and losses included in Other (income) expense were losses of $328 million, $236 million and $209 million in fiscal\nyears 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n15.

As of January 1, 2023, the Company has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are\nprobable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal issue and adjust\naccruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance with ASC 450-20-25. For these and other litigation and\nregulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss\nbeyond the amounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and\nuncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be\naffected by various factors including, among other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and\nlegal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in\ndispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and unpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-\nparty settlements; complexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. To the extent adverse awards,\njudgments or verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can\nbe reasonably estimated.\nIn the Company’s opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with counsel, the ultimate outcome of legal\nproceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company’s balance sheet, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial\nposition.

The Edley Class Action asserts, among other things, that the Company fraudulently defended past asbestos personal injury lawsuits arising from\nexposure to industrial talc mined, milled, and manufactured before January 6, 1989 by the Company’s then wholly owned subsidiary, Windsor Minerals,\nInc., which is currently a debtor in the Imerys Bankruptcy described hereafter. The Company removed the Edley Class Action to federal court in the\nDistrict of New Jersey. In July 2022, Imerys filed a motion in the Imerys Bankruptcy to stay the Edley Class Action, which was denied in August 2022. In\nOctober 2022, the Company filed motions to dismiss and to deny certification of a class to pursue the Edley Class Action in the New Jersey District Court.\nIn February 2019, the Company’s talc supplier, Imerys Talc America, Inc. and two of its affiliates, Imerys Talc Vermont, Inc. and Imerys Talc Canada, Inc.\n(collectively, Imerys) filed a voluntary petition under chapter 11 of the United States Code (the Bankruptcy Code) in the United States Bankruptcy Court\nfor the District of Delaware (Imerys Bankruptcy). The Imerys Bankruptcy relates to Imerys’s potential liability for personal injury from exposure to talcum\npowder sold by Imerys. In its bankruptcy, Imerys alleges it has claims against the Company for indemnification and rights to joint insurance proceeds. In\nMay 2020, Imerys, its parent Imerys S.A., the Tort Claimants’ Committee (TCC), and the Future Claimants’ Representative (FCR) (collectively, the Plan\nProponents) filed their Plan of Reorganization (the Plan) and the Disclosure Statement related\n87\n\n\nthereto.

In April 2021, the Plan Proponents announced\nthe Plan had received the requisite number of accepting votes to confirm the Plan. The Company challenged certain improprieties with respect to portions\nof the vote and sought to disqualify those votes.

The most recent term of the mediation\nended on December 31, 2022.\nIn July 2021, Imerys commenced an adversary proceeding against the Company in the Imerys Bankruptcy (the Imerys Adversary Proceeding). The Imerys\nAdversary Proceeding sought, among other things, certain declarations with respect to the indemnification obligations allegedly owed by the Company to\nImerys. The TCC and FCR simultaneously filed a motion for temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin the Company from\nundergoing a corporate restructuring that would separate the Company’s talc liabilities from its other assets. The Bankruptcy Court denied the motion. The\nCompany thereafter filed a motion to dismiss the adversary proceeding. The Bankruptcy Court has not yet decided the motion to dismiss.

To the extent adverse awards,\njudgments, or verdicts have been rendered against the Company, management does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can\nbe reasonably estimated. For these matters, management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts accrued. Amounts\naccrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and\nassumptions including timing of related payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors, including, among\nother things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not\ncomplete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the\nuncertainty and unpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements; complexity of related cross-\nclaims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. Management continues to believe that the Company has strong legal grounds to\ncontest the talc verdicts it has appealed. Notwithstanding management’s confidence in the safety of the Company’s talc products, in certain circumstances\nthe Company has settled cases. In October 2021, Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc.

The LTL Bankruptcy Case was transferred to the\nUnited States Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey in November 2021, and that court extended the PI through the end of\n104\n\n\nFebruary 2022.

      "output": "From the collected outputs, we have gathered several pieces of information related to Johnson & Johnson's gross margin changes for FY2022:\n\n1. **Revenue and Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):**\n   - Overall revenue increased from $93,775 million in 2021 to $94,943 million in 2022.\n   - COGS increased from $29,855 million in 2021 to $31,089 million in 2022.\n   - Specific segments like Pharmaceuticals and MedTech experienced revenue increases, but COGS details are less specific.\n\n2. **Factors Affecting Gross Margin:**\n   - One-time COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing exit costs.\n   - Currency impacts in the Pharmaceutical segment.\n   - Commodity inflation in the MedTech and Consumer Health segments.\n   - Supply chain benefits in the Consumer Health segment.\n\n3. **Gross Margin Changes:**\n   - Gross margin percentage changes were noted in various segments, such as a decrease in the Infectious Diseases segment.\n\n4. **Additional Financial Impacts:**\n   - A pre-tax charge of $0.5 billion was recorded, affecting restructuring and cost of products sold.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Sufficiency of Information:**\n   - The information is somewhat sufficient to understand the factors driving gross margin changes. We have data on revenue and COGS, as well as qualitative factors affecting these metrics.\n\n2. **Missing Information:**\n   - Specific gross margin percentages for each segment are not consistently provided.\n   - Detailed breakdowns of COGS for each segment would help in understanding the precise impact on gross margins.\n\n3. **Deriving the Answer:**\n   - To calculate the gross margin, we would use the formula: \\(\\text{Gross Margin} = \\frac{\\text{Revenue} - \\text{COGS}}{\\text{Revenue}} \\times 100\\%\\).\n   - The increase in COGS relative to revenue suggests a potential decrease in gross margin percentage, which aligns with the qualitative factors mentioned.\n\n4. **Conflicting Information:**\n   - There are no major conflicts in the data provided, but the lack of specific COGS details for each segment limits precision.\n\nIn conclusion, while we have a general understanding of the factors affecting JnJ's gross margin changes, more detailed financial data would provide a clearer picture. The qualitative factors such as COVID-19 related costs and currency impacts are significant contributors to the changes observed."

Similar trends are also evident in major markets outside of the U.S. The new medical device\nregulatory framework and the evolving privacy, data localization, and emerging cyber security laws and regulations around the world are examples of such\nincreased regulation.

Litigation, in general, and securities, derivative action, class action and multi-district\nlitigation, in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. Some of these matters may include thousands of plaintiffs, may involve parties seeking large\nand/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved for several years. For example, the Company is a\ndefendant in numerous lawsuits arising out of the use of body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S Baby Powder, and the Company’s sale,\nmanufacturing and marketing of opioids. While the Company believes it has substantial defenses in these matters, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate\noutcome of litigation. The Company could in the future be required to pay significant amounts as a result of settlements or judgments in these matters,\npotentially in excess of accruals, including matters where the Company could be held jointly and severally liable among other defendants. The resolution\nof, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of\noperations and cash flows for that period.

Accordingly, the Company enters into\nforward foreign exchange contracts to protect the value of certain foreign currency assets and liabilities and to hedge future foreign currency transactions\nprimarily related to product costs. Gains or losses on these contracts are offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions. A 10% appreciation of\nthe U.S. Dollar from the January 1, 2023 market rates would increase the unrealized value of the Company’s forward contracts by $0.1 billion. Conversely,\na 10% depreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the January 1, 2023 market rates would decrease the unrealized value of the Company’s forward contracts by\n$0.1 billion. In either scenario, the gain or loss on the forward contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore,\nwould have no impact on future anticipated earnings and cash flows.\nThe Company hedges the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and the effect on certain assets and liabilities in foreign currency, by\nentering into currency swap contracts. A 1% change in the spread between U.S. and foreign interest rates on the Company’s interest rate sensitive financial\ninstruments would either increase or dec",

The new cantonal tax\nparameters include favorable tax benefits for patents and additional research and development tax deductions. The cantonal transitional provisions of TRAF\nallowed companies to elect either 1) tax basis step-up similar to the Federal transition benefit or 2) alternative statutory tax rate for a period not to exceed 5\nyears. The Company has operations located in various Swiss cantons.\nDuring the fiscal year 2020, the final canton where the Company maintains significant operations enacted TRAF legislation. Additionally, the Company\nreceived rulings from the Swiss Federal and cantonal tax authorities in the remaining jurisdictions where it has significant operations.

Fair value is based upon quoted market prices, where available. If\nlisted prices or quotes are not available, fair value is based upon models that primarily use, as inputs, market-based or independently sourced market\nparameters, including yield curves, interest rates, volatilities, equity or debt prices, foreign exchange rates and credit curves.\nWhile the Plan believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or\nassumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.\nValuation Hierarchy\nThe authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels within the hierarchy are\ndescribed in the table below with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest.\nThe Net Asset Value (NAV) is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus its liabilities, and then divided by the number of shares\noutstanding.\nA financial instrument’s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value\nmeasurement.\nFollowing is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the investments measured at fair value.\n•\nShort-term investment funds — Cash and quoted short-term instruments are valued at the closing price or the amount held on deposit by the\ncustodian bank. Other investments are through investment vehicles valued using the NAV provided by the administrator of the fund. The NAV is a\nquoted price in a market that is not active and classified as Level 2.\n•\nGovernment and agency securities — A limited number of these investments are valued at the closing price reported on the major market on\nwhich the individual securities are traded. Where quoted prices are available in an active market, the investments are classified within Level 1 of\nthe valuation hierarchy. If quoted market prices are not available for the specific security, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models,\n",

A majority\nof the Company’s pension funds are open to new entrants and are expected to be on-going plans. Permitted investments are primarily liquid and/or listed,\nwith little reliance on illiquid and non-traditional investments such as hedge funds.\nThe Company’s retirement plan asset allocation at the end of 2022 and 2021 and target allocations for 2023 are as follows:\nPercent of\nPlan Assets\nTarget\nAllocation\n \n2022\n2021\n2023\nWorldwide Retirement Plans\nEquity securities\n62  %\n65  %\n61  %\nDebt securities\n38 \n35 \n39 \nTotal plan assets\n100 %\n100 %\n100 %\nDetermination of Fair Value of Plan Assets\nThe Plan has an established and well-documented process for determining fair values. Fair value is based upon quoted market prices, where available. If\nlisted prices or quotes are not available, fair value is based upon models that primarily use, as inputs, market-based or independently sourced market\nparameters, including yield curves, interest rates, volatilities, equity or debt prices, foreign exchange rates and credit curves.\nWhile the Plan believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or\nassumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.\nValuation Hierarchy\nThe authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels within the hierarchy are\ndescribed in the table below with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest.\nThe Net Asset Value (NAV) is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus its liabilities, and then divided by the number of shares\noutstanding.\nA financial instrument’s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value\nmeasurement.\nFollowing is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the investments measured at fair value.\n•\nShort-term investment funds — Cash and quoted short-term instruments are valued at the closing price or the amount held on deposit by the\ncustodian bank. Other investments are through investment vehicles valued using the NAV provided by the administrator of the fund. The NAV is a\nquoted price in a market that is not active and classified as Level 2.\n•\nGovernment and agency securities — A limited number of these investments are valued at the closing price reported on the major market on\nwhich the individual securities are traded. Where quoted prices are available in an active market, the investments are classified within Level 1 of\nthe valuation hierarchy. If quoted market prices are not available for the specific security, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models,\n",

The total income tax benefit recognized in the income statement for share-based compensation costs was $196 million,\n$218 million and $210 million for fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Company also recognized additional income tax benefits of\n$282 million, $223 million and $248 million for fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, for which options were exercised or restricted shares were\nvested.

Imerys, the TCC, the FCR, certain of Imerys’s insurers, and certain parties in the\nCyprus Mines chapter 11 case (described below) (collectively the Mediation Parties) agreed to engage in mediation. The most recent term of the mediation\nended on December 31, 2022.\nIn July 2021, Imerys commenced an adversary proceeding against the Company in the Imerys Bankruptcy (the Imerys Adversary Proceeding). The Imerys\nAdversary Proceeding sought, among other things, certain declarations with respect to the indemnification obligations allegedly owed by the Company to\nImerys. The TCC and FCR simultaneously filed a motion for temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin the Company from\nundergoing a corporate restructuring that would separate the Company’s talc liabilities from its other assets. The Bankruptcy Court denied the motion. The\nCompany thereafter filed a motion to dismiss the adversary proceeding. The Bankruptcy Court has not yet decided the motion to dismiss. In October 2021,\nthe Company filed a Notice of Bankruptcy Filing and Stay of Proceedings clarifying that the automatic stay arising upon the filing of the LTL Bankruptcy\nCase should apply to the Imerys Adversary Proceeding.\nIn June 2020, Cyprus Mines Corporation and its parent, Cyprus Amax Minerals Company (CAMC) (together, Cyprus), which had owned certain Imerys\ntalc mines, filed an adversary proceeding against the Company and Imerys in the Imerys Bankruptcy seeking a declaration of indemnity rights under certain\ncontractual agreements (the Cyprus Adversary Proceeding). The Company denies such indemnification is owed, and filed a motion to dismiss the adversary\ncomplaint. In February 2021, Cyprus filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code and filed its Disclosure Statement and\nPlan (the Cyprus Plan). The Cyprus Plan contemplates a settlement with Imerys and talc claimants where Cyprus would make a monetary contribution to a\ntrust established under the Imerys Plan in exchange for an injunction against talc claims asserted against it and certain protected parties.

The LTL Bankruptcy Case was transferred to the\nUnited States Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey in November 2021, and that court extended the PI through the end of\n104\n\n\nFebruary 2022. Claimants filed motions to dismiss the LTL Bankruptcy Case and, following a multiple day hearing, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court\ndenied those motions by order issued in March 2022. The New Jersey Bankruptcy Court simultaneously issued another order extending the stay as to the\nProtected Parties. The claimants subsequently filed notices of appeal as to the denial of the motions to dismiss and the extension of the stay. In May\n2022,the Third Circuit Court of Appeals granted the petitions to appeal. The briefing and oral argument on the appeal were completed in September 2022.\nOn January 30, 2023, the Third Circuit reversed the Bankruptcy Court’s ruling and remanded to the Bankruptcy Court to dismiss the LTL bankruptcy. LTL\nhas filed a petition for rehearing on the decision.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the talc litigation is a critical audit matter are the significant\njudgment by management when assessing the likelihood of a loss being incurred and when determining whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range\nof loss for the future and existing talc claims can be made, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing\nprocedures and evaluating management’s assessment of the loss contingencies associated with this litigation.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated\nfinancial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s evaluation of the talc litigation, including\ncontrols over determining whether a loss is probable and whether the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, as well as financial statement disclosures.\nThese procedures also included, among others, (i) gaining an understanding of the Company’s process around the accounting and reporting for the talc\nlitigation; (ii) discussing the status of significant known actual and potential litigation and the ongoing LTL bankruptcy proceedings with the Company’s in-\nhouse legal counsel, as well as external counsel when deemed necessary; (iii) obtaining and evaluating the letters of audit inquiry with internal and external\nlegal counsel for significant litigation; (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assessment regarding whether an unfavorable outcome is\nreasonably possible or probable and reasonably estim",

We have both quantitative data (revenue and COGS) and qualitative insights (management's discussion and analysis) that explain the changes in gross margin.\n\n3. **Missing Information:**\n   - While we have a good understanding of the factors affecting gross margin, specific numerical impacts of each factor on the gross margin percentage are not detailed. This would help in quantifying the exact impact of each factor.\n\n4. **Deriving the Answer:**\n   - To calculate the gross margin, we use the formula: \\(\\text{Gross Margin} = \\frac{\\text{Revenue} - \\text{COGS}}{\\text{Revenue}} \\times 100\\%\\).\n   - For 2022: \\(\\text{Gross Margin} = \\frac{94,943 - 31,089}{94,943} \\times 100\\% \\approx 67.3\\%\\).\n   - For 2021: \\(\\text{Gross Margin} = \\frac{93,775 - 29,855}{93,775} \\times 100\\% \\approx 68.1\\%\\).\n   - The decrease in gross margin from 68.1% to 67.3% can be attributed to the factors identified, such as increased COGS due to COVID-19 exit costs, currency impacts, and commodity inflation.\n\n5. **Conflicting Answers:**\n   - There are no significant conflicting answers in the gathered information. The citations provided support the extracted data and explanations.\n\nIn conclusion, the gathered information is sufficient to answer the question about what drove the gross margin change for JnJ in FY2022. The decrease in gross margin is primarily due to increased COGS driven by specific factors like COVID-19 exit costs, currency impacts, and commodity inflation, partially offset by supply chain benefits."
