--- Question ---
Has Microsoft increased its debt on balance sheet between FY2023 and the FY2022 period?

--- Predicted Answer ---
The available data does not allow us to determine whether Microsoft's debt increased between FY2022 and FY2023 due to inconsistent and unreliable figures.

--- Ground Truth ---
['No. Microsoft decreased its debt by $2.5bn in FY 2023 vs FY 2022.']
