  "correctness_reasoning": "The predicted answer suggests that 3M has a 'borderline healthy' liquidity profile, which implies a more positive stance than the ground truth answer. The ground truth clearly states 'No,' indicating that the quick ratio needs improvement. The numerical value of 0.96 is consistent, but the qualitative assessment does not align with the ground truth."
