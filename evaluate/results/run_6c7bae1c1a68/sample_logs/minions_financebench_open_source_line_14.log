--- Question ---
Does Adobe have an improving operating margin profile as of FY2022? If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
Adobe's operating margin profile for FY2022 cannot be conclusively determined due to the lack of consistent operating income data and explicit commentary on margin trends. However, it is suggested that operating margin may not be a useful metric for Adobe, given its business model focused on subscription services and significant investments in research and development.

--- Ground Truth ---
['No the operating margins of Adobe have recently declined from 36.8% in FY 2021 to 34.6% in FY2022. A drop by 2.2% in a year.']

--- Correctness Evaluation ---
Is correct: False
Confidence: 0.90
Reasoning: The predicted answer does not match the ground truth. The ground truth clearly states that Adobe's operating margin declined from 36.8% in FY2021 to 34.6% in FY2022, indicating a worsening margin profile. The predicted answer incorrectly suggests that the operating margin cannot be determined and implies that it may not be a useful metric, which contradicts the ground truth.
