--- Question ---
What is Amazon's FY2017 days payable outstanding (DPO)? DPO is defined as: 365 * (average accounts payable between FY2016 and FY2017) / (FY2017 COGS + change in inventory between FY2016 and FY2017). Round your answer to two decimal places. Address the question by using the line items and information shown within the balance sheet and the P&L statement.

--- Predicted Answer ---
Amazon's FY2017 DPO is calculated as follows: DPO = 365 * (average accounts payable) / (COGS + change in inventory) = 365 * $16,242M / ($111,934M + $4,586M) = 365 * $16,242M / $116,520M = 50.85 days.

--- Ground Truth ---
['93.86']

--- Correctness Evaluation ---
Is correct: False
Confidence: 0.90
Reasoning: The predicted answer of 50.85 days is outside the 10% tolerance range of the ground truth answer, which is 93.86 days. The calculation in the predicted answer uses different values for average accounts payable, COGS, and change in inventory than those implied by the ground truth answer.
