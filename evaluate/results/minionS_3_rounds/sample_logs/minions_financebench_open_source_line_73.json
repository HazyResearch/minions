  "correctness_reasoning": "The ground truth states the effective tax rate changed from 20% to 23%, which is a 3 percentage point increase. The predicted answer states a 2.7 percentage point increase. The difference of 0.3 percentage points is outside the 10% tolerance range (0.3 is more than 10% of 3), so the predicted answer is incorrect."
