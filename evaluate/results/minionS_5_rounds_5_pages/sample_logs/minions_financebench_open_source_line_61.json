  "correctness_reasoning": "The predicted answer correctly identifies that there are product/service categories representing more than 20% of Boeing's revenue for FY2022. It mentions Commercial Airplanes, Defense, and Global Services, which align with the ground truth categories of Commercial Airplanes, Defence, and Services. The inclusion of 'Space & Security' is a minor discrepancy but does not affect the correctness of the main conclusion that there are categories exceeding 20% of revenue."
