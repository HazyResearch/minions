--- Question ---
What drove operating margin change as of FY2022 for 3M? If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then please state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
3M's operating margin change in FY2022 was driven by several factors, including increased raw material and logistics costs, special item charges, supply chain disruptions, segment performance declines, foreign currency impacts, restructuring and divestiture actions, and changes in product demand. Extraordinary items such as litigation costs, divestiture-related restructuring actions, and PFAS manufacturing exit costs significantly impacted the margin. The operating income margin decreased from 22.3% in 2021 to 20.8% in 2022. Management's discussion highlights these challenges, particularly the impact of global supply chain issues and geopolitical tensions.

--- Ground Truth ---
['Operating Margin for 3M in FY2022 has decreased by 1.7% primarily due to: \n-Decrease in gross Margin\n-mostly one-off charges including Combat Arms Earplugs litigation, impairment related to exiting PFAS manufacturing, costs related to exiting Russia and divestiture-related restructuring\ncharges']

--- Correctness Evaluation ---
Is correct: True
Confidence: 0.90
Reasoning: The predicted answer aligns with the ground truth by identifying key factors such as litigation costs, divestiture-related restructuring actions, and PFAS manufacturing exit costs as significant drivers of the operating margin change. It also provides additional context about increased raw material costs, supply chain disruptions, and geopolitical tensions, which are reasonable factors to consider. The numerical change in operating margin is within the 10% tolerance range specified in the evaluation rules.
