If working capital is not a useful or relevant metric for this company, then please state that and explain why.\n\n---\n\nPlease provide succinct advice on the critical information we need to extract from the Financial document. Total length: 1017830 characters to answer this question. \n\nAlso consider the following constraints:\n- In your response do NOT use numbered lists.\n- Do NOT structure your response as a sequence of steps.\n",
      "output": "To determine if American Water Works has positive working capital based on FY2022 data, focus on extracting the current assets and current liabilities from the financial statements within the document. Working capital is calculated as current assets minus current liabilities. If the result is positive, the company has positive working capital, indicating it can cover its short-term obligations. If the document suggests that working capital is not a relevant metric, it may be due to the nature of the industry or the company's specific financial structure, such as having stable cash flows or relying on long-term contracts, which might make liquidity less of a concern. Look for any commentary or notes in the financial document that discuss the company's liquidity management or industry-specific financial practices that could provide context on the relevance of working capital for American Water Works."

      "prompt": "# Decomposition Round #1\n\nYou (the supervisor) cannot directly read the document(s). Instead, you can assign small, isolated tasks to a less capable worker model that sees only a single chunk of text at a time. Any cross-chunk or multi-document reasoning must be handled by you.\n\n## Your Job: Write Two Python Functions\n\n### FUNCTION #1: `prepare_jobs(context, prev_job_manifests, prev_job_outputs) -> List[JobManifest]`\n- Break the document(s) into chunks (using the provided chunking function, if needed). Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 12 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`. All **multi-chunk integration** or **global reasoning** is your responsibility here.\n- Return one **aggregated string** suitable for further supervisor inspection.\n\n\n\n## Relevant Pydantic Models\n\nThe following models are already in the global scope. **Do NOT redefine or re-import them.**\n\n### JobManifest Model\n```\nclass JobManifest(BaseModel):\n    chunk: str  # the actual text for the chunk of the document\n    task: str  # the actual task instruction for the small model\n    advice: str  # optional, any additional advice on how to perform the task\n\n    chunk_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    task_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    job_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n\n```\n\n### JobOutput Model\n```\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    citation: Optional[str]\n    answer: Optional[str]\n\n```\n\n## Function Signatures\n```\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        context (List[str]): A list of documents.

Some of these lawsuits have included allegations that infrastructure of certain utilities\ntriggered the natural event that resulted in damage to the property. In some cases, the PUC has allowed certain costs or losses incurred by the utility to be\nrecovered from customers in rates, but in other cases such recovery in rates has been disallowed. Also, the utility may have obtained insurance that could\nrespond to some or all of such losses, although the utility would be at risk for any losses not ultimately subject to rate or insurance recovery or losses that\nexceed the limits of such insurance.\nWater Supply and Wastewater Services\nThe Company’s Regulated Businesses generally own the physical assets used to store, pump, treat and deliver water to its customers and collect, treat,\ntransport and recycle wastewater.

In this regard, the Company continues to focus on the safety of its employees and\ncontractors so that they may return home from work in the same, or better, condition than when they arrived. The Company strives for all employees to feel\nemotionally safe, live a healthy lifestyle and be physically safe at work and at home. The Company assesses occupational health and safety to measure\nperformance across the entire organization, with the ultimate goal of achieving zero incidents, injuries and fatalities for the Company’s employees and\ncontractors.\nTo uphold the Company’s commitment to safety, the Company’s employees completed over 117,000 hours of employee safety training, including\nphysical security and cybersecurity training, during 2022. Additionally, through frequent labor-management meetings, the Company encourages open\nexchanges to explore new ways to further enhance safety on the job. All employees are empowered to demonstrate safety leadership by taking the time they\nneed to complete a task safely and to use “Stop Work Authority” — the power to stop working immediately whenever they believe a task is unsafe — to\npersonally mitigate the hazard or issue or collaborate with management to create a safe situation. The Company believes that this Stop Work Authority is so\nimportant that it is stated on the back of every employee’s identification badge.\nFor 2022, the Company had its lowest ORIR injury rate in its recorded history, achieving an 18.8% reduction in injuries compared to 2021, taking into\naccount a 7% decrease in labor hours due to the sales of HOS and the Company’s New York subsidiary. Also, the number of Days Away Restricted or\nTransferred (“DART”) injuries decreased by 36.1% compared to 2021. This decrease shows a significant improvement in those injuries that have a higher\nseverity. For 2022, the Company’s ORIR was 0.85 (52 injuries) and its DART rate was 0.37 (23 injuries), compared to an ORIR of 0.97 (64 injuries) and a\nDART rate of 0.54 (36 injuries) in 2021.\n19\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIn 2022, American Water teams led by promoting safety leading indicator activities, including pre-job safety briefings and near miss reporting, and by\nachieving internal Certified Safe Worker designations. Near miss reports, where employees report potential hazards or incidents in a safe and secure manner,\nincreased by 20% in 2022 over 2021, and 97% of near miss incident corrective actions were completed, with nearly 90% completed within 30 days. The\nCompany utilizes near miss reporting and timely corrective actions as key measurements of employee engagement and safety performance.\nThe commitment to safety as a strategic imperative also includes building a culture of well-being where all employees can feel emotionally safe and live\na healthy lifestyle.

In this regard, the Company continues to focus on the safety of its employees and\ncontractors so that they may return home from work in the same, or better, condition than when they arrived. The Company strives for all employees to feel\nemotionally safe, live a healthy lifestyle and be physically safe at work and at home. The Company assesses occupational health and safety to measure\nperformance across the entire organization, with the ultimate goal of achieving zero incidents, injuries and fatalities for the Company’s employees and\ncontractors.\nTo uphold the Company’s commitment to safety, the Company’s employees completed over 117,000 hours of employee safety training, including\nphysical security and cybersecurity training, during 2022. Additionally, through frequent labor-management meetings, the Company encourages open\nexchanges to explore new ways to further enhance safety on the job. All employees are empowered to demonstrate safety leadership by taking the time they\nneed to complete a task safely and to use “Stop Work Authority” — the power to stop working immediately whenever they believe a task is unsafe — to\npersonally mitigate the hazard or issue or collaborate with management to create a safe situation. The Company believes that this Stop Work Authority is so\nimportant that it is stated on the back of every employee’s identification badge.\nFor 2022, the Company had its lowest ORIR injury rate in its recorded history, achieving an 18.8% reduction in injuries compared to 2021, taking into\naccount a 7% decrease in labor hours due to the sales of HOS and the Company’s New York subsidiary. Also, the number of Days Away Restricted or\nTransferred (“DART”) injuries decreased by 36.1% compared to 2021. This decrease shows a significant improvement in those injuries that have a higher\nseverity. For 2022, the Company’s ORIR was 0.85 (52 injuries) and its DART rate was 0.37 (23 injuries), compared to an ORIR of 0.97 (64 injuries) and a\nDART rate of 0.54 (36 injuries) in 2021.\n19\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIn 2022, American Water teams led by promoting safety leading indicator activities, including pre-job safety briefings and near miss reporting, and by\nachieving internal Certified Safe Worker designations. Near miss reports, where employees report potential hazards or incidents in a safe and secure manner,\nincreased by 20% in 2022 over 2021, and 97% of near miss incident corrective actions were completed, with nearly 90% completed within 30 days. The\nCompany utilizes near miss reporting and timely corrective actions as key measurements of employee engagement and safety performance.\nThe commitment to safety as a strategic imperative also includes building a culture of well-being where all employees can feel emotionally safe and live\na healthy lifestyle.

The Company is committed to diversity among its workforce, executive and senior management leadership teams, by\nreflecting the diversity of the communities in which the Company serves. The Company expects all leaders to lead with inclusion, diversity and equity.\nIn 2022, the Company included in its APP new workforce diversity performance goals designed to increase the representation of women and ethnic and\nracial diversity in the Company’s workplace. The goals measure the percentage of female and racial/ethnic diversity among the Company’s workforce based on\nvoluntary self-identification.

The revolving credit facility currently expires in accordance with its terms in October 2027. Historically, we have regularly used our\ncommercial paper program rather than the revolving credit facility as a principal source of short-term borrowing due to the generally more attractive rates we\ngenerally could obtain in the commercial paper market.

For example, under the terms of the revolving credit facility, our consolidated debt cannot exceed 70% of our consolidated\ncapitalization, as determined under the terms of the facility. If our equity were to decline or debt were to increase to a level that causes us to exceed this limit,\nlenders under the facility would be entitled to refuse any further extension of credit and to declare all of the outstanding debt thereunder immediately due and\npayable.

If we do not have sufficient cash flows to pay the principal and interest on\nour outstanding debt, we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt, reduce capital investments, sell assets, borrow additional funds or sell\nadditional equity. In addition, if our business does not generate sufficient cash flows from operations, or if we are unable to incur indebtedness sufficient to\nenable us to fund our liquidity needs, we may be unable to plan for or respond to changes in our business, which could cause our financial condition, operating\nresults and prospects to be affected materially and adversely.\n36\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOur inability to access the debt or equity capital or financial markets or other events could affect our ability to meet our long-term commitments or liquidity\nneeds at reasonable cost, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to cash from operations, during 2022, we relied primarily on a revolving credit facility, which was increased from $2.25 billion to $2.75\nbillion in October 2022, a commercial paper program, which was increased from $2.10 billion to $2.60 billion in October 2022, and the debt capital markets, to\nsatisfy our liquidity needs. The revolving credit facility currently expires in accordance with its terms in October 2027. Historically, we have regularly used our\ncommercial paper program rather than the revolving credit facility as a principal source of short-term borrowing due to the generally more attractive rates we\ngenerally could obtain in the commercial paper market. As of December 31, 2022, there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility,\n$1,177 million of commercial paper outstanding and $78 million in outstanding letters of credit. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to\naccess this commercial paper program or revolving credit facility, when, as and if desired, or that the amount of capital available thereunder will be sufficient to\nmeet all of our liquidity needs at a reasonable, or any, cost.\nOur ability to comply with covenants in our revolving credit facility and our other consolidated indebtedness is subject to various risks and uncertainties,\nincluding events beyond our control. For example, under the terms of the revolving credit facility, our consolidated debt cannot exceed 70% of our consolidated\ncapitalization, as determined under the terms of the facility. If our equity were to decline or debt were to increase to a level that causes us to exceed this limit,\nlenders under the facility would be entitled to refuse any further extension of credit and to declare all of the outstanding debt thereunder immediately due and\npayable. Events that could cause a reduction in equity include, without limitation, a significant write-down of our goodwill. To avoid such a default, a waiver or\nrenegotiation of this covenant would be required, which ",

At the same time, Cal Am submitted an application (the “Original Jurisdiction Application”) to the Coastal Commission for a coastal\ndevelopment permit for those project components located within the Coastal Commission’s original jurisdiction. After Coastal Commission staff issued reports\nrecommending denial of the Original Jurisdiction Application, noting potential impacts on environmentally sensitive habitat areas and wetlands and possible\ndisproportionate impacts to communities of concern, in September 2020, Cal Am withdrew the Original Jurisdiction Application in order to address the staff’s\nenvironmental justice concerns.

SDWR accepted Monterey County’s filing in December 2019, and now lists Monterey County as the exclusive GSA for the site.\nIn December 2019, the City filed a lawsuit in Monterey County Superior Court challenging Monterey County’s filing, and SDWR’s acceptance of the\nfiling, as the exclusive GSA for the CEMEX site. The City has named Monterey County and its Board of Supervisors, its GSA, and SDWR and its director as\ndefendants, and the SVBGSA and its Board of Directors as real parties. The City seeks to invalidate Monterey County’s filing, as well as injunctive relief to\npreserve the City’s status as a GSA for the site. To protect its interest in the matter, Cal Am filed an application to intervene in this lawsuit, which was granted.\nMonterey County filed cross-claims against the City and SDWR.

Subject to applicable regulations, the Company may elect to\namend or cancel the program or the stock repurchase parameters at its discretion to manage dilution.\nFrom April 1, 2015, the date repurchases under the anti-dilutive stock repurchase program commenced, through December 31, 2022, the Company\nrepurchased an aggregate of 4,860,000 shares of its common stock under the program, leaving an aggregate of 5,140,000 shares available for repurchase under\nthis program.

See Note 9—Shareholders’ Equity—Dividends and Distributions, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary\nof the limitations on parent company and its subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions. Furthermore, parent company’s operating subsidiaries are\nseparate and distinct legal entities and, other than AWCC, have no obligation to make any payments on the senior notes or to make available or provide any\nfunds for such payment, other than through their repayment obligations under intercompany loans, if any, with AWCC.

Significant judgment is required to determine whether the\nrecognition threshold has been met and, if so, the appropriate amount of unrecognized tax benefit to be recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Company evaluates the probability of realizing deferred tax assets quarterly by reviewing a forecast of future taxable income and its intent and\nability to implement tax planning strategies, if necessary, to realize deferred tax assets. The Company also assesses its ability to utilize tax attributes, including\nthose in the form of carryforwards, for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements. The Company records valuation allowances\nfor deferred tax assets when it concludes that it is more-likely-than-not such benefit will not be realized in future periods.\nUnder GAAP, specifically ASC 740, Income Taxes, the tax effects of changes in tax laws must be recognized in the period in which the law is enacted.\nASC 740 also requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be measured at the enacted tax rate expected to apply when temporary differences are to be realized\nor settled.

As disclosed by management, for each regulatory jurisdiction where the Company conducts\nbusiness, the Company assesses, at the end of each reporting period, whether the regulatory assets continue to meet the criteria for probable future recovery and\nregulatory liabilities continue to meet the criteria for probable future settlement. This assessment includes consideration of factors such as changes in regulatory\nenvironments, recent rate orders (including recent rate orders on recovery of a specific or similar incurred cost to other regulated entities in the same\njurisdiction) and the status of any pending or potential legislation.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to accounting for the effects of rate regulation is a critical audit\nmatter are the significant judgment by management in accounting for regulatory assets and liabilities relative to whether regulatory assets continue to meet the\ncriteria for probable future recovery and regulatory liabilities continue to meet the criteria for probable future settlement as a result of changes in regulatory\nenvironments, recent rate orders, and the status of any pending or potential legislation. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and\neffort in performing audit procedures and evaluating audit evidence obtained relating to management’s judgments.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated\nfinancial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Company’s regulatory accounting process, including\ncontrols over management’s assessment and consideration of factors related to the probability of future recovery or settlement. These procedures also included,\namong others, evaluating the reasonableness of management’s judgments regarding the probability of recovery and settlement based on the Company’s\ncorrespondence with regulators, status of regulatory proceedings, past practices, and other relevant information; evaluating the related accounting and\ndisclosure implications; and evaluating regulatory assets and liabilities balances based on provisions and formulas outlined in rate orders and other\ncorrespon",

Letters of credit are non-debt instruments maintained to provide credit support for certain transactions as requested by third parties.\nSubject to satisfying certain conditions, the credit agreement also permits AWCC to increase the maximum commitment under the facility by up to an\naggregate of $500 million and to request extensions of its expiration date for up to two one-year periods. As of December 31, 2022, AWCC had no outstanding\nborrowings and $78 million of outstanding letters of credit under the revolving credit facility, with $1.50 billion available to fulfill the Company’s short-term\nliquidity needs and to issue letters of credit. The Company regularly evaluates the capital markets and closely monitors the financial condition of the financial\ninstitutions with contractual commitments in its revolving credit facility. Interest rates on advances under the facility are based on a credit spread to the Secured\nOvernight Financing Rate (or applicable market replacement rate) or base rate, each determined in accordance with Moody Investors Service’s and S&P Global\nRatings’ then applicable credit rating on AWCC’s senior unsecured, non-credit enhanced debt.\nOn October 26, 2022, AWCC and certain lenders amended and restated the credit agreement with respect to the revolving credit facility to, among other\nthings, increase the maximum commitments under the facility from $2.25 billion to $2.75 billion and to extend the expiration date of the facility from March\n2025 to October 2027. Also, effective October  26, 2022, the maximum aggregate principal amount of short-term borrowings authorized under AWCC’s\ncommercial paper program was increased from $2.10 billion to $2.60 billion.\nOn March 20, 2020, AWCC entered into a Term Loan Credit Agreement, by and among parent company, AWCC and the lenders party thereto (the “Term\nLoan Facility”).

Pension plan assets are invested in a number of actively managed, commingled funds, and limited partnerships including\nequities, fixed income securities, guaranteed annuity contracts with insurance companies, real estate funds and real estate investment trusts (“REITs”).\nIn December 2022, the Company amended the American Water Pension Plan (“AWPP”), a tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan, to restructure it as\nof December 31, 2022. The restructuring involved the spin-off of certain inactive participants from the existing AWPP into a separate tax-qualified defined\nbenefit pension plan, AWPP Inactive. Benefits offered to the plan participants remain unchanged. Actuarial gains and losses associated with AWPP Inactive\nwill be amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants, which increases the amortization period from approximately 7 years\nto 18 years.

The Retiree Welfare Plan is funded by the Bargained VEBA trust, the Non-Bargained Retiree Voluntary Employees’ Beneficiary Association\n(“Non-Bargained VEBA”) trust, and the American Water Life Insurance Voluntary Employees’ Beneficiary Association (“Life VEBA”) Trust.\n115\n\n\nTable of Contents\nPresented in the tables below are the fair values and asset allocations of the postretirement benefit plan assets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively, by asset category:\nAsset Category\n2023 Target\nAllocation\nTotal\nQuoted Prices in\nActive Markets for\nIdentical Assets\n(Level 1)\nSignificant\nObservable Inputs\n(Level 2)\nSignificant\nUnobservable Inputs\n(Level 3)\nPercentage of Plan\nAssets as of December\n31, 2022\nBargained VEBA:\n \n \n \n \n \n \nCash\n$\n3 \n$\n3 \n$\n— \n$\n— \n2 %\nEquity securities:\n— %  \n \n \n \n \nU.S. large cap\n— \n— \n— \n— \n— %\nInternational\n— \n— \n— \n— \n— %\nFixed income securities:\n100 %  \n \n \n \nU.S. Treasury securities and\ngovernment bonds\n131 \n72 \n59 \n— \n97 %\nLong duration bond fund\n1 \n1 \n— \n— \n1 %\nTotal bargained VEBA\n100 % $\n135 \n$\n76 \n$\n59 \n$\n— \n100 %\nNon-bargained VEBA:\n \n \n \n \n \n \nCash\n$\n1 \n$\n1 \n$\n— \n$\n— \n1 %\nEquity securities:\n60 %  \n \n \n \n \nU.S. large cap\n40 \n40 \n— \n— \n34 %\nInternational\n29 \n29 \n— \n— \n25 %\nFixed income securities:\n40 %  \n \n \n \nCore fixed income bond fund (a)\n47 \n— \n47 \n— \n40 %\nTotal non-bargained VEBA\n100 % $\n117 \n$\n70 \n$\n47 \n$\n— \n100 %\nLife VEBA:\n \n \n \n \n \n \nCash\n$\n2 \n$\n2 \n$\n— \n$\n— \n100 %\nEquity securities:\n— %  \n \n \n \n \nU.S. large cap\n— \n— \n— \n— \n— %\nFixed income securities:\n100 %  \n \n \n \nCore fixed income bond fund (a)\n— \n— \n— \n— \n— %\nTotal life VEBA\n100 % $\n2 \n$\n2 \n$\n— \n$\n— \n100 %\nTotal\n100 % $\n254 \n$\n148 \n$\n106 \n$\n— \n100 %\n(a)\nIncludes cash for margin requirements.\n116\n\n\nTable of Contents\nAsset Category\n2022 Target\nAllocation\nTotal\nQuoted Prices in\nActive Markets for\nIdentical Assets\n(Level 1)\nSignificant\nObservable Inputs\n(Level 2)\nSignificant\nUnobservable Inputs\n(Level 3)\nPercentage of Plan\nAssets as of 12/31/2021\nBargained VEBA:\n \n \n \n \n \n \nCash\n$\n10 \n$\n10 \n$\n— \n$\n— \n3 %\nEquity securities:\n4 %  \n \n \n \n \nU.S. large cap\n18 \n18 \n— \n— \n5 %\nInternational\n1 \n1 \n— \n— \n— %\nFixed income securities:\n96 %  \n \n \n \nU.S. Treasury securities and\ngovernment bonds\n363 \n279 \n84 \n— \n91 %\nLong duration bond",

The issuance of preferred stock, while providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes,\ncould have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control, causing the market price of a share of Common Stock to decline, or impairing the\nvoting and other rights of the holders of Common Stock.\n1\n\n\nCertain Anti-Takeover Provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, and the DGCL\nThe following provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws could deter, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring t",

      "output": "Based on the collected outputs, we have gathered the following information:\n\n1. **Current Assets**: The value of current assets is reported as \\$1,255 million as of December 31, 2022. This is supported by a citation mentioning commercial paper and letters of credit.\n\n2. **Current Liabilities**: The value of current liabilities is reported as \\$2,811 million as of December 31, 2022. This is supported by a citation from the \"Consolidated Balance Sheets\" section.\n\nTo determine if American Water Works has positive working capital, we need to calculate the difference between current assets and current liabilities:\n\n- **Working Capital** = Current Assets - Current Liabilities\n- **Working Capital** = \\$1,255 million - \\$2,811 million = -\\$1,556 million\n\nThis calculation shows that American Water Works has negative working capital as of December 31, 2022.\n\nThe information gathered is sufficient to answer the question. There are no conflicting answers regarding the values of current assets and current liabilities, as both are supported by citations from the financial document. Therefore, we can conclude that American Water Works does not have positive working capital based on FY2022 data."
