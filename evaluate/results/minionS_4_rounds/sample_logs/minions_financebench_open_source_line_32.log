--- Question ---
Does AMD have a reasonably healthy liquidity profile based on its quick ratio for FY22? If the quick ratio is not relevant to measure liquidity, please state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
AMD has a reasonably healthy liquidity profile for FY22 with a quick ratio of approximately 1.29.

--- Ground Truth ---
['Yes. The quick ratio is 1.57, calculated as (cash and cash equivalents+Short term investments+Accounts receivable, net+receivables from related parties)/ (current liabilities).']

--- Correctness Evaluation ---
Is correct: False
Confidence: 0.80
Reasoning: The predicted answer states a quick ratio of approximately 1.29, which is outside the 10% tolerance range of the ground truth quick ratio of 1.57 (acceptable range: 1.413 to 1.727). Additionally, the stance on the liquidity profile being 'reasonably healthy' is not supported by the correct quick ratio value.
