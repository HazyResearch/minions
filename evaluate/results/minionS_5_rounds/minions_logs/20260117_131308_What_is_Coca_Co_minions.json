Calculate what was asked by utilizing the line items clearly shown in the income statement.\n\n---\n\nPlease provide succinct advice on the critical information we need to extract from the Financial document. Total length: 695530 characters to answer this question. \n\nAlso consider the following constraints:\n- In your response do NOT use numbered lists.\n- Do NOT structure your response as a sequence of steps.\n",
      "output": "To determine Coca Cola's FY2021 COGS % margin from the financial document, focus on extracting specific line items from the income statement. Identify the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS) and the \"Total Revenue\" or \"Net Sales\" for the fiscal year 2021. The COGS % margin is calculated by dividing the COGS by the Total Revenue and then multiplying the result by 100 to express it as a percentage. Ensure that the figures you use are for the full fiscal year 2021 and are clearly labeled in the document. This will provide the necessary information to calculate the COGS % margin accurately."

Instead, you can assign small, isolated tasks to a less capable worker model that sees only a single chunk of text at a time. Any cross-chunk or multi-document reasoning must be handled by you.\n\n## Your Job: Write Two Python Functions\n\n### FUNCTION #1: `prepare_jobs(context, prev_job_manifests, prev_job_outputs) -> List[JobManifest]`\n- Break the document(s) into chunks (using the provided chunking function, if needed). Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 12 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`. All **multi-chunk integration** or **global reasoning** is your responsibility here.\n- Return one **aggregated string** suitable for further supervisor inspection.\n\n\n\n## Relevant Pydantic Models\n\nThe following models are already in the global scope. **Do NOT redefine or re-import them.**\n\n### JobManifest Model\n```\nclass JobManifest(BaseModel):\n    chunk: str  # the actual text for the chunk of the document\n    task: str  # the actual task instruction for the small model\n    advice: str  # optional, any additional advice on how to perform the task\n\n    chunk_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    task_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    job_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n\n```\n\n### JobOutput Model\n```\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    citation: Optional[str]\n    answer: Optional[str]\n\n```\n\n## Function Signatures\n```\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        context (List[str]): A list of documents.

If we do not continuously strengthen our capabilities in marketing and innovation to maintain consumer interest, brand loyalty and market share while we\nselectively expand into other profitable categories in the commercial beverage industry, our business could be negatively affected.\nIf we are not successful in our innovation activities, our financial results may be negatively affected.\nAchieving our business growth objectives depends in part on our ability to evolve and improve our existing beverage products through innovation and to successfully develop,\nintroduce and market new beverage products.

We and our bottling partners may face similar disruptions in the future, which may increase supply chain and packaging\ncosts, or may result in an inability to secure key ingredients and inputs, which could cause delays in delivering our products to our customers and consumers. Although we are\nunable to predict the impact on our ability to source materials in the future, we expect supply chain pressures to continue into 2022.\nIn addition to the above risks, the COVID-19 pandemic may exacerbate other risks related to our business, including risks related to changes in the retail landscape or the loss\nof key retail or foodservice customers; fluctuations in input costs, inflation rates, and foreign currency exchange rates; and the ability of third-party service providers and\nbusiness partners to fulfill their\n11\n\n\nrespective commitments and responsibilities to us in a timely manner and in accordance with the agreed-upon terms. The continuing evolution of the pandemic may also\npresent risks not currently known to us.\nIncreased competition could hurt our business.\nWe operate in the highly competitive commercial beverage industry. For additional information regarding the competitive environment in which we operate, including the\nnames of certain of our significant competitors, refer to the heading “Competition” set forth in Part I, “Item 1. Business” of this report. Our ability to maintain or gain share of\nsales in the global market or in local markets may be limited as a result of actions by competitors. Competitive pressures may cause the Company and our bottling partners to\nreduce prices we charge customers or may restrict our and our bottlers’ ability to increase prices, as may be necessary in response to commodity and other cost increases. Such\npressures may also increase marketing costs along with in-store placement and slotting fees. In addition, the rapid growth of e‑commerce may create additional consumer price\ndeflation by, among other things, facilitating comparison shopping, and could potentially threaten the value of some of our legacy route-to-market strategies and thus negatively\naffect revenues. If we do not continuously strengthen our capabilities in marketing and innovation to maintain consumer interest, brand loyalty and market share while we\nselectively expand into other profitable categories in the commercial beverage industry, our business could be negatively affected.\nIf we are not successful in our innovation activities, our financial results may be negatively affected.\nAchieving our business growth objectives depends in part on our ability to evolve and improve our existing beverage products through innovation and to successfully develop,\nintroduce and market new beverage products.

Consistent with the Closing Agreement, the IRS did not assert penalties, and it has yet to     do so.\nThe IRS designated the Company’s matter for litigation on October 15, 2015. Litigation designation is an IRS determination that forecloses to a company any and all alternative\nmeans for resolution of a tax dispute. As a result of the IRS’ designation of the Company’s matter for litigation, the Company was forced to either accept the IRS’ newly\nimposed tax assessment and pay the full amount of the asserted tax or litigate the matter in the federal courts. The matter remains subject to the IRS’ litigation designation,\npreventing the Company from any attempt to settle or otherwise mutually resolve the matter with the IRS.\nThe Company consequently initiated litigation by filing a petition in the Tax Court in December 2015, challenging the tax adjustments enumerated in the Notice.\nPrior to trial, the IRS increased its transfer pricing adjustment by $385 million, resulting in an additional tax adjustment of $135 million. The Company obtained a summary\njudgment in its favor on a different matter related to Mexican foreign tax credits, which thereafter effectively reduced the IRS’ potential tax adjustment by approximately $138\nmillion.\nThe trial was held in the Tax Court from March through May 2018, and final post-trial briefs were filed and exchanged in April 2019.\nOn November 18, 2020, the Tax Court issued the Opinion in which it predominantly sided with the IRS but agreed with the Company that dividends previously paid by the\nforeign licensees to the U.S. parent company in reliance upon the Closing Agreement should continue to be allowed to offset royalties, including those that would become\npayable to the Company in accordance with the Opinion. The Tax Court reserved ruling on the effect of Brazilian legal restrictions on the payment of royalties by the\nCompany’s licensee in Brazil until after the Tax Court issues its opinion in the separate case of 3M Co. & Subs. v. Commissioner, T.C. Docket No. 5816-13 (filed March 11,\n2013). Once the Tax Court issues its opinion in 3M Co. & Subs. v. Commissioner, the Company expects the Tax Court thereafter to render another opinion, and ultimately a\nfinal decision, in the Company’s case.\nThe Company believes that the IRS and the Tax Court misinterpreted and misapplied the applicable regulations in reallocating income earned by the Company’s foreign\nlicensees to increase the Company’s U.S. tax. Moreover, the Company believes that the retroactive imposition of such tax liability using a calculation methodology different\nfrom that previously agreed upon by the IRS and the Company, and audited by the IRS for over a decade, is unconstitutional.

As a result of the IRS’ designation of the Company’s matter for litigation, the Company was forced to either accept the IRS’ newly\nimposed tax assessment and pay the full amount of the asserted tax or litigate the matter in the federal courts. The matter remains subject to the IRS’ litigation designation,\npreventing the Company from any attempt to settle or otherwise mutually resolve the matter with the IRS.\nThe Company consequently initiated litigation by filing a petition in the Tax Court in December 2015, challenging the tax adjustments enumerated in the Notice.\nPrior to trial, the IRS increased its transfer pricing adjustment by $385 million, resulting in an additional tax adjustment of $135 million. The Company obtained a summary\njudgment in its favor on a different matter related to Mexican foreign tax credits, which thereafter effectively reduced the IRS’ potential tax adjustment by approximately $138\nmillion.\nThe trial was held in the Tax Court from March through May 2018, and final post-trial briefs were filed and exchanged in April 2019.\nOn November 18, 2020, the Tax Court issued the Opinion in which it predominantly sided with the IRS but agreed with the Company that dividends previously paid by the\nforeign licensees to the U.S. parent company in reliance upon the Closing Agreement should continue to be allowed to offset royalties, including those that would become\npayable to the Company in accordance with the Opinion. The Tax Court reserved ruling on the effect of Brazilian legal restrictions on the payment of royalties by the\nCompany’s licensee in Brazil until after the Tax Court issues its opinion in the separate case of 3M Co. & Subs. v. Commissioner, T.C. Docket No. 5816-13 (filed March 11,\n2013). Once the Tax Court issues its opinion in 3M Co. & Subs. v. Commissioner, the Company expects the Tax Court thereafter to render another opinion, and ultimately a\nfinal decision, in the Company’s case.\nThe Company believes that the IRS and the Tax Court misinterpreted and misapplied the applicable regulations in reallocating income earned by the Company’s foreign\nlicensees to increase the Company’s U.S. tax. Moreover, the Company believes that the retroactive imposition of such tax liability using a calculation methodology different\nfrom that previously agreed upon by the IRS and the Company, and audited by the IRS for over a decade, is unconstitutional. The Company intends to assert its claims on\nappeal and vigorously defend its position.\nIn determining the amount of tax reserve to be recorded as of December 31, ",

We have developed systemwide knowledge-sharing routines and\nprocesses, which include the management of any supply chain challenges. As of the date of this filing, while we have experienced some temporary supply chain disruptions,\nthere has been no material impact, and we do not foresee a material impact, on our and our bottling partners’ ability to manufacture or distribute our products.\n33\n\n\nDespite the pandemic, we are not losing sight of long-term opportunities for our business. The pandemic helped us realize we could be much bolder in our efforts to change. We\nidentified the following key objectives to navigate the pandemic and position us to capture growth: winning more consumers; gaining market share; maintaining strong system\neconomics; strengthening stakeholder impact; and equipping the organization to win. In order to deliver against these objectives, we focused on the following priorities:\nunlocking the potential of our portfolio of strong global, regional and scaled local brands; developing a robust innovation pipeline focusing on scalable initiatives; increasing\nconsumer-centric marketing effectiveness and efficiency; winning in the marketplace with aligned data-driven revenue growth management and execution capabilities; and\nfurther embedding ESG goals into our operations. In August 2020, the Company announced strategic steps to transform our organizational structure to better enable us to\ncapture growth in the fast-changing marketplace. The Company has transformed into a networked global organization designed to combine the power of scale with the deep\nknowledge required to win locally. Refer to Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our strategic realignment initiatives.\nChallenges and Risks\nBeing global provides unique opportunities for our Company. Challenges and risks accompany those opportunities. Our management has identified certain challenges and risks\nthat demand the attention of our Company and the commercial beverage industry.

We also review current levels of interest rates and inflation to assess the reasonableness of our expected long-term rates of return on plan assets. Our investment\nobjective for our pension assets is to ensure all funded pension plans have sufficient assets to meet their benefit obligations when they become due. As a result, the Company\nperiodically revises asset allocations, where appropriate, to seek to improve returns and manage risk.\nIn 2021, the Company’s total income related to defined benefit pension plans was $61 million, which included net periodic pension income of $180 million and net charges of\n$119 million related to settlements, curtailments and special termination benefits. In 2022, we expect our net periodic pension income to be approximately $188 million. The\nincrease in 2022 expected net periodic pension income is primarily due to an increase in the weighted-average discount rate at December 31, 2021 compared to December 31,\n2020, favorable asset performance in 2021 and a reduction in the number of plan participants arising from our strategic realignment initiatives, partially offset by a decrease in\nthe expected weighted-average long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption.

Typically, the Company has not reported unit case volume or recognized concentrate sales volume\nrelated to acquired brands in periods prior to the closing of a transaction. Therefore, the unit case volume and concentrate sales volume related to an acquired brand are\nincremental to prior year volume. We generally do not consider the acquisition of a brand to be a structural change.\n“Licensed brands” refers to brands not owned by the Company but for which we hold certain rights, generally including, but not limited to, distribution rights, and from which\nwe derive an economic benefit when the products are sold. Typically, the Company has not reported unit case volume or recognized concentrate sales volume related to a\nlicensed brand in periods prior to the beginning of the term of a license agreement. Therefore, in the year that a license agreement is entered into, the unit case volume and\nconcentrate sales volume related to a licensed brand are incremental to prior year volume.

If our credit ratings were to be downgraded as a result of changes in\nour capital structure, our major bottlers’ financial performance, changes in the credit rating agencies’ methodology in assessing our credit strength, or for any other reason, our\ncost of borrowing could increase. Additionally, if certain bottlers’ credit ratings were to decline, the Company’s equity income could be reduced as a result of the potential\nincrease in interest expense for those bottlers.\nWe monitor our financial ratios and, as indicated above, the rating agencies consider these ratios in assessing our credit ratings. Each rating agency employs a different\naggregation methodology and has different thresholds for the various financial ratios. These thresholds are not necessarily permanent, nor are they always fully disclosed to our\nCompany.\nOur global presence and strong capital position give us access to key financial marke",

We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. As a matter of policy, all of our derivative positions are used to reduce risk by\nhedging an underlying economic exposure. Because of the high correlation between the hedging instruments and the underlying exposures, fluctuations in the values of the\ninstruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the values of the underlying exposures.\nWe monitor our exposure to market risks using several objective measurement systems, including a sensitivity analysis to measure our exposure to fluctuations in foreign\ncurrency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Refer to Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our hedging\ntransactions and derivative financial instruments.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rates\nWe manage most of our foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis, which allows us to net certain exposures and take advantage of any natural offsets. In 2021, we\nused 70 functional currencies in addition to the U.S. dollar and generated $25.6 billion of our net operating revenues from operations outside the United States; therefore,\nweakness in some currencies may be offset by strength in other currencies over time. We use derivative financial instruments to further reduce our net exposure to foreign\ncurrency fluctuations.\nOur Company enters into forward exchange contracts and purchases foreign currency options and collars (principally euro, British pound sterling and Japanese yen) to hedge\ncertain portions of forecasted cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. Additionally, we enter into forward exchange contracts to offset the earnings impact related to\nforeign currency fluctuations on certain monetary assets and liabilities. We also enter into forward exchange contracts as hedges of net investments in foreign operations.\nThe total notional values of our foreign currency derivatives were $13,691 million and $16,663 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These values included\nderivative instruments that are designated and qualify for hedge accounting as well as economic hedges. The fair value of foreign currency derivatives that qualify for hedge\naccounting resulted in a net unrealized gain of $174 million as of December 31, 2021, and we estimate that a 10 percent weakening of the U.S. dollar would have decreased the\nnet unrealized gain to $172 million.

The\npreparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses\nand the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Although these estimates are based on our knowledge of\ncurrent events and actions we may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions.

Additionally, there are situations in which consolidation is required even\nthough the usual condition of consolidation (ownership of a majority voting interest) does not apply. Generally, this occurs when an entity holds an interest in another business\nenterprise that was achieved through arrangements that do not involve voting interests, which results in a disproportionate relationship between such entity’s voting interests in,\nand its exposure to the economic risks and potential rewards of, the other business enterprise. This disproportionate relationship results in what is known as a variable interest,\nand the entity in which we have the variable interest is referred to as a “VIE.” An enterprise must consolidate a VIE if it is determined to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE.\nThe primary beneficiary has both (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and (2) the obligation to\nabsorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.\nOur Company holds interests in certain VIEs, primarily bottling operations, for which we were not determined to be the primary beneficiary. Our variable interests in these\nVIEs primarily relate to equity investments, profit guarantees or subordinated financial support. Refer to Note 11. Although these financial arrangements resulted in our holding\nvariable interests in these entities, they did not empower us to direct the activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact the VIEs’ economic performance. Our Company’s\ninvestments, plus any loans and guarantees, and other subordinated financial support related to these VIEs totaled $1,980 million and $2,567 million as of December 31, 2021\nand 2020, respectively, representing our maximum exposures to loss.

Operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets represent our right to use an\nunderlying asset for the lease term and are included in the line item other noncurrent assets on our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease liabilities represent our\nobligation to make lease payments arising from the lease and are included in the line items accounts payable and accrued expenses and other noncurrent liabilities on our\nconsolidated balance sheet. Operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the\nlease term at the commencement date",

Additionally, CCBA’s property, plant and equipment was not depreciated and its definite-lived intangible assets\nwere not amortized during this period. While the Company had discussions with a number of potential partners throughout the period CCBA was held for sale, during the\nsecond quarter of 2019 the Company updated its plans with the intent to maintain its controlling stake in CCBA, which resulted in CCBA no longer qualifying as held for sale\nor as a discontinued operation. As a result of this change, we recorded a $160 million adjustment to reduce the carrying value of CCBA’s property, plant and equipment and\ndefinite-lived intangible assets by an additional $34 million and $126 million, respectively, to reflect additional depreciation and amortization that would have been recognized\nduring the period CCBA was held for sale. This adjustment was recorded in the line item other income (loss) — net in our consolidated statement of income.\nAssets and Liabilities Held for Sale\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company had certain bottling operations in Asia Pacific that met the criteria to be classified as held for sale. As a result, we were required to\nrecord their assets and liabilities at the lower of carrying value or fair value less any costs to sell. As the fair value less any costs to sell exceeded the carrying value, the related\nassets and liabilities were recorded at their carrying value. These assets and liabilities were included in the Bottling Investments operating segment. The Company expects these\nbottling operations to be refranchised during 2022.\n73\n\n\nThe following table presents information related to the major classes of assets and liabilities that were classified as held for sale\nand were included in the line items prepaid expenses and other current assets and accounts payable and accrued expenses, respectively, in our consolidated balance sheet (in\nmillions):\nDecember 31, 2021\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments\n$\n228 \nTrade accounts receivable, less allowances\n21 \nInventories\n55 \nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\n36 \nOther noncurrent assets\n9 \nDefe",

The purpose of these adjustments is to ensure a consistent year-to-year comparison of the specific performance\ncriteria. Performance share unit awards granted to executives include a relative TSR modifier to determine the final number of performance share units earned. The fair value of\nperformance share units that include a TSR modifier is determined using a Monte Carlo valuation model. For these awards, the number of performance share units earned based\non the certified achievement of the predefined performance criteria will be reduced or increased if the Company’s total shareowner return over the performance period relative\nto a predefined compensation comparator group of companies fell outside of a predefined range. The fair value of performance share units that do not include a TSR modifier is\nthe closing market price per share of the Company’s stock on the grant date less the present value of the expected dividends not received during the performance period. The\nperformance share unit awards will generally vest at the end of the respective performance period.\nDuring 2021, in addition to granting performance share unit awards with a three-year performance period, the Company granted emerging stronger performance share unit\nawards with a predefined performance period of two years. The award’s performance criterion is earnings per share, and the award includes a relative TSR modifier.

As of December 31, 2021, the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $906 million. As described in Note 11, on September 17, 2015 the\nCompany received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency from the Internal Revenue Service for the tax years 2007 through 2009 in the amount of $3.3 billion for the period. On\nNovember 18, 2020, the U.S. Tax Court issued an opinion predominantly siding with the IRS related to the Company’s transfer pricing between its U.S. parent company\nand certain of its foreign affiliates for tax years 2007 through 2009.\nWhile the Company continues to disagree with the IRS positions and the portions of the opinion affirming such positions, it is possible that some portion or all of the\nadjustment proposed by the IRS could ultimately be upheld. As a result of the application of ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes, the Company has recorded a tax\nreserve of $400 million for this matter as of December 31, 2021.\nAuditing management’s evaluation of uncertain tax positions, including the uncertain tax position associated with the IRS notice and opinion, was especially challenging\ndue to the level of subjectivity and significant judgment associated with the recognition and measurement of the tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained.\n126\n\n\nHow We Addressed the\nMatter in Our Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the effectiveness of controls over the Company’s accounting process for uncertain tax positions. Our\nprocedures included testing controls addressing the completeness of uncertain tax positions, controls relating to the identification and recognition of the uncertain tax\npositions, controls over the measurement of the unrecognized tax benefit, and controls over the identification of developments related to existing uncertain tax positions.\nOur audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the assumptions the Company used to assess its uncertain tax positions and related unrecognized tax benefit\namounts by jurisdiction.

The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the\ncritical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nAccounting for uncertain tax positions\nDescription of the\nMatter\nAs described in Note 11 and Note 14 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements, the Company is involved in various income tax matters for which the ultimate\noutcomes are uncertain. As of December 31, 2021, the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $906 million. As described in Note 11, on September 17, 2015 the\nCompany received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency from the Internal Revenue Service for the tax years 2007 through 2009 in the amount of $3.3 billion for the period. On\nNovember 18, 2020, the U.S. Tax Court issued an opinion predominantly siding with the IRS related to the Company’s transfer pricing between its U.S. parent company\nand certain of its foreign affiliates for tax years 2007 through 2009.\nWhile the Company continues to disagree with the IRS positions and the portions of the opinion affirming such positions, it is possible that some portion or all of the\nadjustment proposed by the IRS could ultimately be upheld. As a result of the application of ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes, the Company has recorded a tax\nreserve of $400 million for this matter as of December 31, 2021.\nAuditing management’s evaluation of uncertain tax positions, including the uncertain tax position associated with the IRS notice and opinion, was especially challenging\ndue to the level of subjectivity and significant judgment associated with the recognition and measurement of the tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained.\n126\n\n\nHow We Addressed the\nMatter in Our Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the effectiveness of controls over the Company’s accounting process for uncertain tax positions. Our\nprocedures included testing controls addressing the completeness of uncertain tax positions, controls relating to the identification and recognition of the uncertain tax\npositions, controls over the measurement of the unrecognized tax benefit, and controls over the identification of developments related to existing uncertain tax positions.\nOur audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the assumptions the Company used to assess its uncertain tax positions and related unrecognized tax benefit\namounts by jurisdiction.

We also assessed the Company’s disclosure of uncertain tax positions included in Note 11 and Note 14.\nValuation of trademarks with indefinite lives and goodwill\nDescription of the\nMatter\nAs described in Note 1 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements, the Company performs an annual impairment test of its indefinite-lived intangible assets,\nincluding trademarks with indefinite lives and goodwill, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired. Each impairment test may be\nqualitative or quantitative. Trademarks with indefinite lives and goodwill were $14.5 billion and $19.4 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2021.\nAuditing the valuation of trademarks with indefinite lives and reporting units with goodwill involved complex judgment due to the significant estimation required in\ndetermining the fair value of the trademarks with indefinite lives and related reporting units with goodwill, respectively. Specifically, the fair value estimates were\nsensitive to significant assumptions about future market and economic conditions. Significant assumptions used in the Company’s fair value estimates included sales\nvolume, pricing, royalty rates, long-term growth rates, and cost of capital, as applicable.\nHow We Addressed the\nMatter in Our Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s annual impairment tests for trademarks with\nindefinite lives and reporting units with goodwill. For example, we tested management’s risk assessment process to determine whether to perform a quantitative or\nqualitative test and management’s review controls over the valuation models and underlying assumptions used to develop such estimates. For impairment tests of reporting\nunits with goodwill, we also tested controls over the determination of the carrying value of the reporting units. We tested the estimated fair values of the trademarks with\nindefinite lives and reporting units with goodwill based on our risk assessments.\nOur audit procedures included, among others, comparing significant judgmental inputs to observable third party and industry sources, considering other observable market\ntransactions, and evaluating the reasonableness of management’s projected financial information by comparing to third party industry projections, third party economic\ngrowth projections, and other internal and external dat",

Our bottling partners either combine concentrates with still or sparkling water and sweeteners (depending on the\nproduct), or combine syrups with still or sparkling water, to produce finished beverages. The finished beverages are packaged in authorized containers, such as cans and\nrefillable and nonrefillable glass and plastic bottles, bearing our trademarks or trademarks licensed to us and are then sold to retailers directly or, in some cases, through\nwholesalers or other bottlers. In addition, outside the United States, our bottling partners are typically authorized to manufacture fountain syrups, using our concentrates, which\nthey sell to fountain retailers for use in producing beverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers who in turn sell and distribute the fountain\nsyrups to fountain retailers. Our concentrate operations are included in our geographic operating segments and our Global Ventures operating segment.\nOur finished product operations generate net operating revenues by selling sparkling soft drinks and a variety of other finished beverages to retailers or to distributors and\nwholesalers who in turn sell the beverages to retailers. These operations consist primarily of our consolidated bottling and distribution operations, which are included in our\nBottling Investments operating segment. In certain markets, the Company also operates non-bottling finished product operations in which we sell finished beverages to\ndistributors and wholesalers that are generally not one of the Company’s bottling partners. These operations are generally included in one of our geographic operating segments\nor our Global Ventures operating segment. Additionally, we sell directly to consumers through retail stores operated by Costa Limited (“Costa”). These sales are included in our\nGlobal Ventures operating segment. In the United States, we manufacture fountain syrups and sell them to fountain retailers, who use the fountain syrups to produce beverages\nfor immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners who in turn sell the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. These fountain syrup sales are\nincluded in our North America operating segment.\nFor information regarding net operating revenues and unit case volume related to our concentrate operations and finished product operations, refer to the heading “Our\nBusiness — General” set forth in Part II,",

Our bottling partners either combine concentrates with still or sparkling water and sweeteners (depending on the\nproduct), or combine syrups with still or sparkling water, to produce finished beverages. The finished beverages are packaged in authorized containers, such as cans and\nrefillable and nonrefillable glass and plastic bottles, bearing our trademarks or trademarks licensed to us and are then sold to retailers directly or, in some cases, through\nwholesalers or other bottlers. In addition, outside the United States, our bottling partners are typically authorized to manufacture fountain syrups, using our concentrates, which\nthey sell to fountain retailers for use in producing beverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers who in turn sell and distribute the fountain\nsyrups to fountain retailers. Our concentrate operations are included in our geographic operating segments and our Global Ventures operating segment.\nOur finished product operations generate net operating revenues by selling sparkling soft drinks and a variety of other finished beverages to retailers or to distributors and\nwholesalers who in turn sell the beverages to retailers. These operations consist primarily of our consolidated bottling and distribution operations, which are included in our\nBottling Investments operating segment. In certain markets, the Company also operates non-bottling finished product operations in which we sell finished beverages to\ndistributors and wholesalers that are generally not one of the Company’s bottling partners. These operations are generally included in one of our geographic operating segments\nor our Global Ventures operating segment. Additionally, we sell directly to consumers through retail stores operated by Costa Limited (“Costa”). These sales are included in our\nGlobal Ventures operating segment. In the United States, we manufacture fountain syrups and sell them to fountain retailers, who use the fountain syrups to produce beverages\nfor immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners who in turn sell the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. These fountain syrup sales are\nincluded in our North America operating segment.\nFor information regarding net operating revenues and unit case volume related to our concentrate operations and finished product operations, refer to the heading “Our\nBusiness — General” set forth in Part II,",

This baseline price may be adjusted periodically by the Company, up to a maximum\nindexed ceiling price, and is adjusted quarterly based upon changes in certain sugar or sweetener prices, as applicable. The U.S. unit case volume prepared, packaged, sold and\ndistributed under these legacy bottler’s agreements is not material.\nUnder the terms of the bottler’s agreements, bottlers in the United States generally are not authorized to manufacture fountain syrups. Rather, the Company manufactures and\nsells fountain syrups to authorized fountain wholesalers (including certain authorized bottlers) and some fountain retailers. These wholesalers in turn sell the syrups, or deliver\nthem on our behalf, to restaurants and other retailers.\nPromotional and Marketing Programs\nIn addition to conducting our own independent advertising and marketing activities, we may provide promotional and marketing support and/or funds to our bottlers. In most\ncases, we do this on a discretionary basis under the terms of commitment letters or agreements, even though we are not obligated to do so under the terms of the bottler’s\nagreements between our Company and the bottlers. Also, on a discretionary basis in most cases, our Company may develop and introduce new products, packages and\nequipment to assist the bottlers. Likewise, in many instances, we provide promotional and marketing support and/or funds and/or dispensing equipment and repair services to\nfountain and bottle/can retailers, typically pursuant to marketing agreements. The aggregate amount provided by our Company to bottlers, resellers and other customers of our\nCompany’s products, principally for participation in promotional and marketing programs, was $4.7 billion in 2021.\n6\n\n\nInvestments in Bottling Operations\nMost of our branded beverage products are prepared, packaged, distributed and sold by independent bottling partners.

We have developed systemwide knowledge-sharing routines and\nprocesses, which include the management of any supply chain challenges. As of the date of this filing, while we have experienced some temporary supply chain disruptions,\nthere has been no material impact, and we do not foresee a material impact, on our and our bottling partners’ ability to manufacture or distribute our products.\n33\n\n\nDespite the pandemic, we are not losing sight of long-term opportunities for our business. The pandemic helped us realize we could be much bolder in our efforts to change. We\nidentified the following key objectives to navigate the pandemic and position us to capture growth: winning more consumers; gaining market share; maintaining strong system\neconomics; strengthening stakeholder impact; and equipping the organization to win. In order to deliver against these objectives, we focused on the following priorities:\nunlocking the potential of our portfolio of strong global, regional and scaled local brands; developing a robust innovation pipeline focusing on scalable initiatives; increasing\nconsumer-centric marketing effectiveness and efficiency; winning in the marketplace with aligned data-driven revenue growth management and execution capabilities; and\nfurther embedding ESG goals into our operations. In August 2020, the Company announced strategic steps to transform our organizational structure to better enable us to\ncapture growth in the fast-changing marketplace. The Company has transformed into a networked global organization designed to combine the power of scale with the deep\nknowledge required to win locally. Refer to Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our strategic realignment initiatives.\nChallenges and Risks\nBeing global provides unique opportunities for our Company. Challenges and risks accompany those opportunities. Our management has identified certain challenges and risks\nthat demand the attention of our Company and the commercial beverage industry. Of these, five key challenges and risks are discussed below.\nObesity\nThe rates of obesity affecting communities, cultures and countries worldwide continue to be too high. There is growing conc",

The estimated impact of a 50 basis-point decrease in the discount rate would result in a $17\nmillion decrease in our 2022 net periodic pension income. Additionally, the estimated impact of a 50 basis-point decrease in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets\nwould result in a $26 million decrease in our 2022 net periodic pension income.\nThe sensitivity information provided above is based only on changes to the actuarial assumptions used for our U.S. pension plans. As of December 31, 2021, the Company’s\nprimary U.S. pension plan represented 61 percent and 57 percent of the Company’s consolidated projected benefit obligation and pension plan assets, respectively.

Typically, structural\nchanges do not impact the Company’s unit case volume or concentrate sales volume on a consolidated basis or at the geographic operating segment level. We recognize unit\ncase volume for all sales of Company beverage products, regardless of our ownership interest in the bottling partner, if any. However, the unit case volume reported by our\nBottling Investments operating segment is generally impacted by structural changes because it only includes the unit case volume of our consolidated bottling operations.

Typically, the Company has not reported unit case volume or recognized concentrate sales volume\nrelated to acquired brands in periods prior to the closing of a transaction. Therefore, the unit case volume and concentrate sales volume related to an acquired brand are\nincremental to prior year volume. We generally do not consider the acquisition of a brand to be a structural change.\n“Licensed brands” refers to brands not owned by the Company but for which we hold certain rights, generally including, but not limited to, distribution rights, and from which\nwe derive an economic benefit when the products are sold. Typically, the Company has not reported unit case volume or recognized concentrate sales volume related to a\nlicensed brand in periods prior to the beginning of the term of a license agreement. Therefore, in the year that a license agreement is entered into, the unit case volume and\nconcentrate sales volume related to a licensed brand are incremental to prior year volume. We generally do not consider the licensing of a brand to be a structural change.\nIn 2021, the Company acquired the remaining ownership interest in BA Sports Nutrition, LLC (“BodyArmor”).

In addition, certain rating agencies also consider the financial\ninformation of certain bottlers, including CCEP, Coca-Cola Consolidated, Inc., Coca-Cola FEMSA and Coca-Cola Hellenic. While the Company has no legal obligation for the\ndebt of these bottlers, the rating agencies believe the strategic importance of the bottlers to the Company’s business model provides the Company with an incentive to keep\nthese bottlers viable. It is our expectation that these rating agencies will continue using this methodology. If our credit ratings were to be downgraded as a result of changes in\nour capital structure, our major bottlers’ financial performance, changes in the credit rating agencies’ methodology in assessing our credit strength, or for any other reason, our\ncost of borrowing could increase. Additionally, if certain bottlers’ credit ratings were to decline, the Company’s equity income could be reduced as a result of the potential\nincrease in interest expense for those bottlers.\nWe monitor our financial ratios and, as indicated above, the rating agencies consider these ratios in assessing our credit ratings. Each rating agency employs a different\naggregation methodology and has different thresholds for the various financial ratios. These thresholds are not necessarily permanent, nor are they always fully disclosed to our\nCompany.\nOur global presence and strong capital position give us access to key financial marke",

We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. As a matter of policy, all of our derivative positions are used to reduce risk by\nhedging an underlying economic exposure. Because of the high correlation between the hedging instruments and the underlying exposures, fluctuations in the values of the\ninstruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the values of the underlying exposures.\nWe monitor our exposure to market risks using several objective measurement systems, including a sensitivity analysis to measure our exposure to fluctuations in foreign\ncurrency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Refer to Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our hedging\ntransactions and derivative financial instruments.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rates\nWe manage most of our foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis, which allows us to net certain exposures and take advantage of any natural offsets. In 2021, we\nused 70 functional currencies in addition to the U.S. dollar and generated $25.6 billion of our net operating revenues from operations outside the United States; therefore,\nweakness in some currencies may be offset by strength in other currencies over time. We use derivative financial instruments to further reduce our net exposure to foreign\ncurrency fluctuations.\nOur Company enters into forward exchange contracts and purchases foreign currency options and collars (principally euro, British pound sterling and Japanese yen) to hedge\ncertain portions of forecasted cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. Additionally, we enter into forward exchange contracts to offset the earnings impact related to\nforeign currency fluctuations on certain monetary assets and liabilities.

These values included\nderivative instruments that are designated and qualify for hedge accounting as well as economic hedges.

Refer to Note 5 for additional information related to the Company’s fair value hedges of available-for-sale debt securities.\nEquity securities with readily determinable fair values that are not accounted for under the equity method and debt securities classified as trading are not assessed for\nimpairment, since they are carried at fair value with the change in fair value included in net income. Equity method investments, equity securities without readily determinable\nfair values and debt securities classified as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity are reviewed each reporting period to determine whether a significant event or change in\ncircumstances has occurred that may have an adverse effect on the fair value of each investment. When such events or changes occur, we evaluate the fair value compared to\nour cost basis in the investment. We also perform this evaluation every reporting period for each investment for which our cost basis has exceeded the fair value. The fair values\nof most of our Company’s investments in publicly traded companies are often readily available based on quoted market prices. For investments in nonpublicly traded\ncompanies, management’s assessment of fair value is based on valuation methodologies including discounted cash flows, estimates of sales proceeds and appraisals, as\nappropriate. We consider the assumptions that we believe a market participant would use in evaluating estimated future cash flows when employing the discounted cash flow or\nestimates of sales proceeds valuation methodologies. The ability to accurately predict future cash flows, especially in emerging and developing markets, may impact the\ndetermination of fair value. In the event the fair value of an investment declines below our cost basis, management is required to determine if the decline in fair value is other\nthan temporary. If management determines the decline is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded.

Refer to Note 5 for additional information related to the Company’s fair value hedges of available-for-sale debt securities.\nEquity securities with readily determinable fair values that are not accounted for under the equity method and debt securities classified as trading are not assessed for\nimpairment, since they are carried at fair value with the change in fair value included in net income. Equity method investments, equity securities without readily determinable\nfair values and debt securities classified as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity are reviewed each reporting period to determine whether a significant event or change in\ncircumstances has occurred that may have an adverse effect on the fair value of each investment. When such events or changes occur, we evaluate the fair value compared to\nour cost basis in the investment. We also perform this evaluation every reporting period for each investment for which our cost basis has exceeded the fair value. The fair values\nof most of our Company’s investments in publicly traded companies are often readily available based on quoted market prices. For investments in nonpublicly traded\ncompanies, management’s assessment of fair value is based on valuation methodologies including discounted cash flows, estimates of sales proceeds and appraisals, as\nappropriate. We consider the assumptions that we believe a market participant would use in evaluating estimated future cash flows when employing the discounted cash flow or\nestimates of sales proceeds valuation methodologies. The ability to accurately predict future cash flows, especially in emerging and developing markets, may impact the\ndetermination of fair value. In the event the fair value of an investment declines below our cost basis, management is required to determine if the decline in fair value is other\nthan temporary. If management determines the decline is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded. Management’s assessment as to the nature of a decline in fair\nvalue is based on, among other things, the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our cost basis; the financial condition and near-term\nprospects of the issuer; and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.\nEquity Securities\nThe carrying values of our equity securities were included in the following line items in our consolidated balance sheets (in millions):\nFair Value with Changes\nRecognized in Income\nMeasurement Alternative\n—\nNo Readily Determinable\nFair Value\nDecember 31, 2021\nMarketable securities\n$\n376  $\n— \nOther investments\n771 \n47 \nOther noncurrent assets\n1,576 \n— \n",

An option contract is an agreement that conveys the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a quantity of a currency or commodity at a\npredetermined rate or price during a period or at a time in the future.

A swap agreement is a contract between two parties to exchange cash flows based on specified\nunderlying notional amounts, assets and/or indices. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. The Company may also designate certain non-\nderivative instruments, such as our foreign currency denominated third-party debt, in hedging relationships.\nAll derivative instruments are carried at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet, primarily in the following line items, as applicable: prepaid expenses and other current\nassets; other noncurrent assets; accounts payable and accrued expenses; and other noncurrent liabilities.

As a result of applying the new\nhedging standard to our fair value hedges on January 1, 2019, we recorded a $24 million increase to our hedged long-term debt balances, with a corresponding decrease to the\nopening balance of reinvested earnings of $18 million, net of taxes.\nThe following table presents the fair values of the Company’s derivative instruments that were designated and qualified as part of a hedging relationship (in millions):\n \nFair Value\nDerivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments\nBalance Sheet Location\nDecember 31,\n2021\nDecember 31,\n2020\nAssets:\n \n \n \nForeign currency contracts\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\n$\n151  $\n26 \nForeign currency contracts\nOther noncurrent assets\n27 \n74 \nCommodity contracts\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\n— \n2 \nInterest rate contracts\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\n1 \n— \nInterest rate contracts\nOther noncurrent assets\n282 \n659 \nTotal assets\n \n$\n461  $\n761 \nLiabilities:\n \n \n \nForeign currency contracts\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses\n$\n15  $\n29 \nForeign currency contracts\nOther noncurrent liabilities\n17 \n— \nInterest rate contracts\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses\n— \n5 \nInterest rate contracts\nOther noncurrent liabilities\n14 \n— \nTotal liabilities\n \n$\n46  $\n34 \nAll of the Company’s derivative instruments are carried at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets after considering the impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash\ncollateral held or placed with the same counterparties, as applicable.

As a result of the IRS’ designation of the Company’s matter for litigation, the Company was forced to either accept the IRS’ newly\nimposed tax assessment and pay the full amount of the asserted tax or litigate the matter in the federal courts. The matter remains subject to the IRS’ litigation designation,\npreventing the Company from any attempt to settle or otherwise mutually resolve the matter with the IRS.\nThe Company consequently initiated litigation by filing a petition in the U.S. Tax Court (“Tax Court”) in December 2015, challenging the tax adjustments enumerated in the\nNotice.\nPrior to trial, the IRS increased its transfer pricing adjustment by $385 million, resulting in an additional tax adjustment of $135 million. The Company obtained a summary\njudgment in its favor on a different matter related to Mexican foreign tax credits, which thereafter effectively reduced the IRS’ potential tax adjustment by approximately\n$138 million.\nThe trial was held in the Tax Court from March through May 2018, and final post-trial briefs were filed and exchanged in April 2019.\nOn November 18, 2020, the Tax Court issued an opinion (“Opinion”) in which it predominantly sided with the IRS but agreed with the Company that dividends previously paid\nby the foreign licensees to the U.S. parent company in reliance upon the Closing Agreement should continue to be allowed to offset royalties, including those that would\nbecome payable to the Company in accordance with the Opinion. The Tax Court reserved ruling on the effect of Brazilian legal restrictions on the payment of royalties by the\nCompany’s licensee in Brazil until after the Tax Court issues its opinion in the separate case of 3M Co. & Subs. v. Commissioner, T.C. Docket No. 5816-13 (filed March 11,\n2013). Once the Tax Court issues its opinion in 3M Co. & Subs. v. Commissioner, the Company expects the Tax Court thereafter to render another opinion, and ultimately a\nfinal decision, in the Company’s case.\nThe Company believes that the IRS and the Tax Court misinterpreted and misapplied the applicable regulations in reallocating income earned by the Company’s foreign\nlicensees to increase the Company’s U.S. tax. Moreover, the Company believes that the retroactive imposition of such tax liability using a calculation methodology different\nfrom that previously agreed upon by the IRS and the Company, and audited by the IRS for over a decade, is unconstitutional. The Company intends to assert its claims on\nappeal and vigorously defend its position.\nIn determining the amount of tax reserve to be recorded as of December 31, 2020, the Company completed the required two-step evaluation process prescribed by Accounting\nStandards Codification 740, Accounting for Income Taxes. In doing so, we consulted with outside advisors and we reviewed and considered relevant laws, rules, and\nregulations, including, but not limited to, the Opinion and relevant caselaw. ",

As a result of the IRS’ designation of the Company’s matter for litigation, the Company was forced to either accept the IRS’ newly\nimposed tax assessment and pay the full amount of the asserted tax or litigate the matter in the federal courts. The matter remains subject to the IRS’ litigation designation,\npreventing the Company from any attempt to settle or otherwise mutually resolve the matter with the IRS.\nThe Company consequently initiated litigation by filing a petition in the U.S. Tax Court (“Tax Court”) in December 2015, challenging the tax adjustments enumerated in the\nNotice.\nPrior to trial, the IRS increased its transfer pricing adjustment by $385 million, resulting in an additional tax adjustment of $135 million. The Company obtained a summary\njudgment in its favor on a different matter related to Mexican foreign tax credits, which thereafter effectively reduced the IRS’ potential tax adjustment by approximately\n$138 million.\nThe trial was held in the Tax Court from March through May 2018, and final post-trial briefs were filed and exchanged in April 2019.\nOn November 18, 2020, the Tax Court issued an opinion (“Opinion”) in which it predominantly sided with the IRS but agreed with the Company that dividends previously paid\nby the foreign licensees to the U.S. parent company in reliance upon the Closing Agreement should continue to be allowed to offset royalties, including those that would\nbecome payable to the Company in accordance with the Opinion. The Tax Court reserved ruling on the effect of Brazilian legal restrictions on the payment of royalties by the\nCompany’s licensee in Brazil until after the Tax Court issues its opinion in the separate case of 3M Co. & Subs. v. Commissioner, T.C. Docket No. 5816-13 (filed March 11,\n2013). Once the Tax Court issues its opinion in 3M Co. & Subs. v. Commissioner, the Company expects the Tax Court thereafter to render another opinion, and ultimately a\nfinal decision, in the Company’s case.\nThe Company believes that the IRS and the Tax Court misinterpreted and misapplied the applicable regulations in reallocating income earned by the Company’s foreign\nlicensees to increase the Company’s U.S. tax. Moreover, the Company believes that the retroactive imposition of such tax liability using a calculation methodology different\nfrom that previously agreed upon by the IRS and the Company, and audited by the IRS for over a decade, is unconstitutional. The Company intends to assert its claims on\nappeal and vigorously defend its position.\nIn determining the amount of tax reserve to be recorded as of December 31, 2020, the Company completed the required two-step evaluation process prescribed by Accounting\nStandards Codification 740, Accounting for Income Taxes. In doing so, we consulted with outside advisors and we reviewed and considered relevant laws, rules, and\nregulations, including, but not limited to, the Opinion and relevant caselaw. ",

The decrease was\npartially offset by an increase in the valuation allowance due to increases in the deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances on certain equity method investments and\nan increase due to the acquisition of foreign operations.\nNOTE 15: OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nAOCI attributable to shareowners of The Coca-Cola Company is separately presented in our consolidated balance sheet as a component of The Coca-Cola Company’s\nshareowners’ equity, which also includes our proportionate share of equity method investees’ AOCI.

Additionally, the Company adjusts the carrying value of certain long-term debt as a result of the\nCompany’s fair value hedging strategy.\nInvestments in Debt and Equity Securities\nThe fair values of our investments in debt and equity securities using quoted market prices from daily exchange traded markets are based on the closing price as of the balance\nsheet date and are classified as Level 1. The fair values of our investments in debt and equity securities classified as Level 2 are priced using quoted market prices for similar\ninstruments or nonbinding market prices that are corroborated by observable market data. Inputs into these valuation techniques include actual trade data, benchmark yields,\nbroker/dealer quotes and other similar data. These inputs are obtained from quoted market prices, independent pricing vendors or other sources.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe fair values of our futures contracts are primarily determined using quoted contract prices on futures exchange markets. The fair values of these instruments are based on the\nclosing contract prices as of the balance sheet date and are classified as Level 1.\nThe fair values of our derivative instruments other than futures are determined using standard valuation models. The significant inputs used in these models are readily\navailable in public markets, or can be derived from observable market transactions, and therefore have been classified as Level 2. Inputs used in these standard valuation\nmodels for derivative instruments other than futures include the applicable exchange rates, forward rates, interest rates, discount rates and commodity prices. The standard\nvaluation model for options also uses implied volatility as an additional input. The discount rates are based on the historical U.S. Deposit or U.S. Treasury rates, and the implied\nvolatility specific to options is based on quoted rates from financial institutions.\nIncluded in the fair values of derivative instruments is an adjustment for nonperformance risk.

Additionally, the Company adjusts the carrying value of certain long-term debt as a result of the\nCompany’s fair value hedging strategy.\nInvestments in Debt and Equity Securities\nThe fair values of our investments in debt and equity securities using quoted market prices from daily exchange traded markets are based on the closing price as of the balance\nsheet date and are classified as Level 1. The fair values of our investments in debt and equity securities classified as Level 2 are priced using quoted market prices for similar\ninstruments or nonbinding market prices that are corroborated by observable market data. Inputs into these valuation techniques include actual trade data, benchmark yields,\nbroker/dealer quotes and other similar data. These inputs are obtained from quoted market prices, independent pricing vendors or other sources.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe fair values of our futures contracts are primarily determined using quoted contract prices on futures exchange markets. The fair values of these instruments are based on the\nclosing contract prices as of the balance sheet date and are classified as Level 1.\nThe fair values of our derivative instruments other than futures are determined using standard valuation models. The significant inputs used in these models are readily\navailable in public markets, or can be derived from observable market transactions, and therefore have been classified as Level 2. Inputs used in these standard valuation\nmodels for derivative instruments other than futures include the applicable exchange rates, forward rates, interest rates, discount rates and commodity prices. The standard\nvaluation model for options also uses implied volatility as an additional input. The discount rates are based on the historical U.S. Deposit or U.S. Treasury rates, and the implied\nvolatility specific to options is based on quoted rates from financial institutions.\nIncluded in the fair values of derivative instruments is an adjustment for nonperformance risk. The adjustment is based on current credit default swap (“CDS”) rates applied to\neach contract, by counterparty. We use our counterparty’s CDS rate when we are in an asset position and our own CDS rate when we are in a liability position.

The operating income for the years ended December 31, 2021, is $2,534 million for Latin America, $3,331 million for North America, $2,325 million for Asia Pacific, $293 million for Global Ventures, and $473 million for Bottling Investments. The operating loss for Corporate is $2,383 million. The interest income is $276 million. The interest expense is $1,597 million. Therefore, the total revenue for FY2021 is approximately $2,534 + $3,331 + $2,325 + $293 + $473 - $2,383 + $276 - $1,597 = $7,488 million.\n   Explanation: The income statement does not directly provide 'Total Revenue' or 'Net Sales' for FY2021. However, it does provide operating income for various segments, which can be used to infer revenue.

This figure is well-supported by multiple outputs and citations.\n   - **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: There are conflicting figures reported, including $15,357 million, $13,433 million, and $14,619 million. However, the figure $15,357 million is cited as being found in the Consolidated Statements of Income, which lends it more credibility.\n\n2. **Sufficiency of Information**:\n   - We have a consistent and credible figure for Total Revenue/Net Sales.\n   - The COGS figure of $15,357 million, while conflicting with other figures, is the most credible due to its citation from the Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\n3. **Missing Information**:\n   - There is no additional missing information required to calculate the COGS % margin, assuming the $15,357 million COGS figure is accurate.\n\n4. **Calculation**:\n   - To calculate the COGS % margin, use the formula:\n     \\[\n     \\text{COGS \\% Margin} = \\left(\\frac{\\text{COGS}}{\\text{Total Revenue}}\\right) \\times 100\n     \\]\n   - Substituting the values:\n     \\[\n     \\text{COGS \\% Margin} = \\left(\\frac{15,357}{38,655}\\right) \\times 100 \\approx 39.73\\%\n     \\]\n\n5. **Conflicting Answers**:\n   - The COGS figure of $15,357 million is selected due to its citation from the Consolidated Statements of Income, which is a primary source and more reliable than other conflicting figures.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the information gathered and the credibility of the sources, we can calculate Coca Cola's FY2021 COGS % margin as approximately 39.73\\%."
