AMEX does not have an improving operating margin profile as of 2022, with an estimated operating margin of 18.0% compared to 25.6% in 2021. However, operating margin may not be a useful metric for AMEX due to its unique business model, which relies heavily on transaction volume and other financial metrics such as net interest margin and return on equity.
