--- Question ---
Does Adobe have an improving operating margin profile as of FY2022? If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
Based on the available information, Adobe's operating margin profile for FY2022 cannot be definitively assessed due to the lack of explicit data. However, inferred calculations suggest a stable margin with potential impacts from strategic investments and market conditions. The operating margin remains a relevant metric for Adobe, as it is affected by various business factors.

--- Ground Truth ---
['No the operating margins of Adobe have recently declined from 36.8% in FY 2021 to 34.6% in FY2022. A drop by 2.2% in a year.']

--- Correctness Evaluation ---
Is correct: False
Confidence: 0.90
Reasoning: The predicted answer does not match the ground truth answer. The ground truth states that Adobe's operating margin declined from 36.8% in FY2021 to 34.6% in FY2022, indicating a decrease. The predicted answer suggests that the operating margin cannot be definitively assessed and implies stability, which contradicts the ground truth. Therefore, the stance does not match exactly, and the key facts and conclusions do not align.
