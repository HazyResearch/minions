Total length: 372666 characters.: \n\n## Question\nHas Microsoft increased its debt on balance sheet between FY2023 and the FY2022 period?\n\n---\n\nPlease provide succinct advice on the critical information we need to extract from the Financial document. Total length: 372666 characters to answer this question. \n\nAlso consider the following constraints:\n- In your response do NOT use numbered lists.\n- Do NOT structure your response as a sequence of steps.\n",
      "output": "To determine whether Microsoft increased its debt on the balance sheet between FY2023 and FY2022, focus on extracting specific financial data from the document. Look for the balance sheet sections for both fiscal years, specifically the liabilities section where debt is reported. Key figures to identify include the total debt or total liabilities for each year. Pay attention to any notes or commentary that might explain changes in debt levels, such as new borrowings, repayments, or adjustments. Additionally, consider any relevant financial ratios or metrics that might provide context to the debt levels, such as debt-to-equity ratio or interest coverage. This information will help you assess whether there has been an increase in debt from FY2022 to FY2023."

      "prompt": "# Decomposition Round #1\n\nYou (the supervisor) cannot directly read the document(s). Instead, you can assign small, isolated tasks to a less capable worker model that sees only a single chunk of text at a time. Any cross-chunk or multi-document reasoning must be handled by you.\n\n## Your Job: Write Two Python Functions\n\n### FUNCTION #1: `prepare_jobs(context, prev_job_manifests, prev_job_outputs) -> List[JobManifest]`\n- Break the document(s) into chunks (using the provided chunking function, if needed). Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 12 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`. All **multi-chunk integration** or **global reasoning** is your responsibility here.\n- Return one **aggregated string** suitable for further supervisor inspection.\n\n\n\n## Relevant Pydantic Models\n\nThe following models are already in the global scope. **Do NOT redefine or re-import them.**\n\n### JobManifest Model\n```\nclass JobManifest(BaseModel):\n    chunk: str  # the actual text for the chunk of the document\n    task: str  # the actual task instruction for the small model\n    advice: str  # optional, any additional advice on how to perform the task\n\n    chunk_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    task_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    job_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n\n```\n\n### JobOutput Model\n```\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    citation: Optional[str]\n    answer: Optional[str]\n\n```\n\n## Function Signatures\n```\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        context (List[str]): A list of documents.

From time to time, we enter into broader cross-license \nagreements with other technology companies covering entire groups of patents. We may also purchase or license technology that we incorporate into our \nproducts and services. At times, we make select intellectual property broadly available at no or low cost to achieve a strategic objective, such as \npromoting industry standards, advancing interoperability, supporting societal and/or environmental efforts, or attracting and enabling our external \ndevelopment community. Our increasing engagement with open source software will also cause us to license our intellectual property rights broadly in \ncertain situations.\nWhile it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products and services, we believe, based upon past \nexperience and industry practice, such licenses generally can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. We believe our continuing research and \nproduct development are not materially dependent on any single license or other agreement with a third party relating to the development of our products. \n17\n\n\nPART I\nItem 1\n \nInvesting in the Future \nOur success is based on our ability to create new and compelling products, services, and experiences for our users, to initiate and embrace disruptive \ntechnology trends, to enter new geographic and product markets, and to drive broad adoption of our products and services. We invest in a range of \nemerging technology trends and breakthroughs that we believe offer significant opportunities to deliver value to our customers and growth for the \ncompany. Based on our assessment of key technology trends, we maintain our long-term commitment to research and development across a wide \nspectrum of technologies, tools, and platforms spanning digital work and life experiences, cloud computing, AI, devices, and operating systems. \nWhile our main product research and development facilities are located in Redmond, Washington, we also operate research and development",

Barriers to entry in many of our \nbusinesses are low and many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies, shifting user needs, and \nfrequent introductions of new products and services. Our ability to remain competitive depends on our success in making innovative products, devices, \nand services that appeal to businesses and consumers.\nCompetition among platform-based ecosystems\nAn important element of our business model has been to create platform-based ecosystems on which many participants can build diverse solutions. A \nwell-established ecosystem creates beneficial network effects among users, application developers, and the platform provider that can accelerate \ngrowth. Establishing significant scale in the marketplace is necessary to achieve and maintain attractive margins. We face significant competition from \nfirms that provide competing platforms.\n•A competing vertically-integrated model, in which a single firm controls the software and hardware elements of a product and related services, \nhas succeeded with some consumer products such as personal computers, tablets, phones, gaming consoles, wearables, and other endpoint \ndevices.

They may also be able to claim security and performance benefits from their \nvertically integrated offer. We also offer some vertically-integrated hardware and software products and services. To the extent we shift a portion \nof our business to a vertically integrated model we increase our cost of revenue and reduce our operating margins.\n•We derive substantial revenue from licenses of Windows operating systems on PCs. We face significant competition from competing platforms \ndeveloped for new devices and form factors such as smartphones and tablet computers. These devices compete on multiple bases including \nprice and the perceived utility of the device and its platform. Users are increasingly turning to these devices to perform functions that in the past \nwere performed by personal computers. Even if many users view these devices as complementary to a personal computer, the prevalence of \nthese devices may make it more difficult to attract application developers to our PC operating system platforms. Competing with operating \nsystems licensed at low or no cost may decrease our PC operating system margins. Popular products or services offered on competing \nplatforms could increase their competitive strength. In addition, some of our devices compete with products made by our original equipment \nmanufacturer (“OEM”) partners, which may affect their commitment to our platform.\n•Competing platforms have content and application marketplaces with scale and significant installed bases. The variety and utility of content and \napplications available on a platform are important to device purchasing decisions. Users may incur costs to move data and buy new content and \napplications when switching platforms. To compete, we must successfully enlist developers to write applications for our platform and ensure that \nthese applications have high quality, security, customer appeal, and value. Efforts to compete with competitors’ content and application \nmarketplaces may increase our cost of revenue and lower our operating margins.

We will bear significant \ndevelopment and operational costs to build and support the AI capabilities, products, and services necessary to meet the needs of our \ncustomers. To compete effectively we must also be responsive to technological change, potential regulatory developments, and public scrutiny.\n•Other competitors develop and offer free applications, online services, and content, and make money by selling third-party advertising. \nAdvertising revenue funds development of products and services these competitors provide to users at no or little cost, competing directly with \nour revenue-generating products.\n•Some companies compete with us by modifying and then distributing open source software at little or no cost to end users, using open source \nAI models, and earning revenue on advertising or integrated products and services. These firms do not bear the full costs of research and \ndevelopment for the open source products. Some open source products mimic the features and functionality of our products.\nThe competitive pressures described above may cause decreased sales volumes, price reductions, and/or increased operating costs, such as for \nresearch and development, marketing, and sales incentives.

Investments in new \ntechnology are speculative. Commercial success depends on many factors, including innovativeness, developer support, and effective distribution and \nmarketing. If customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their purchases of \nnew software and hardware products or upgrades, unfavorably affecting revenue. We may not achieve significant revenue from new product, service, \nand distribution channel investments for several years, if at all. New products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, \noperating margins for some new products and businesses will not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically.

The growth of our Internet- and cloud-based services internationally relies increasingly on the \nmovement of data across national boundaries. Legal requirements relating to the collection, storage, handling, and transfer of personal data continue to \nevolve. For example, while the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“DPF”) has been recognized as adequate under EU law to allow transfers of personal \ndata from the EU to certified companies in the U.S., the DPF is subject to further legal challenge which could cause the legal requirements for data \ntransfers from the EU to be uncertain. EU data protection authorities have and may again block the use of certain U.S.-based services that involve the \ntransfer of data to the U.S. In the EU and other markets, potential new rules and restrictions on the flow of data across borders could increase the cost \nand complexity of delivering our products and services. \nIn addition, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which applies to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the EU or \nrelated to products and services offered in the EU, imposes a range of compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data. More recently, the \nEU has been developing new requirements related to the use of data, including in the Digital Markets Act, the Digital Services Act, and the Data Act, that \nadd additional rules and restriction on the use of data in our products and services.

The litigation and other claims are subject to inherent \nuncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future. A material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements \ncould occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable.\nOur business with government customers may present additional uncertainties. We derive substantial revenue from government contracts. \nGovernment contracts generally can present risks and challenges not present in private commercial agreements. For instance, we may be subject to \ngovernment audits and investigations relating to these contracts, we could be suspended or debarred as a governmental contractor, we could incur civil \nand criminal fines and penalties, and under certain circumstances contracts may be rescinded. Some agreements may allow a government to terminate \nwithout cause and provide for higher liability limits for certain losses. Some contracts may be subject to periodic funding approval, reductions, \ncancellations,  or delays which could adversely impact public-sector demand for our products and services. These events could negatively impact our \nresults of operations, financial condition, and reputation.\nWe may have additional tax liabilities. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in \ndetermining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax \ndetermination is uncertain. For example, compliance with the 2017 United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) and possible future legislative changes \nmay require the collection of information not regularly produced within the company, the use of estimates in our consolidated financial statements, and \nthe exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions.

Although we believe that our provision for income taxes and our tax estimates are \nreasonable, tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken. In addition, economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in \nvarious jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes favorably more difficult.

In addition, changes in U.S. federal and state or international tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, other \nfundamental law changes currently being considered by many countries, including in the U.S., and changes in taxing jurisdictions’ administrative \ninterpretations, decisions, policies, and positions may materially adversely impact our consolidated financial statements.\n33\n\n\nPART I\nItem 1A\n \nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RISKS\nWe face risks related to the protection and utilization of our intellectual property that may result in our business and operating results may be \nharmed. Protecting our intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of our software and other intellectual property on a global \nbasis is difficult. Similarly, the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights.\nChanges in the law may continue to weaken our ability to prevent the use of patented technology or collect revenue for licensing our patents. Additionally, \nlicensees of our patents may fail to satisfy their obligations to pay us royalties or may contest the scope and extent of their obligations. Finally, our \nincreasing engagement with open source software will also cause us to license our intellectual property rights broadly in certain situations. If we are \nunable to protect our intellectual property, our revenue may be adversely affected.\nSource code, the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs, is critical to our business. If our source code \nleaks, we might lose future trade secret protection for that code. It may then become easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying \nfunctionality, which could adversely affect our revenue and operating results. Unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase the security \nrisks described elsewhere in these risk factors.\nThird parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property. From time to time, others claim we infringe their intellectual property rights. To \nresolve these claims, we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on terms that are less favorable than currently available, stop selling or \nredesign affected products or services, or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers.

Our reputation and brands are globally \nrecognized and are important to our business. Our reputation and brands affect our ability to attract and retain consumer, business, and public-sector \ncustomers. There are numerous ways our reputation or brands could be damaged. These include product safety or quality issues, our environmental \nimpact and sustainability, supply chain practices, or human rights record. We may experience backlash from customers, government entities, advocacy \ngroups, employees, and other stakeholders that disagree with our product offering decisions or public policy positions. Damage to our reputation or our \nbrands may occur from, among other things: \n•The introduction of new features, products, services, or terms of service that customers, users, or partners do not like.\n•Public scrutiny of our decisions regarding user privacy, data practices, or content. \n•Data security breaches, compliance failures, or actions of partners or individual employees. \nThe proliferation of social media may increase the likelihood, speed, and magnitude of negative brand events. If our brands or reputation are damaged, it \ncould negatively impact our revenues or margins, or ability to attract the most highly qualified employees.\nAdverse economic or market conditions may harm our business. Worsening economic conditions, including inflation, recession, pandemic, or other \nchanges in economic conditions, may cause lower IT spending and adversely affect our revenue. If demand for PCs, servers, and other computing \ndevices declines, or consumer or business spending for those products declines, our revenue will be adversely affected. \nOur product distribution system relies on an extensive partner and retail network. OEMs building devices that run our software have also been a \nsignificant means of distribution. The impact of economic conditions on our partners, such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor, OEM, or retailer, could \ncause sales channel disruption. \nChallenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased. As a result, \nallowances for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase. \n34\n\n\nPART I\nItem 1A\n \nWe maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities.

A disruption or failure of our systems or operations because of a major \nearthquake, weather event, cyberattack, terrorist attack, pandemic, or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales, providing \nservices, or performing other critical functions. Our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, and certain \nother essential business operations are in the Seattle, Washington area, and we have other business operations in the Silicon Valley area of California, \nboth of which are seismically active regions. A catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or IT systems, \nor the infrastructure or systems they rely on, such as power grids, could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations. Providing our customers \nwith more services and solutions in the cloud puts a premium on the resilience of our systems and strength of our business continuity management plans \nand magnifies the potential impact of prolonged service outages in our consolidated financial statements. \nAbrupt political change, terrorist activity, and armed conflict, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, pose a risk of general economic disruption in \naffected countries, which may increase our operating costs and negatively impact our ability to sell to and collect from customers in affected markets. \nThese conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers and may cause supply chain \ndisruptions for hardware manufacturers.

Changes to trade policy or agreements as a result of populism, protectionism, or economic nationalism may result in higher \ntariffs, local sourcing initiatives, and non-local sourcing restrictions, export controls, investment restrictions, or other developments that make it more \ndifficult to sell our products in foreign countries. Disruptions of these kinds in developed or emerging markets could negatively impact demand for our \nproducts and services,  impair our ability to operate in certain regions, or increase operating costs.

Each industry shift is an opportunity to \nconceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business. At Microsoft, we push the boundaries of \nwhat is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers and \nusers, industry trends, and competitive forces.\n40\n\n\nPART II\nItem 7\n \nEconomic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks\nThe markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors are developing new software and \ndevices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses. The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve \nrapidly, influencing how users access services in the cloud and, in some cases, the user’s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. \nAggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is also correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic. \nWe must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment. \nThe investments we are making in cloud and AI infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating \nmargins. We continue to identify and evaluate opportunities to expand our datacenter locations and increase our server capacity to meet the evolving \nneeds of our customers, particularly given the growing demand for AI services. Our datacenters depend on the availability of permitted and buildable \nland, predictable energy, networking supplies, and servers, including graphics processing units (“GPUs”) and other components. Our devices are \nprimarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers. For the majority of our products, we have the ability to use other manufacturers if a current \nvendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements. However, some of our products contain certain components for which there are very \nfew qualified suppliers. Extended disruptions at these suppliers could impact our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand. \nOur success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide. We \ncompete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow \none’s career across many different products and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits.\nOur international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue and expenses are denominated in \ncurrencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect reve",

Fluctuations in the \nU.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies reduced reported revenue and expenses from our international operations in fiscal year 2023.\nOn January 18, 2023, we announced decisions we made to align our cost structure with our revenue and customer demand, prioritize our investments in \nstrategic areas, and consolidate office space. As a result, we recorded a $1.2 billion charge in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023 (“Q2 charge”), \nwhich included employee severance expenses of $800 million, impairment charges resulting from changes to our hardware portfolio, and costs related to \nlease consolidation activities. First, we reduced our overall workforce by approximately 10,000 jobs through the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 related to \nthe Q2 charge, which represents less than 5% of our total employee base. While we eliminated roles in some areas, we will continue to hire in key \nstrategic areas. Second, we are allocating both our capital and talent to areas of secular growth and long-term competitiveness, while divesting in other \nareas. Third, we are consolidating our leases to create higher density across our workspaces, which impacted our financial results through the remainder \nof fiscal year 2023, and we may make similar decisions in future periods as we continue to evaluate our real estate needs.\nRefer to Risk Factors (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K) for a discussion of these factors and other risks.\nSeasonality\nOur revenue fluctuates quarterly and is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. Second quarter revenue is driven by \ncorporate year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers, and fourth quarter revenue is driven by the \nvolume of multi-year on-premises contracts executed during the period. \nChange in Accounting Estimate\nIn July 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment. Due to investments in software that increased \nefficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well as advances in technology, we determined we should increase the estimated \nuseful lives of both server and network equipment from four years to six years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning fiscal year \n2023. Based on the carrying amount of server and network equipment included in property and equipment, net as of June 30, 2022, the effect of this \nchange in estimate for fiscal year 2023 was an increase in operating income of $3.7 billion and net income of $3.0 billion, or $0.40 per both basic and \ndiluted share.\n41\n\n\nPART II\nItem 7\n \nReportable Segments\nWe report our financial performance based on the following segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal \nComputing.

Interest expense decreased due to a decrease in \noutstanding long-term debt due to debt maturities. Net recognized gains on investments decreased due to lower gains on equity securities and higher \nlosses on fixed income securities. Net losses on derivatives increased due to losses related to managing strategic investments. \nINCOME TAXES \nEffective Tax Rate\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal years 2023 and 2022 was 19% and 13%, respectively. The increase in our effective tax rate was primarily due to a $3.3 \nbillion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 related to the transfer of intangible properties and a decrease in tax benefits relating to \nstock-based compensation.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we transferred certain intangible properties from our Puerto Rico subsidiary to the U.S. The transfer of intangible \nproperties resulted in a $3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, as the value of future U.S. tax deductions exceeded the \ncurrent tax liability from the U.S. global intangible low-taxed income tax.\nOur effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from \nproducing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations center in Ireland.\nThe mix of income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries impacted our effective tax rate as a result of the geographic distribution \nof, and customer demand for, our products and services. In fiscal year 2023, our U.S. income before income taxes was $52.9 billion and our foreign \nincome before income taxes was $36.4 billion. In fiscal year 2022, our U.S. income before income taxes was $47.8 billion and our foreign income before \nincome taxes was $35.9 billion.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nWe settled a portion of the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 in fiscal year 2011.

In \nthe second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we settled an additional portion of the IRS audits for tax years 2004 to 2013 and made a payment of $1.7 billion, \nincluding tax and interest.

We believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We have not received a \nproposed assessment for the unresolved key transfer pricing issues. We do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on \nthe information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 \nmonths.\nWe are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years \n1996 to 2022, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our \nconsolidated financial statements.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nAdjusted gross margin, operating income, net income, and diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures. Current year non-GAAP financial measures \nexclude the impact of the Q2 charge, which includes employee severance expenses, impairment charges resulting from changes to our hardware \nportfolio, and costs related to lease consolidation activities. Prior year non-GAAP financial measures  exclude the net income tax benefit related to \ntransfer of intangible properties in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. We believe these non-GAAP measures aid investors by providing additional insight \ninto our operational performance and help clarify trends affecting our business. For comparability of reporting, management considers non-GAAP \nmeasures in conjunction with GAAP financial results in evaluating business performance.

Equity \ninvestments were $9.9 billion and $6.9 billion as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our short-term investments are primarily intended to facilitate \nliquidity and capital preservation. They consist predominantly of highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and \nindividual issuers. The investments are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities to \ndiversify risk. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. The credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income \nportfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income indices. The settlement risk related to these investments is \ninsignificant given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities. \nValuation \nIn general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial \ninstruments.

If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar \nassets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 \ninvestments, such as commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed \nsecurities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities. Level 3 investments are valued using internally-developed models with unobservable \ninputs. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio. \nA majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted \nmarket price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. Broker pricing is used mainly when a \nquoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in \nwhich the investment trades. Our broker-priced investments are generally classified as Level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments \nbased on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to \ndemonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure \nappropriate fair values are recorded.

Cash used in financing decreased $14.9 billion to $43.9 \nbillion for fiscal year 2023, mainly due to a $10.5 billion decrease in common stock repurchases and a $6.3 billion decrease in repayments of debt, offset \nin part by a $1.7 billion increase in dividends paid. Cash used in investing decreased $7.6 billion to $22.7 billion for fiscal year 2023, due to a $20.4 billion \ndecrease in cash used for acquisitions of companies, net of cash acquired, and purchases of intangible and other assets, offset in part by a $8.2 billion \ndecrease in cash from net investment purchases, sales, and maturities, and a $4.2 billion increase in additions to property and equipment.\n50\n\n\nPART II\nItem 7\n \nDebt Proceeds\nWe issue debt to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidit",

Determining whether products and services \nare considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-\nbased service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is \nconsidered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time.

Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which \nthe cloud services are provided. \nJudgment is required to determine the stand-alone selling price (“SSP\") for each distinct performance obligation. We use a single amount to estimate \nSSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates provided at no additional charge. We use a \nrange of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be \nallocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services. \nIn instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using \ninformation that may include market conditions and",

We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services \ndue to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of \nthe customer and geographic region in determining the SSP. \nDue to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including the exercise pattern \nof certain benefits across our portfolio of customers. \nOur products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of \nour products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits \nare estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. Changes to our estimated \nvariable consideration were not material for the periods presented. \nImpairment of Investment Securities \nWe review debt investments quarterly for credit losses and impairment. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other \nfactors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to which the fair value is less than cost. This determination \nrequires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative \nevidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and \nbusiness outlook for, the investee. If we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before \nrecovery, then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the \ninvestment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. \nEquity investments without readily determinable fair values are written down to fair value if a qualitative assessment indicates that the investment is \nimpaired and the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. We perform a qualitative assessment on a periodic basis. We are required to \nestimate the fair value of the investment to determine the amount of the impairment loss. Once an investment is determined to be impaired, an \nimpairment charge is recorded in other income (expense), net. \n53\n\n\nPART II\nItem 7\n \nGoodwill \nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination.

These events or circumstances \ncould include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a \nsignificant portion of a reporting unit. \nApplication of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to \nreporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is \nestimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future \ncash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which \ncash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. \nThe estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other \nfactors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting \nunit. \nResearch and Development Costs \nCosts incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been \nestablished for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to \ncustomers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological \nfeasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. Generally, this \noccurs shortly before the products are released to production. The amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the \nproducts. \nLegal and Other Contingencies \nThe outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss from a loss contingency such \nas a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the \namount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of \nprobability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss.

We recognize the tax \nbenefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based \non the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest \nbenefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of \nincome tax assets and liabilities, classification of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax \npositions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our \nconsolidated financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our \nconsolidated financial statements. \nInventories \nInventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead \nrelated to the purchase and production of inventories. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion, disposal, and \ntransportation. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our \ninventory. These reviews include analysis of demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, pricing \nstrategy, and component cost trends. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis \nthrough a charge to cost of revenue.\n55\n\n\nPART II\nItem 7\n \nSTATEMENT OF MANAGEMENT’S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \nManagement is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related information that are presented in this report.

The recast of these prior period amounts had no impact on \nour consolidated balance sheets, consolidated income statements, or consolidated cash flows statements. \nPrinciples of Consolidation \nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances have \nbeen eliminated. \nEstimates and Assumptions \nPreparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, \nand expenses. Examples of estimates and assumptions include: for revenue recognition, determining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance \nobligations, and determining the standalone selling price (“SSP”) of performance obligations, variable consideration, and other obligations such as \nproduct returns and refunds; loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of and/or potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for our \nreporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; the market value of, and demand \nfor, our inventory; stock-based compensation forfeiture rates; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of \nuncertain tax positions that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and determining the timing and amount of \nimpairments for investments. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management’s estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties.\nIn July 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment. Due to investments in software that increased \nefficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well as advances in technology, we determined we should increase the estimated \nuseful lives of both server and network equipment from four years to six years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning fiscal year \n2023. Based on the carrying amount of server and network equipment included in property and equipment, net as of June 30, 2022, the effect of this \nchange in estimate for fi",

Revenue and expenses are translated \nat average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive \nincome. \nRevenue\nProduct Revenue and Service and Other Revenue \nProduct revenue includes sales from operating systems, cross-device productivity and collaboration applications, server applications, business solution \napplications, desktop and server management tools, software development tools, video games, and hardware such as PCs, tablets, gaming and \nentertainment consoles, other intelligent devices, and related accessories. \nService and other revenue includes sales from cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services, platforms, and content such as \nOffice 365, Azure, Dynamics 365, and Xbox; solution support; and consulting services. Service and other revenue also includes sales from online \nadvertising and LinkedIn.\n63\n\n\nPART II\nItem 8\n \nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to \nreceive in exchange for those products or services. We enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which are \ngenerally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any \ntaxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. \nNature of Products and Services\nLicenses for on-premises software provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists when made available to the customer. Customers \nmay purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses, which provide customers with the same functionality and differ mainly in the duration over \nwhich the customer benefits from the software. Revenue from distinct on-premises licenses is recognized upfront at the point in time when the software \nis made available to the customer. In cases where we allocate revenue to software updates, primarily because the updates are provided at no additional \ncharge, revenue is recognized as the updates are provided, which is generally ratably over the estimated life of the related device or license.\nCertain volume licensing programs, including Enterprise Agreements, include on-premises licenses combined with Software Assurance (“SA”). SA \nconveys rights to new software and upgrades released over the contract period and provides support, tools, and training to help customers deploy and \nuse products more efficiently.

Revenue related to cloud services provided on a subscription basis is recognized ratably over the contract period. \nRevenue related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis, such as the amount of storage used in a period, is recognized based on the \ncustomer utilization of such resources. When cloud services require a significant level of integration and interdependency with software and the individual \ncomponents are not considered distinct, all revenue is recognized over the period in which the cloud services are provided. \nRevenue from search advertising is recognized when the advertisement appears in the search results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue \nhas been completed. Revenue from consulting services is recognized as services are provided. \nOur hardware is generally highly dependent on, and interrelated with, the underlying operating system and cannot function without the operating system. \nIn these cases, the hardware and software license are accounted for as a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at the point in time \nwhen ownership is transferred to resellers or directly to end customers through retail stores and online marketplaces. \nRefer to Note 19 – Segment Information and Geographic Data for further information, including revenue by significant product and service offering.\nSignificant Judgments\nOur contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services \nare considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-\nbased service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is \nconsidered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. Certain \ncloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and \ncloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which \nthe cloud services are provided.\n64\n\n\nPART II\nItem 8\n \nJudgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation.

Returns and credits \nare estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. Changes to our estimated \nvariable consideration were not material for the periods presented.\nContract Balances and Other Receivables \nTiming of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. We record a receivable when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing, \nor unearned revenue when revenue is recognized subsequent to invoicing. For multi-year agreements, we generally invoice customers annually at the \nbeginning of each annual coverage period. We record a receivable related to revenue recognized for multi-year on-premises licenses as we have an \nunconditional right to invoice and receive payment in the future related to those licenses. \nUnearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include SA and cloud services.

Unearned revenue also includes payments for consulting services to be performed in the future, LinkedIn subscriptions, Office 365 subscriptions, \nXbox subscriptions, Windows post-delivery support, Dynamics business solutions, and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn \nthe revenue when we transfer control of the product or service. \nRefer to Note 13 – Unearned Revenue for further information, including unearned revenue by segment and changes in unearned revenue during the \nperiod.\nPayment terms and conditions vary by contract type, alt",

          "chunk": " 8\n \nFinancial Instruments\nInvestments\nWe consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The fair \nvalues of these investments approximate their carrying values. In general, investments with original maturities of greater than three months and \nremaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as \nshort-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current \noperations. \nDebt investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. Changes in fair \nvalue, excluding credit losses and impairments, are recorded in other comprehensive income. Fair value is calculated based on publicly available market \ninformation or other estimates determined by management. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general \nmarket conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to which the fair value is less than cost. To determine credit losses, we employ \na systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence. In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to \nthe financial health of, and business outlook for, the investee. If we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to \nsell the security before recovery, then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in other income (expense), net and a new \ncost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.\nEquity investments with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are \nmeasured using the equity method or measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments (referred to as the \nmeasurement alternative). We perform a qualitative assessment on a periodic basis and recognize an impairment if there are sufficient indicators that the \nfair value of the investment is less than carrying value. Changes in value are recorded in other income (expense), net. \nDerivatives\nDerivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a \nderivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. \nFor derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, gains and losses are recognized in other income (expense), net with offsetting gains and \nlosses on the hedged items.

The hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the extent to which inputs used in \nmeasuring fair value are observable in the market. We categorize each of our fair value measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest \nlevel input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. These levels are: \n•Level 1 – inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Our Level 1 investments include U.S. \ngovernment securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. Our Level 1 derivative assets and liabilities include those actively traded \non exchanges. \n•Level 2 – inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in \nmarkets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques (e.g. the Black-Scholes model) for which all significant inputs are observable \nin the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Where applicable, these \nmodels project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including interest \nrate curves, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for currencies. Our Level 2 investments include commercial \npaper, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and \nbonds, and municipal securities. Our Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities include certain cleared swap contracts and over-the-counter \nforward, option, and swap contracts.\n•Level 3 – inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in \npricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques, including option pricing models and \ndiscounted cash flow models. Our Level 3 assets and liabilities include investments in corporate notes and bonds, municipal securities, and \ngoodwill and intangible assets, when they are recorded at fair value due to an impairment charge. Unobservable inputs used in the models are \nsignificant to the fair values of the assets and l",

The fair values of these investments are determined \nbased on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash \nflow projections. \nOur other current financial assets and current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values.\nInventories \nInventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead \nrelated to the purchase and production of inventories. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion, disposal, and \ntransportation. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our \ninventory. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of \nrevenue. \nProperty and Equipment \nProperty and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, and depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated \nuseful life of the asset or the lease term. The estimated useful lives of our property and equipment are generally as follows: computer software developed \nor acquired for internal use, three  years; computer equipment, two to six years; buildings and improvements, five to 15 years; leasehold improvements, \nthree to 20 years; and furniture and equipment, one to 10 years. Land is not depreciated. \nLeases\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets, other current \nliabilities, and operating lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, other current \nliabilities, and other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. \n69\n\n\nPART II\nItem 8\n \nROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising \nfrom the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over \nthe lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we generally use our incremental borrowing rate based on the estimated rate of \ninterest for collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at commencement date. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any \nlease payments made and excludes lease incentives. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain \nthat we will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. \nWe have lease agr",

For certain equipment leases, such as \nvehicles, we account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. Additionally, for certain equipment leases, we apply a \nportfolio approach to effectively account for the operating lease ROU assets and liabilities. \nGoodwill \nGoodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1) and \nbetween annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its \ncarrying value. \nIntangible Assets \nOur intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit, ranging from \none to 20 years. We evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by taking into account events or circumstances that may warrant revised \nestimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset may be impaired. \nNOTE 2 — EARNINGS PER SHARE\nBasic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted \nEPS is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding \nduring the period using the treasury stock method.

We manage the average maturity of our \nfixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain broad-based fixed-income indices using option, futures, and swap contracts. \nThese contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are included in “Other contracts” in the tables below.\nEquity \nSecurities held in our equity investments portfolio are subject to market price risk. At times, we may hold options, futures, and swap contracts. These \ncontracts are not designated as hedging instruments.\nCredit \nOur fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. We use credit default swap contracts to manage credit \nexposures relative to broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are \nincluded in “Other contracts” in the tables below.\nCredit-Risk-Related Contingent Features \nCertain of our counterparty agreements for derivative instruments contain provisions that require our issued and outstanding long-term unsecured debt to \nmaintain an investment grade credit rating and require us to maintain minimum liquidity of $1.0 billion. To the extent we fail to meet these requirements, \nwe will be required to post collateral, similar to the standard convention related to over-the-counter derivatives.

We believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We have not received a \nproposed assessment for the unresolved key transfer pricing issues. We do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months.

Nine of these cases were filed in 2002 and are consolidated for certain pre-trial \nproceedings; the remaining cases are stayed. In a separate 2009 decision, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that adverse health \neffect claims arising from the use of cellular handsets that operate within the U.S. Federal Communications Commission radio frequency emission \nguidelines (“FCC Guidelines”) are pre-empted by federal law. The plaintiffs allege that their handsets either operated outside the FCC Guidelines or were \nmanufactured before the FCC Guidelines went into effect.

In 2014, the trial court granted in part and denied in part the defendants’ motion to exclude the plaintiffs’ general causation experts. The \ndefendants filed an interlocutory appeal to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals challenging the standard for evaluating expert scientific evidence. In \nOctober 2016, the Court of Appeals issued its decision adopting the standard advocated by the defendants and remanding the cases to the trial court for \nfurther proceedings under that standard. The plaintiffs have filed supplemental expert evidence, portions of which were stricken by the court.  A hearing \non general causation took place in September of 2022. In April of 2023, the court granted defendants’ motion to strike the testimony of plaintiffs’ experts \nthat cell phones cause brain cancer and entered an order excluding all of plaintiffs’ experts from testifying.\nIrish Data Protection Commission Matter\nIn 2018, the Irish Data Protection Commission (“IDPC”) began investigating a complaint against LinkedIn as to whether LinkedIn’s targeted advertising \npractices violated the recently implemented European Union General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). Microsoft cooperated throughout the period \nof inquiry. In April 2023, the IDPC provided LinkedIn with a non-public preliminary draft decision alleging GDPR violations and proposing a fine. Microsoft \nintends to challenge the preliminary draft decision. There is no set timeline for the IDPC to issue a final decision.\nOther Contingencies \nWe also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Although management \ncurrently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial \nstatements, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future. \nAs of June 30, 2023, we accrued aggregate legal liabilities of $617 million. While we intend to defend these matters vigorously, adverse outcomes that \nwe estimate could reach approximately $600 million in aggregate beyond recorded amounts are reasonably possible. Were unfavorable final outcomes to \noccur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements for the period in which the effects become \nreasonably estimable. \n88\n\n\nPART II\nItem 8\n \nNOTE 16 — STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY \nShares Outstanding \nShares of common stock outstanding were as follows: \n \n(In millions)\n  \n   \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nYear Ended June 30,\n \n2023\n2022\n2021  \n \n \n \n \nBalance, beginning of year\n  \n7,464\n7,519\n7,571\nIssued\n  \n37\n40\n49 \nRepurchased\n  \n(69)\n(95)\n(101 )\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBalance, end of year\n  \n7,432 \n7,464\n7,519 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nShare Repurchases\nOn September 18, ",

Operating expenses that are \nallocated primarily include those relating to marketing of products and services from which multiple segments benefit and are generally allocated based \non relative gross margin.\nIn addition, certain costs are incurred at a corporate level and allocated to our segments. These allocated costs  generally include legal, including \nsettlements and fines, information technology, human resources, finance, excise taxes, field selling, shared facilities services, customer service and \nsupport, and severance incurred as part of a corporate program.

The Company offers customers the ability to acquire \nmultiple licenses of software products and services, including cloud-based services, in its customer agreements through its volume licensing \nprograms.\n96\n\n\nPART II\nItem 8\n \nSignificant judgment is exercised by the Company in determining revenue recognition for these customer agreements, and includes the following:\n•Determination of whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus \ntogether, such as software licenses and related services that are sold with cloud-based services.\n•The pattern of delivery (i.e., timing of when revenue is recognized) for each distinct performance obligation.\n•Identification and treatment of contract terms that may impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized (e.g., variable consideration, optional \npurchases, and free services). \n•Determination of stand-alone selling prices for each distinct performance obligation and for products and services that are not sold separately.\nGiven these factors and due to the volume of transactions, the related audit effort in evaluating management's judgments in determining revenue \nrecognition for these customer agreements was extensive and required a high degree of auditor judgment.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur principal audit procedures related to the Company's revenue recognition for these customer agreements included the following:\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of controls related to the identification of distinct performance obligations, the determination of the timing of \nrevenue recognition, and the estimation of variable consideration.\n \n \n•\nWe evaluated management's significant accounting policies related to these customer agreements for reasonableness.\n \n \n•\nWe selected a sample of customer agreements and performed",

The Company remains under IRS audit, or subject to IRS audit, for tax years subsequent to 2003. While the \nCompany has settled a portion of the IRS audits, resolution of the remaining matters could have a material impact on the Company's financial \nstatements. \nConclusions on recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions involve significant estimates and management judgment and include complex \nconsiderations of the Internal Revenue Code, related regulations, tax case laws, and prior-year audit settlements. Given the complexity and the \nsubjective nature of the transfer pricing issues that remain unresolved with the IRS, evaluating management's estimates relating to their \ndetermination of uncertain tax positions required extensive audit effort and a high degree of auditor judgment, including involvement of our tax \nspecialists.\n97\n\n\nPART II\nItem 8\n \nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur principal audit procedures to evaluate management's estimates of uncertain tax positions related to unresolved transfer pricing issues \nincluded the following:\n•We evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of management's methods and assumptions used in the identification, recognition, \nmeasurement, and disclosure of uncertain tax positions, which included testing the effectiveness of the related internal controls.\n•We read and evaluated management's documentation, including relevant accounting policies and information obtained by management from \noutside tax specialists, that detailed the basis of the uncertain tax positions.\n•We tested the reasonableness of management's judgments regarding the future resolution of the uncertain tax positions, including an evaluation \nof the technical merits of the uncertain tax positions.\n•For those uncertain tax positions that had not been effectively settled, we evaluated whether management had",

Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures \nare effective. \nREPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING \nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. Internal control over \nfinancial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance \nwith accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in \nreasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for \npreparation of our consolidated financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of company assets are made in \naccordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of company assets \nthat could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent \nlimitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our consolidated financial \nstatements would be prevented or detected. \nManagement conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control – \nIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, \nmanagement concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of June 30, 2023.

      "output": "From the collected outputs, we have identified several key pieces of information related to Microsoft's total debt or total liabilities for FY2023 and FY2022:\n\n1. **Chunk 73** provides the most relevant data:\n   - Total current liabilities for 2023: \\$104,149 million\n   - Total liabilities for 2023: \\$205,753 million\n   - Total current liabilities for 2022: \\$95,082 million\n   - Total liabilities for 2022: \\$198,298 million\n   - Therefore, the total debt or total liabilities are:\n     - 2023: \\$309,902 million\n     - 2022: \\$293,380 million\n\n2. **Chunk 65** also provides a breakdown of liabilities, but it seems to be a different categorization (contractual obligations) and does not directly align with the total liabilities figures.\n\n3. **Chunk 96** mentions a total debt figure of \\$52,866 million, but this seems to be a component of the total liabilities rather than the entire amount.\n\n4. **Chunk 73** provides a clear comparison of total liabilities between FY2023 and FY2022, which is directly relevant to the question.\n\nBased on the information from Chunk 73, we can conclude that Microsoft's total liabilities increased from \\$293,380 million in FY2022 to \\$309,902 million in FY2023. This indicates that Microsoft has indeed increased its debt on the balance sheet between these two fiscal years.\n\nThe information provided is sufficient to answer the question, as we have a direct comparison of total liabilities for the two fiscal years. There are no conflicting answers regarding the total liabilities figures, and the citation from Chunk 73 supports the conclusion."
