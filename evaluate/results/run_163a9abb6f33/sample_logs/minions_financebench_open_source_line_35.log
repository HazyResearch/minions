--- Question ---
What drove operating margin change as of the FY22 for AMD? If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then please state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
The operating margin for AMD decreased from $3,648 million in FY21 to $1,264 million in FY22. This decline was driven by increased costs of goods sold due to amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, higher operating expenses from R&D and marketing, and one-time charges related to acquisitions. Revenue growth in the Data Center and Gaming segments was offset by a decline in the Client segment, influenced by weak PC market conditions. Competitive pressures and macroeconomic factors also contributed to the margin decrease.

--- Ground Truth ---
["The decrease in AMD's operating income was primarily driven by amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition"]
