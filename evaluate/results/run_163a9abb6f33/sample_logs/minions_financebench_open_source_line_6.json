    "No. The quick ratio for 3M was 0.96 by Jun'23 close, which needs a bit of an improvement to touch the 1x mark"

  "correctness_reasoning": "The predicted answer states a quick ratio of 0.85, which is outside the 10% tolerance range of the ground truth quick ratio of 0.96 (acceptable range: 0.864 to 1.056). Additionally, both answers agree on the conclusion that 3M's liquidity position is less than ideal, but the numerical discrepancy affects the correctness based on the evaluation rules."
