Total length: 293276 characters to answer this question. \n\nAlso consider the following constraints:\n- In your response do NOT use numbered lists.\n- Do NOT structure your response as a sequence of steps.\n",
      "output": "To determine Amazon's FY2017 days payable outstanding (DPO), focus on extracting specific financial data from the balance sheet and the profit and loss (P&L) statement. You need the accounts payable figures for both FY2016 and FY2017 to calculate the average accounts payable. Additionally, obtain the cost of goods sold (COGS) for FY2017 from the P&L statement. The change in inventory requires the inventory figures for both FY2016 and FY2017, which are also found on the balance sheet. With these figures, you can compute the DPO using the formula provided. Ensure all values are accurately extracted and calculations are precise, rounding the final DPO to two decimal places."

Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 12 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`.

We seek to be Earth’s most customer-centric company. We are guided by four\nprinciples: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. In each of our\nsegments, we serve our primary customer sets, consisting of consumers, sellers, developers, enterprises, and content creators. In addition, we provide services, such\nas advertising services and co-branded credit card agreements.\nWe have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and Amazon Web Services (“AWS”).

We strive to offer our customers the lowest prices possible through low everyday product\npricing and shipping offers, and to improve our operating efficiencies so that we can continue to lower prices for our customers. We also provide easy-to-use\nfunctionality, fast and reliable fulfillment, and timely customer service.

Local companies may have a substantial competitive\nadvantage because of their greater understanding of, and focus on, the local customer, as well as their more established local brand names. We may not be able to\nhire, train, retain, and manage required personnel, which may limit our international growth.\nThe People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) and India regulate Amazon’s and its affiliates’ businesses and operations in country through regulations and license\nrequirements that may restrict (i) foreign investment in and operation of the Internet, IT infrastructure, data centers, retail, delivery, and other sectors, (ii) Internet\ncontent, and (iii) the sale of media and other products and services. For example, in order to meet local ownership and regulatory licensing requirements,\nwww.amazon.cn is operated by PRC companies that are indirectly owned, either wholly or partially, by PRC nationals. In addition, we provide certain technology\nservices in China in conjunction with third parties that hold PRC licenses to provide services. In India, the government restricts the ownership or control of Indian\ncompanies by foreign entities involved in online multi-brand retail trading activities. For www.amazon.in, we provide certain marketing tools and logistics services\nto third-party sellers to enable them to sell online and deliver to customers, and we hold indirect minority interests in entities that are third-party sellers on the\nwww.amazon.in marketplace. Although we believe these structures and activities comply with existing laws, they involve unique risks, and the PRC is actively\nconsidering changes in its foreign investment rules that could impact these structures and activities. There are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation\nof PRC and Indian laws and regulations, and it is possible that these governments will ultimately take a view contrary to ours. In addition, our Chinese and Indian\nbusinesses and operations may be unable to continue to operate if we or our affiliates are unable to access sufficient funding or in China enforce contractual\nrelationships with respect to management and control of such businesses. If our international activities were found to be in violation of any existing or future PRC,\nIndian or other laws or regulations or if interpretations of those laws and regulations were to change, our businesses in those countries could be subject to fines and\nother financial penalties, have licenses revoked, or be forced to shut down entirely.\nIf We Do Not Successful",

On March 23, 2017, the U.S. Tax Court issued its decision\nregarding the issues raised in the IRS NOPAs. The Tax Court rejected the approach from the IRS NOPAs in determining transfer pricing adjustments in 2005 and\n2006 for the transactions undertaken with our foreign subsidiaries and adopted, with adjustments, our suggested approach. On September 29, 2017, the IRS filed a\nnotice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. We will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. If the Tax Court decision were\nreversed on appeal or if the IRS were to successfully assert transfer pricing adjustments of a similar nature to the NOPAs for transactions in subsequent years, we\ncould be subject to significant additional tax liabilities. In addition, in October 2014, the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether\ndecisions by the tax authorities in Luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on\nstate aid. On October 4, 2017, the European Commission announced its decision that determinations by the tax authorities in Luxembourg did not comply with\nEuropean Union rules on state aid.

The following is a reconciliation of free cash\nflow to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” for 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 (in millions):\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2015\n2016\n2017\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n$\n12,039\n$\n17,272\n$\n18,434\nPurchases of property and equipment, including internal-use software and website development, net\nof proceeds from property and equipment incentives\n(4,589)\n(6,737)\n(10,058)\nFree cash flow\n$\n7,450\n$\n10,535\n$\n8,376\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n$\n(6,450)\n$\n(9,876)\n$\n(27,819)\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n$\n(",

Our long-term debt is carried at\namortized cost and fluctuations in interest rates do not impact our consolidated financial statements. However, the fair value of our debt, which pays interest at a\nfixed rate, will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates\nof interest.

These capitalized costs are amortized to “Cost of sales” on an accelerated basis that follows the viewing pattern of customer streams in the\nfirst months after availability.\nInvestments\nWe generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities and AAA-rated money market funds. Such\ninvestments are included in “Cash and cash equivalents” or “Marketable securities” on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Marketable securities are\nclassified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss.”\nEquity investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting if the investment gives us the ability to exercise significant influence, but not\ncontrol, over an investee. Equity-method investments are included within “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets. Our share of the earnings or losses as\nreported by equity-method investees, amortization of basis differences, and related gains or losses, if any, are classified as “Equity - method investment activity,\nnet of tax” on our consolidated statements of operations.\nEquity investments without readily determinable fair values and for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for using\nthe cost method of accounting and classified as “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets. Under the cost method, investments are carried at cost and are\nadjusted only for other-than-temporary declines in fair value, certain distributions, and additional investments.\nEquity investments that have readily determinable fair values are classified as available-for-sale and are included in “Marketable securities” on our\nconsolidated balance sheets and are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, included in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss.”\nWe periodically evaluate whether declines in fair values of our investments below their book value are other-than-temporary. This evaluation consists of\nseveral qualitative and quantitative factors regarding the severity and duration of the unrealized loss as well as our ability and intent to hold the investment until a\nforecasted recovery occurs. Additionally, we assess whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell any\ninvestment before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Factors considered include quoted market prices; recent financial results and operating trends; implied\nvalues from any recent transactions or offers of investee securities; credit quality of debt instrument issuers; other publicly available information that may affect the\nvalue",

On September 29, 2017, the IRS filed a notice of\nappeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. We will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. If the Tax Court decision were reversed\non appeal or if the IRS were to successfully assert transfer pricing adjustments of a similar nature to the NOPAs for transactions in subsequent years, we could be\nsubject to significant additional tax liabilities.\nCertain of our subsidiaries were under examination or investigation by the French Tax Administration (“FTA”) for calendar year 2006 and thereafter. In\nSeptember 2012, we received proposed tax assessment notices for calendar years 2006 through 2010 relating to the allocation of income between foreign\njurisdictions. In June 2015, we rec",

In addition, in October 2014, the\nEuropean Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in Luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax\npaid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid.

On March 23, 2017, the U.S. Tax Court issued its decision regarding the issues raised in the\nIRS NOPAs. The Tax Court rejected the approach from the IRS NOPAs in determining transfer pricing adjustments in 2005 and 2006 for the transactions\nundertaken with our foreign subsidiaries a",

In addition, in October 2014, the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax\nauthorities in Luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid. On October\n4, 2017, the European Commission announced its decision that determinations by the tax authorities in Luxembourg did not comply with European Union rules on\nstate aid.

These risks\nand uncertainties, as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ significantly from management’s expectations, are described\nin greater detail in Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.”\nOverview\nOur primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers . The products offered through our consumer-facing\nwebsites and physical stores primarily include merchandise and content we have purchased for resale from vendors and products offered by third-party sellers, and\nwe also manufacture and sell electronic devices. Generally, we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory as product sales and recognize our\nnet share of revenue of items sold by third-party sellers as service sales. We seek to increase unit sales across our businesses, through increased product selection,\nacross numerous product categories. We also offer other services such as compute, storage, and database offerings, fulfillment, publishing, certain digital content\nsubscriptions, advertising, and co-branded credit cards.\nOur financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flows 1 . Free cash flows are driven primarily by increasing operating income and\nefficiently managing working capital 2 and cash capital expenditures, including our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment. Increases in operating\nincome primarily result from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs, partially offset by investments we make in\nlonger-term strategic initiatives. To increase sales of products and services, we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience, including lowering\nprices, improving availability, offering faster delivery and performance times, increasing selection, increasing product categories and service offerings, expanding\nproduct information, improving ease of use, improving reliability, and earning customer trust.\nWe seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs.

Our effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, such as intercompany transactions, the relative\namount of our foreign earnings, including earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in\njurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, the applicability of special tax regimes, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the\nrelated tax benefit, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, entry into new businesses and geographies, changes to our existing businesses and operations,\nacquisitions (including integrations) and investments and how they are financed, changes in our stock price, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and\ntheir valuation, and changes in the relevant tax, accounting, and other laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations. In addition, a\nnumber of countries are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, such as the recently enacted U.S. tax reform legislation\ncommonly referred to as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “2017 Tax Act”). Finally, foreign governments may enact tax laws in response to the 2017\nTax Act that could result in further changes to global taxation and materially affect our financial position and results of operations.\nThe 2017 Tax Act significantly changes how the U.S. taxes corporations. The 2017 Tax Act requires complex computations to be performed that were not\npreviously required in U.S. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the 2017 Tax Act and significant estimates in\ncalculations, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. The U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other\nstandard-setting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the 2017 Tax Act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our\ninterpretation.

Net sales and related expenses generated from our\ninternationally-focused websites, and from www.amazon.ca and www.amazon.com.mx (which are included in our North America segment), are primarily\ndenominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding websites and primarily include Euros, Japanese Yen, and British Pounds. The results of operations\nof, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our internationally-focused websites and AWS are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations.\nUpon consolidation, as foreign exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant\ngains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. For example, as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates throughout the period compared\nto rates in effect the prior year, International segment net sales increased by $137 million in comparison with the prior year.\nWe have foreign exchange risk related to foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (“foreign funds”). Based on the balance of\nforeign funds as of December 31, 2017 , of $11.1 billion , an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in fair value declines of\n$555 million, $1.1 billion, and $2.2 billion. All investments are classified as “available-for-sale.” Fluctuations in fair value are recorded in “Accumulated other\ncomprehensive loss,” a separate component of stockholders’ equity.\nWe have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in various foreign currencies. Based on the intercompany balances as of\nDecember 31, 2017 , an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in losses of $280 million, $600 million, and $1.3 billion,\nrecorded to “Other income (expense), net.”\nSee Item 7 of Part I",

Estimated selling prices are management’s best estimates of the prices that we would charge our customers if we were to sell the standalone elements\nseparately and include considerations of customer demand, prices charged by us and others for similar deliverables, and the price if largely based on the cost of\nproducing the product or service.\nSales of certain of our digital devices are considered arrangements with multiple deliverables, consisting of the device, undelivered software upgrades and/or\nundelivered non-software services such as cloud services.

We consider\nmany factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent cumulative loss experience and expectations of\nfuture earnings, capital gains and investment in such jurisdiction, the carry-forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors.\nWe utilize a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain income tax positions (tax contingencies).

Equipment includes assets such as furniture and fixtures, heavy equipment,\nservers and networking equipment, and internal-use software and website development. Depreciation is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful\nlives of the assets (generally the lesser of 40 years or the remaining life of the underlying building, two years for assets such as internal-use software, three years\nfor our servers, five years for networking equipment, five years for furniture and fixtures, and ten years for heavy equipment). Depreciation expense is classified\nwithin the corresponding operating expense categories on our consolidated statements of operations.\nLeases and Asset Retirement Obligations\nWe categorize leases at their inception as either operating or capital leases. On certain of our lease agreements, we may receive rent holidays and other\nincentives. We recognize lease costs on a straight-line basis without regard to deferred payment terms, such as rent holidays, that defer the commencement date of\nrequired payments. Additionally, incentives we receive are treated as a reduction of our costs over the term of the agreement. Leasehold improvements are\ncapitalized at cost and amortized over the lesser of their expected useful life or the non-cancellable term of the lease.\nWe establish assets and liabilities for the estimated construction costs incurred under build-to-suit lease arrangements to the extent we are involved in the\nconstruction of structural improvements or take construction risk prior to commencement of a lease.

As a result of this assessment,\nmanagement concluded that, as of December 31, 2017 , our internal control over financial reporting was effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nErnst & Young has independently assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and its report is included below.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2017 that materially affected, or are reasonably\nlikely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nLimitations on Controls\nOur disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their\nobjectives as specified above. Management does not expect, however, that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting\nwill prevent or detect all error and fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only\nreasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error\nor fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.\n73\n\n\nTable of Contents\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nThe Board of Directors and Shareholders\nAmazon.com, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Amazon.com, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 , based on criteria established in Internal Control—\nIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion,\nAmazon.com, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 , based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated\nbalance sheets of Amazon.com, Inc. as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income,\nstockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017 of Amazon.com, Inc. and our report dated February 1, 2018\nexpressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of\ninternal control over financial reporting in",
