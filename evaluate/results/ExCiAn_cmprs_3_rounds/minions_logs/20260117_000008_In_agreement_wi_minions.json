Total length: 346534 characters to answer this question. \n\nAlso consider the following constraints:\n- In your response do NOT use numbered lists.\n- Do NOT structure your response as a sequence of steps.\n",
      "output": "To answer the question about Best Buy's 3-year average net profit margin from FY2015 to FY2017, focus on extracting specific financial data from the income statement. Identify the net profit (or net income) and total revenue for each fiscal year within the specified period. The net profit margin is calculated by dividing the net profit by the total revenue and then multiplying by 100 to convert it to a percentage. Once you have the net profit margins for each year, calculate the average of these percentages to determine the 3-year average net profit margin. Ensure that all calculations are rounded to one decimal place as required."

      "prompt": "# Decomposition Round #1\n\nYou (the supervisor) cannot directly read the document(s). Instead, you can assign small, isolated tasks to a less capable worker model that sees only a single chunk of text at a time. Any cross-chunk or multi-document reasoning must be handled by you.\n\n## Your Job: Write Two Python Functions\n\n### FUNCTION #1: `prepare_jobs(context, prev_job_manifests, prev_job_outputs) -> List[JobManifest]`\n- Break the document(s) into chunks (using the provided chunking function, if needed). Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 12 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`. All **multi-chunk integration** or **global reasoning** is your responsibility here.\n- Return one **aggregated string** suitable for further supervisor inspection.\n\n\n\n## Relevant Pydantic Models\n\nThe following models are already in the global scope. **Do NOT redefine or re-import them.**\n\n### JobManifest Model\n```\nclass JobManifest(BaseModel):\n    chunk: str  # the actual text for the chunk of the document\n    task: str  # the actual task instruction for the small model\n    advice: str  # optional, any additional advice on how to perform the task\n\n    chunk_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    task_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    job_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n\n```\n\n### JobOutput Model\n```\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    citation: Optional[str]\n    answer: Optional[str]\n\n```\n\n## Function Signatures\n```\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        context (List[str]): A list of documents.

Question to answer:\nIn agreement with the information outlined in the income statement, what is the FY2015 - FY2017 3 year average net profit margin (as a %) for Best Buy? Answer in units of percents and round to one decimal place.\n\n2. Collected Job Outputs (from junior models):\nNet Profit Data:\n  - Net Profit (Operating Income): $1,764 million\n  - Net Profit (Operating Income): $1,585 million\n  - Net Profit (Operating Income): $1,437\n**Net Profit:**\n\nTotal Revenue Data:\n  - Total Revenue: $36,248 million\n  - Total Revenue: $36,365 million\n  - Total Revenue: $36,055 million\n   - Total Revenue: $39,403 million\n   - Total Revenue: $39,528 million\n\n## Instructions\nThink step-by-step about:\n1.

If sufficient, how we would calculate or derive the answer\n5.

      "output": "We have gathered information on net profit and total revenue for Best Buy, but there are some inconsistencies and missing data points:\n\n1. **Net Profit Data**: We have three net profit figures: $1,764 million, $1,585 million, and $1,437 million. However, it's unclear which fiscal year each figure corresponds to (FY2015, FY2016, or FY2017).\n\n2. **Total Revenue Data**: We have five total revenue figures: $36,248 million, $36,365 million, $36,055 million, $39,403 million, and $39,528 million. Similar to the net profit data, we need to know which fiscal year each figure corresponds to.\n\n3. **Sufficiency**: The information is not sufficient to calculate the 3-year average net profit margin because we need to match each net profit figure with its corresponding total revenue for each fiscal year. Additionally, we have more total revenue figures than net profit figures, which suggests some data might be extraneous or misaligned.\n\n4. **Missing Information**: We need to clearly identify which net profit and total revenue figures correspond to FY2015, FY2016, and FY2017. This will allow us to calculate the net profit margin for each year and then compute the 3-year average.\n\n5. **Calculation**: Once we have the correct pairings, the net profit margin for each year can be calculated using the formula: \\((\\text{Net Profit} / \\text{Total Revenue}) \\times 100\\). The 3-year average would then be the average of these annual net profit margins.\n\nIn summary, we need to resolve the ambiguity in the data by aligning each net profit and total revenue figure with the correct fiscal year. This will enable us to accurately calculate the 3-year average net profit margin."
