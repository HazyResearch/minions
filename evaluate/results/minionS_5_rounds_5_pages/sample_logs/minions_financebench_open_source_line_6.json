  "correctness_reasoning": "The predicted answer states that 3M has a quick ratio of 1.18, which is outside the 10% tolerance range of the ground truth quick ratio of 0.96 (acceptable range: 0.864 to 1.056). Additionally, the predicted answer concludes that 3M has a reasonably healthy liquidity profile, which contradicts the ground truth conclusion that it needs improvement. Therefore, the predicted answer is incorrect."
