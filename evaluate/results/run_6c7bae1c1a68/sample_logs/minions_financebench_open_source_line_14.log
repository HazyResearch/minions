--- Question ---
Does Adobe have an improving operating margin profile as of FY2022? If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
Adobe's operating margin for FY2022 is approximately 34.6%. However, due to inconsistent and unreliable data for previous years, it is not possible to conclusively determine if Adobe has an improving operating margin profile. Further investigation is needed to gather missing historical data for a more accurate analysis.

--- Ground Truth ---
['No the operating margins of Adobe have recently declined from 36.8% in FY 2021 to 34.6% in FY2022. A drop by 2.2% in a year.']
