Total length: 346534 characters to answer this question. \n\nAlso consider the following constraints:\n- In your response do NOT use numbered lists.\n- Do NOT structure your response as a sequence of steps.\n",
      "output": "To answer the question about Best Buy's 3-year average net profit margin from FY2015 to FY2017, focus on extracting specific financial data from the income statement. Key information includes the net profit (or net income) and total revenue for each fiscal year within the specified period. The net profit margin is calculated by dividing the net profit by total revenue and then multiplying by 100 to convert it to a percentage. Once you have the net profit margins for each year, calculate the average of these percentages over the three years. Ensure that all figures are accurate and consistent with the fiscal years in question, and round the final average to one decimal place as required."

      "prompt": "# Decomposition Round #1\n\nYou (the supervisor) cannot directly read the document(s). Instead, you can assign small, isolated tasks to a less capable worker model that sees only a single chunk of text at a time. Any cross-chunk or multi-document reasoning must be handled by you.\n\n## Your Job: Write Two Python Functions\n\n### FUNCTION #1: `prepare_jobs(context, prev_job_manifests, prev_job_outputs) -> List[JobManifest]`\n- Break the document(s) into chunks (using the provided chunking function, if needed). Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 12 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`. All **multi-chunk integration** or **global reasoning** is your responsibility here.\n- Return one **aggregated string** suitable for further supervisor inspection.\n\n\n\n## Relevant Pydantic Models\n\nThe following models are already in the global scope. **Do NOT redefine or re-import them.**\n\n### JobManifest Model\n```\nclass JobManifest(BaseModel):\n    chunk: str  # the actual text for the chunk of the document\n    task: str  # the actual task instruction for the small model\n    advice: str  # optional, any additional advice on how to perform the task\n\n    chunk_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    task_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    job_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n\n```\n\n### JobOutput Model\n```\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    citation: Optional[str]\n    answer: Optional[str]\n\n```\n\n## Function Signatures\n```\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        context (List[str]): A list of documents.

However, they reported that the data was insufficient to perform the calculation.\n\n2. **Sufficiency of Information**: The information is not sufficient to answer the question. We need specific financial figures: net profit and total revenue for each of the fiscal years 2015, 2016, and 2017.\n\n3. **Missing Information**: We are missing the exact values of net profit and total revenue for each of the fiscal years in question. Without these figures, we cannot calculate the net profit margin for each year, nor can we compute the 3-year average.\n\n4. **Calculation Method**: If we had the necessary data, we would calculate the net profit margin for each year by dividing the net profit by total revenue and multiplying by 100 to get a percentage. The 3-year average would then be the mean of these annual percentages.\n\n5. **Conflicting Answers**: There are no conflicting answers since all outputs indicate insufficient data.\n\nTo proceed, we need to ensure that the document chunks are thoroughly examined for the required financial figures or consider revisiting the document to ensure no relevant sections were overlooked."

Some chunks mention net earnings from continuing operations, while others mention net earnings including noncontrolling interests.\n   - **Total Revenue**: The total revenue figures for FY2015, FY2016, and FY2017 were consistently reported as \\$40,339 million, \\$39,528 million, and \\$39,403 million, respectively, in several chunks.\n\n2. **Sufficiency of Information**:\n   - The information is not entirely sufficient due to inconsistencies in the net profit figures. However, the total revenue figures seem consistent and reliable.\n\n3. **Missing Information**:\n   - A consistent and reliable set of net profit figures for FY2015, FY2016, and FY2017 is missing. The discrepancies in the net profit figures need to be resolved to ensure accurate calculation of the net profit margin.\n\n4. **Calculation**:\n   - If we had consistent net profit figures, the net profit margin for each year would be calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left(\\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}}\\right) \\times 100\n     \\]\n   - The 3-year average net profit margin would then be the average of the annual net profit margins.\n\n5. **Conflicting Answers**:\n   - For net profit, there are conflicting figures. The most reliable figures should be selected based on the most frequently cited and consistent sources. However, without clear citations or a dominant consensus, it is challenging to determine the correct net profit figures.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTo proceed, we need to resolve the inconsistencies in the net profit figures. Once we have reliable net profit data, we can calculate the net profit margin for each year and then determine the 3-year average. The total revenue figures appear consistent and can be used in the calculation once the net profit figures are clarified."
