Total length: 487605 characters.: \n\n## Question\nHas AMCOR's quick ratio improved or declined between FY2023 and FY2022? If the quick ratio is not something that a financial analyst would ask about a company like this, then state that and explain why.\n\n---\n\nPlease provide succinct advice on the critical information we need to extract from the Financial document. Total length: 487605 characters to answer this question. \n\nAlso consider the following constraints:\n- In your response do NOT use numbered lists.\n- Do NOT structure your response as a sequence of steps.\n",
      "output": "To determine whether AMCOR's quick ratio has improved or declined between FY2023 and FY2022, you need to extract specific financial data from the document. Focus on the balance sheets for both fiscal years to find the necessary components of the quick ratio, which include current assets, inventories, and current liabilities. The quick ratio is calculated by subtracting inventories from current assets and then dividing by current liabilities. Compare the quick ratios for FY2023 and FY2022 to assess any improvement or decline.\n\nIf the quick ratio is not typically analyzed for a company like AMCOR, it may be due to the nature of its industry or business model, where other financial metrics are more relevant. For instance, companies with significant inventory turnover or those in capital-intensive industries might focus more on metrics like inventory turnover ratio or debt-to-equity ratio. In such cases, understanding the industry context and typical financial analysis practices is crucial."

      "prompt": "# Decomposition Round #1\n\nYou (the supervisor) cannot directly read the document(s). Instead, you can assign small, isolated tasks to a less capable worker model that sees only a single chunk of text at a time. Any cross-chunk or multi-document reasoning must be handled by you.\n\n## Your Job: Write Two Python Functions\n\n### FUNCTION #1: `prepare_jobs(context, prev_job_manifests, prev_job_outputs) -> List[JobManifest]`\n- Break the document(s) into chunks (using the provided chunking function, if needed). Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 12 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`. All **multi-chunk integration** or **global reasoning** is your responsibility here.\n- Return one **aggregated string** suitable for further supervisor inspection.\n\n\n\n## Relevant Pydantic Models\n\nThe following models are already in the global scope. **Do NOT redefine or re-import them.**\n\n### JobManifest Model\n```\nclass JobManifest(BaseModel):\n    chunk: str  # the actual text for the chunk of the document\n    task: str  # the actual task instruction for the small model\n    advice: str  # optional, any additional advice on how to perform the task\n\n    chunk_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    task_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    job_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n\n```\n\n### JobOutput Model\n```\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    citation: Optional[str]\n    answer: Optional[str]\n\n```\n\n## Function Signatures\n```\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        context (List[str]): A list of documents.

Patents, patent applications, and license agreements will expire or terminate over time\nby operation of law, in accordance with their terms, or otherwise.\nSustainability and Innovation\n    Sustainability is comprehensively embedded across our business, from the investments we are making in packaging innovation and design, to\nour global collaboration strategy, to the work we undertake within our own operations and with our upstream and downstream partners to develop\na more responsible packaging value chain.    \n    We believe there will always be a role for the primary packaging we produce to preserve food, beverages, and healthcare products, protect\nconsumers, and promote brands. Consumers also want cost effective, convenient, and easy to use packaging with a reduced environmental\nfootprint and a responsible end of life solution. We have identified a clear path to provide food, beverages, and healthcare products to people\naround the world in a more sustainable way and meet our sustainability ambitions and those of our customers, by focusing on three key elements\nof responsible packaging: product innovation, consumer participation, and waste management infrastructure. We believe our commitment to\nresponsible packaging is integral to our success. Our responsible packaging solutions address both how the product is made, as well as what\nhappens after the consumer uses it, offering a wide variety of options to advance sustainability while meeting our customers’ specific packaging\nneeds.\n    Innovation is central to Amcor’s approach to sustainability and we spend approximately $100 million a year on research and development\n(\"R&D\"), not including ongoing investment in incremental continuous improvements. We are highly regarded for our innovation capabilities and\nhave more than 1,000 active patents, as well as a global network of Innovation Centers focused on bringing advanced packaging technologies and\nmore sustainable material science to our markets around the world. We solve packaging challenges, developing differentiated products, services,\nand processes to protect our customers' products and fulfil the needs of the consumers who rely on them.

A significant portion of our\ninsurance is placed in the insurance market with third-party reinsurers. Our policies with such third-party reinsurers cover a variety of risk\nexposures, including property damage and business interruption. Although we believe the coverage provided by such policies is consistent with\nindustry practice, the insurance coverage does not insure us against all risks in our operations or all claims we may receive and there is no\nguarantee that any claims made under such policies will ultimately be paid or that we will be able to maintain such insurance at acceptable\npremium cost levels in the future.\n    Additionally, we retain a portion of our insurable risk through a captive insurance company, Amcor Insurances Pte Ltd, which is located in\nSingapore. Our captive insurance company collects annual premiums from our business groups and assumes specific risks relating to various risk\nexposures, including property damage. The captive insurance company may be required to make payments for insurance claims that exceed the\ncaptive's reserves, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nLegal and Compliance Risks\nIntellectual Property — Our inability to defend our intellectual property rights or intellectual property infringement claims against us could\nhave an adverse impact on our ability to compete effectively.\n    Our ability to compete effectively depends, in part, on our ability to protect and maintain the proprietary nature of our owned and licensed\nintellectual property. We own a number of patents on our products, aspects of our products, methods of use and/or methods of manufacturing, and\nwe own, or have licenses to use, the material trademark and trade name rights used in connection with the packaging, marketing and distribution\nof our major products. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, and other unpatented proprietary technology. If we are unable to detect the\ninfringement of our intellectual property or to enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitive position may suffer. The unauthorized use\nof our intellectual property by someone else could reduce certain of our competitive advantages, cause us to lose sales, or otherwise harm our\nbusiness.\n    We attempt to protect and restrict access to our intellectual property and proprietary information by relying on the patent, trademark, copyright,\nand trade secret laws of the countries in which we operate, as well as non-disclosure agreements. However, it may be possible for a third-party to\nobtain our information without authorization, independently develop similar technologies, or breach a non-disclosure agreement entered into with\nus.

Lockdowns and related impacts, including the unwinding of lockdowns, impacted demand for our products in China in fiscal\nyear 2023. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, our facilities were largely exempt from government mandated closure orders.

In fiscal years 2023 and\n2022, we recorded total expenses of $55 million before insurance settlements, primarily related to inventory, property, and equipment losses from\nthe fire and other expenses related to the fire and closure of our South African business.

Accordingly, the Company records provisions for severance when payments are probable and estimable and\nwhen the Company has committed to the restructuring plan. In the absence of a standard customary practice or established local practice,\nliabilities for severance are recognized when incurred. If fixed assets become impaired as a result of the Company’s restructuring efforts, these\nassets are written down to their fair value less costs to sell, as the Company commits to dispose of them, and they are no longer in use.\nDepreciation is accelerated on fixed assets for the period of time the asset continues to be used until the asset ceases to be used.

This indicates that AMCOR's quick ratio has declined from FY2022 to FY2023.\n\nThe information we have is sufficient to answer the question. There are no conflicting answers, and the calculations are straightforward based on the data provided. The decline in the quick ratio suggests a decrease in liquidity, meaning AMCOR has less ability to cover its short-term liabilities with its most liquid assets in FY2023 compared to FY2022."
