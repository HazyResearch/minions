  "correctness_reasoning": "The predicted answer correctly identifies the decrease in 3M's operating margin in FY2022 and attributes it to increased costs and specific charges related to litigation and restructuring. These points align with the ground truth answer, which mentions litigation, restructuring, and other charges as reasons for the margin decrease. The numerical value of the operating margin decrease is within the acceptable tolerance range."
