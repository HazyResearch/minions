  "question": "Roughly how many times has AES Corporation sold its inventory in FY2022? Calculate inventory turnover ratio for the FY2022; if conventional inventory management is not meaningful for the company then state that and explain why.",
  "predicted_answer": "The inventory turnover ratio for AES Corporation in FY2022 cannot be calculated due to the absence of average inventory data. The COGS is $10,069 million, but the average inventory is not available. AES Corporation may not use conventional inventory management due to its business model.",
  "ground_truth": [
    "AES has converted inventory 9.5 times in FY 2022."
