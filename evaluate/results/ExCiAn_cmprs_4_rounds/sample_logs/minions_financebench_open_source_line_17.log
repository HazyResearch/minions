--- Question ---
Roughly how many times has AES Corporation sold its inventory in FY2022? Calculate inventory turnover ratio for the FY2022; if conventional inventory management is not meaningful for the company then state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
Due to conflicting data on COGS and average inventory, it is not possible to accurately calculate the inventory turnover ratio for AES Corporation in FY2022. Furthermore, the presence of material weaknesses in inventory management and valuation methods indicates that conventional inventory management may not be fully applicable to the company.

--- Ground Truth ---
['AES has converted inventory 9.5 times in FY 2022.']
