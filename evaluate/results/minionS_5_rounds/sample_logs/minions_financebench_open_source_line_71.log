--- Question ---
Based on the information provided primarily in the balance sheet and the statement of income, what is FY2020 days payable outstanding (DPO) for Corning? DPO is defined as: 365 * (average accounts payable between FY2019 and FY2020) / (FY2020 COGS + change in inventory between FY2019 and FY2020). Round your answer to two decimal places.

--- Predicted Answer ---
DPO = (365 * 1,099) / (7,772 + 118) = 50.88

--- Ground Truth ---
['63.86']

--- Correctness Evaluation ---
Is correct: False
Confidence: 0.90
Reasoning: The predicted answer of 50.88 is outside the 10% tolerance range of the ground truth answer, which is 63.86. The acceptable range is 57.47 to 70.25. Therefore, the predicted answer is incorrect.
