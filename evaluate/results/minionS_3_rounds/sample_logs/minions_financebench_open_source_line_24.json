  "question": "Has AMCOR's quick ratio improved or declined between FY2023 and FY2022? If the quick ratio is not something that a financial analyst would ask about a company like this, then state that and explain why.",
  "predicted_answer": "Due to the lack of specific financial data, it is not possible to determine whether AMCOR's quick ratio has improved or declined between FY2023 and FY2022. The document does not provide the necessary figures for current assets, inventories, and current liabilities for these fiscal years.",
  "ground_truth": [
    "The quick ratio has slightly improved from 0.67 times to 0.69 times between FY 2023 and FY 2022.(3.4% jump)"

  "correctness_reasoning": "The predicted answer states that it is not possible to determine the change in AMCOR's quick ratio due to a lack of data, while the ground truth provides specific figures showing an improvement from 0.67 to 0.69. The predicted answer does not align with the ground truth, which clearly states the quick ratio has improved."
