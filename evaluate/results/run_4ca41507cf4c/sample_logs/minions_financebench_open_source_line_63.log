--- Question ---
Does Boeing have an improving gross margin profile as of FY2022? If gross margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
Boeing's gross margin profile for FY2022 cannot be reliably assessed due to the lack of explicit gross margin figures and the complexity of its business model. Gross margin is not a particularly useful metric for Boeing, given its involvement in long-term contracts and the impact of industry-specific factors such as regulatory changes, supply chain disruptions, and production challenges. Instead, operating margin and other financial metrics should be considered for a more accurate assessment of Boeing's financial health.

--- Ground Truth ---
['Yes. Boeing has an improving gross margin profile as of FY2022. Gross profit improved from $3,017 million in FY2021 to $3,502 million in FY2022. Gross margin % improved from 4.8% in FY2021 to 5.3% in FY2022.']
