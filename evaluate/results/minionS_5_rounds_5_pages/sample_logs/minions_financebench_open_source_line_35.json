  "predicted_answer": "AMD's operating margin decreased in FY22 due to increased costs from acquisitions, higher R&D and marketing expenses, and competitive pressures, which offset the revenue growth.",
  "ground_truth": [
    "The decrease in AMD's operating income was primarily driven by amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition"

  "correctness_reasoning": "The predicted answer mentions increased costs from acquisitions, higher R&D and marketing expenses, and competitive pressures as reasons for the decrease in operating margin. However, the ground truth specifically highlights the amortization of intangible assets from the Xilinx acquisition as the primary driver. While the predicted answer touches on acquisitions, it does not specifically mention amortization of intangible assets, which is a key fact in the ground truth. Therefore, the key facts and conclusions do not align."
