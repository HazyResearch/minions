Please help us compute it by basing your answers off of the statement of income and the statement of cash flows. Here's the question: what is the FY2015 unadjusted EBITDA % margin for Netflix? Calculate unadjusted EBITDA using unadjusted operating income and D&A (from cash flow statement).\n\n---\n\nPlease provide succinct advice on the critical information we need to extract from the Financial document. Total length: 232930 characters to answer this question. \n\nAlso consider the following constraints:\n- In your response do NOT use numbered lists.\n- Do NOT structure your response as a sequence of steps.\n",
      "output": "To calculate the FY2015 unadjusted EBITDA % margin for Netflix, focus on extracting specific figures from the financial document. First, locate the statement of income to find the unadjusted operating income for FY2015. This figure represents the earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT). Next, turn to the statement of cash flows to identify the depreciation and amortization (D&A) expenses for the same fiscal year. The unadjusted EBITDA is calculated by adding the D&A expenses to the unadjusted operating income. To determine the EBITDA % margin, you will need the total revenue for FY2015, which is also found in the statement of income. The EBITDA % margin is then calculated by dividing the unadjusted EBITDA by the total revenue and multiplying by 100 to express it as a percentage. Ensure that all figures are consistent with the fiscal year 2015 to maintain accuracy."

Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 12 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`. All **multi-chunk integration** or **global reasoning** is your responsibility here.\n- Return one **aggregated string** suitable for further supervisor inspection.\n\n\n\n## Relevant Pydantic Models\n\nThe following models are already in the global scope. **Do NOT redefine or re-import them.**\n\n### JobManifest Model\n```\nclass JobManifest(BaseModel):\n    chunk: str  # the actual text for the chunk of the document\n    task: str  # the actual task instruction for the small model\n    advice: str  # optional, any additional advice on how to perform the task\n\n    chunk_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    task_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    job_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n\n```\n\n### JobOutput Model\n```\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    citation: Optional[str]\n    answer: Optional[str]\n\n```\n\n## Function Signatures\n```\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        context (List[str]): A list of documents.

(“Netflix”, “the Company”, “we”, or “us”) is the world’s leading Internet television network with over 75 million streaming members in over\n190 countries enjoying more than 125 million hours of TV shows and movies per day, including original series, documentaries and feature films. Our members can\nwatch as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, on nearly any Internet-connected screen. Members can play, pause and resume watching, all without commercials\nor commitments. Additionally, in the United States (\"U.S.\"), our members can receive DVDs delivered quickly to their homes.\nWe are a pioneer in the Internet delivery of TV shows and movies, launching our streaming service in 2007. Since this launch, we have developed an\necosystem for Internet-connected screens and have added increasing amounts of content that enable consumers to enjoy TV shows and movies directly on their\nInternet-connected screens. As a result of these efforts, we have experienced growing consumer acceptance of, and interest in, the delivery of TV shows and\nmovies directly over the Internet.\nOur core strategy is to grow our streaming membership business globally within the parameters of our consolidated net income and operating segment\ncontribution profit (loss) targets. We are continuously improving our members' experience by expanding our streaming content with a focus on a programming mix\nof content that delights our members. In addition, we are perpetually enhancing our user interface and extendin",

We began our international expansion with Canada in 2010 and have since\nlaunched our service globally, with the exception of The People's Republic of China and territories where U.S. companies are not allowed to operate. We have also\nexpanded our streaming content offering to include more exclusive and original programming, including several Emmy, Golden Globe and Academy Award\nnominated original series and documentaries. Our original programming increasingly includes content that we produce.\n \nBUSINESS SEGMENTS\nThe Company has three reportable segments: Domestic streaming, International streaming and Domestic DVD. The Domestic streaming segment derives\nrevenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of streaming content to our members in the United States. The International streaming\nsegment derives revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of streaming content to our members outside the United States. The\nDomestic DVD segment derives revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of DVD-by-mail. For additional information regarding our\nsegments, including information about our financial results by geography, see Note 12 of Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data .\n1\n\n\nTable of Contents\nCOMPETITION\nThe market for entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. We compete against other entertainment video providers, such as\nmultichannel video programming distributors (\"MVPDs\"), Internet-based movie and TV content providers (including those that provide pirated content), video\ngaming providers and DVD rental outlets and more broadly against other sources of entertainment that our members could choose in their moments of free time.\nWe also compete against entertainment video providers in obtaining content that our members love, both for licensed streaming content and for original content\nprojects.\nWhile consumers may maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple entertainment sources, we strive for consumers to choose us in their moments of\nfree time. We have often referred to this choice as our objective of \"winning moments of truth.\" In attempting to win these moments of truth with our members, we\nare continually improving our service, including both our technology and our content, which is increasingly exclusive and curated, and includes our own original\nprogramming.\nSEASONALITY\nOur membership growth exhibits a seasonal pattern that reflects variations when consumers buy Internet-connected screens and when they tend to increase\ntheir viewing. Historically, the first and fourth quarters (October through March)represent our greatest membership growth across our Domestic and International\nstreaming segments and the fewest membership losses in our Domestic DVD segment.

We use a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect our\nproprietary intellectual property.

Our ability to continue to attract members will depend in part on our ability\nto consistently provide our members with compelling content choices, as well as a quality experience for selecting and viewing TV shows and movies.\nFurthermore, the relative service levels, content offerings, pricing and related features of competitors to our service may adversely impact our ability to attract and\nretain memberships. Competitors include other entertainment video providers, such as MVPDs, Internet-based movie and TV content providers (including those\nthat provide pirated content) and DVD rental outlets. If consumers do not perceive our service offering to be of value, including if we introduce new or adjust\nexisting features, adjust pricing or service offerings, or change the mix of content in a manner that is not favorably received by them, we may not be able to attract\nand retain members. In addition, many of our members are rejoining our service or originate from word-of-mouth advertising from existing members. If our efforts\nto satisfy our existing members are not successful, we may not be able to attract members, and as a result, our ability to maintain and/or grow our business will be\nadversely affected. Members cancel our service for many reasons, including a perception that they do not use the service sufficiently, the need to cut household\nexpenses, availability of content is unsatisfactory, competitive services provide a better value or experience and customer service issues are not satisfactorily\nresolved. We must continually add new memberships both to replace canceled memberships and to grow our business beyond our current membership base. If\ngrowth rates slow faster than expected, given, in particular that our content costs are largely fixed in nature and contracted over several years, we may not be able\nto adjust our expenditures or increase our (per membership) revenues commensurate with the lowered growth rate such that our margins, liquidity and results of\noperation may be adversely impacted. If we are unable to successfully compete with current and new competitors in both retaining our existing memberships and\nattracting new memberships, our business will be adversely affected. Further, if excessive numbers of members cancel our service, we may be required to incur\nsignificantly higher marketing expenditures than we currently anticipate to replace these members with new members.\nChanges in competitive offerings for entertainment video, including the potential rapid adoption of piracy-based video offerings, could adversely impact\nour business.\nThe market for entertainment video is intense",

          "chunk": "ent video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. Through new and existing distribution channels, consumers have\nincreasing options to access entertainment video. The various economic models underlying these channels include subscription, transactional, ad-supported and\npiracy-based models. All of these have the potential to capture meaningful segments of the entertainment video market. Piracy, in particular, threatens to damage\nour business, as its fundamental proposition to consumers is so compelling and difficult to compete against: virtually all content for free. Furthermore, in light of\nthe compelling consumer proposition, piracy services are subject to rapid global growth. Traditional providers of entertainment video, including broadcasters and\ncable network operators, as well as Internet based e-commerce or entertainment video providers are increasing their Internet-based video offerings. Several of these\ncompetitors have long operating histories, large customer bases, strong brand recognition and significant financial, marketing and other resources. They may secure\nbetter terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to product development, technology, infrastructure, content acquisitions and\nmarketing. New entrants may enter the market or existing providers may adjust their services with unique offerings or approaches to providing entertainment\nvideo. Companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions. If we are unable to successfully or profitably\ncompete with current and new competitors, our business will be adversely affected, and we may not be able to increase or maintain market share, revenues or\nprofitability.\n \nThe long-term and fixed cost nature of our content commitments may limit our operating flexibility and could adversely affect our liquidity and results of\noperations.\nIn connection with obtaining streaming content, we typically enter into multi-year commitments with studios and other content providers, the payment terms\nof which are not tied to member usage or the size of our membership base (“fixed cost”) but which may be tied to such factors as titles licensed and/or theatrical\nexhibition receipts.

For the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015, the impact from membership growth was slightly offset by a decrease in average monthly revenue per paying streaming membership resulting\nfrom unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations impacting our International streaming segment. This was partially offset by increases resulting from price changes\nand plan mix. The decrease in operating income for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 is due primarily to\nincreased marketing and headcount costs to support our international expansion in addition to increased content expenses as we continue to acquire, license and\nproduce content, including more Netflix originals. Net income is further impacted by the increase in interest expense associated with our debt issuance in the first\nquarter of 2015 as well as to an increase in losses on foreign currency denominated transactions.\nWe offer three types of streaming membership plans. In the U.S. our basic plan is priced at $7.99 per month and includes access to standard definition quality\nstreaming on a single screen at a time. Our most popular streaming plan is priced at $9.99 per month and includes access to high definition quality streaming on\ntwo screens concurrently. Our premium plan is priced at $11.99 per month and includes access to high definition and ultra-high definition quality content on four\nscreens concurrently. Internationally, the membership plans are structured similarly to the U.S. and range in price from the U.S. dollar equivalent of approximately\n$5.00 to $18.00 per month.\nWe expect that from time to time the prices of our membership plans in each country may change. For instance, in the second half of 2015, we increased the\nprice of our two-screen high definition plan in the U.S. and several European countries. In May 2014, in the U.S., we increased the price of our high definition plan\nfrom $7.99 per month to $8.99 per month with existing memberships grandfathered for a two year period. In October 2015, in the U.S., we increased the price of\nthis same high definition plan from $8.99 per month to $9.99 per month with existing memberships grandfathered for a one year period. In 2016, the grandfathered\npricing period will expire for a substantial number of U.S. memberships and the members will have the option of electing the basic streaming plan at $7.99 or\ncontinuing on the high definition plan at the higher price of $9.99.\nThe following represents the key elements to our segment results of operations:\n•\nWe define contribu",

We believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash\ngenerated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities. Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure\nand should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, net income, operating income, cash flow (used in) provided by operating activities, or any other\nmeasure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP.\nIn assessing liquidity in relation to our results of operations, we compare free cash flow to net income, noting that the three major recurring differences are\nexcess content payments over expense, non-cash stock-based compensation expense and other working capital differences. The excess content payments over\nexpense is variable based on the payment terms of our content agreements and is expected to increase as we enter into more agreements with upfront cash\npayments, such as licensing and production of original content.

We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the\ncircumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n27\n\n\nTable of Contents\nStreaming Content\nWe acquire, license and produce content, including original programming, in order to offer our members unlimited viewing of TV shows and films. The\ncontent licenses are for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability. Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more\nupfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense. Payments for content, including additions to streaming assets and the changes in related liabilities, are\nclassified within \"Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities\" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nFor licenses we capitalize the fee per title and record a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins, the cost of\nthe title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming. The portion available for streaming within one year is recognized as “Current content assets,\nnet” and the remaining portion as “Non-current content assets, net” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nFor productions we capitalize costs associated with the production, including development cost and direct costs. We include these amounts in \"Non-current\ncontent assets, net\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Participations and residuals are expensed in line with the amortization of production costs.\nBased on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns, we amortize the content assets (licensed and produced) in “Cost of revenues” on the\nConsolidated Statements of Operations, over the shorter of each title's contractual window of availability or estimated period of use, beginning with the month of\nfirst availability. The amortization period typically ranges from six months to five years. For most of our content, we amortize on a straight-line basis. For certain\ncontent where we expect more upfront viewing, due to the additional merchandising and marketing efforts, we amortize on an accelerated basis. We review factors\nthat impact the amortization of the content assets on a regular basis, including changes in merchandising and marketing efforts. Our estimates related to these\nfactors require considerable management judgment.  Changes in our estimates could have a significant impact on our future results of operations. In the third\nquarter of 2015, we changed the amortization method of certain content given changes in estimated viewing patterns of this content. The effect of this change in\nestimate was a $25.5 million increase in cost of revenues in the Domestic streaming segment, for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nContent assets are stated at the lower",

Unamortized costs for assets that have been, or are expected to be, abandoned are written off. No material write-down from\nunamortized cost to a lower net realizable value was recorded in any of the periods presented.\nWe have entered into certain licenses with collective management organizations (\"CMOs\"), and are currently involved in negotiations with other CMOs, that\nhold certain rights to music and other entertainment works \"publicly performed\" in connection with streaming content into various territories. Accruals for\nestimated license fees are recorded and then adjusted based on any changes in estimates. These amounts are included in the streaming content obligations. The\nresults of these negotiations are uncertain and may be materially different from management's estimates.\nIncome Taxes\nWe record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations using the asset and liability method.\nDeferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying\namounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The effect on deferred tax assets\nand liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if\nnecessary, by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain. There was no valuation allowance as of December 31, 2015 or\n2014.\nAlthough we believe our assumptions, judgments and estimates are reasonable, changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of any\ntax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.\nIn evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, in full or in part, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our past\noperating results, and our forecast of future earnings, future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. The assumptions utilized in\ndetermining future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses.\nActual operating results in future years could differ from our current assumptions, judgments and estimates.

We may recognize a tax benefit only if it is\nmore likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits\nrecognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized\nupon settlement. At December 31, 2015, our estimated gross unrecognized tax benefits were $17.1 million of which $13.5 million, if recognized, would favorably\nimpact our future earnings. Due to uncertainties in any tax audit outcome, our estimates of the ultimate settlement of our unrecognized tax positions may change\nand the actual tax benefits may differ significantly from the estimates. See Note 10 of Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further\ninformation regarding income taxes.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe grant fully vested non-qualified stock options to our employees on a monthly basis. As a result of immediate vesting, stock-based compensation expense\nis fully recognized on the grant date, and no estimate is required for post-vesting option forfeitures. Stock-based compensation expense at the grant date is based on\nthe total number of options granted and an estimate of the fair value of the awards.\nWe calculate the fair value of our stock option grants using a lattice-binomial model. This model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions.\nChanges in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of options granted and our results of operations could be impacted.\n•\nExpected Volatility: Prior to January 1, 2015, our computation of expected volatility was based on a blend of historical volatility of our common stock\nand implied volatility of tradable forward call options to purchase shares of our common stock, as low trade volume of our tradable forward call options\nprior to 2011 precluded sole reliance on implied volatility. Beginning on January 1, 2015, expected volatility is based solely on implied volatility. We\nbelieve that implied volatility of publicly traded options in our common stock is more reflective of market conditions and, given consistently high trade\nvolumes of the options, can reasonably be expected to be a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility of our common stock. An\nincrease/decrease of 10% in our computation of expected volatility would increase/decrease the total stock-based compensation expense by\napproximately $10.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\n•\nSuboptimal Exercise Factor:  ",

To achieve this objective, we follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor and help mitigate our exposure\nto interest rate and credit risk. The policy sets forth credit quality standards and limits our exposure to any one issuer, as well as our maximum exposure to various\nasset classes. We maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and short-term investments in a variety of securities. These securities are classified as available-for-sale\nand are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, included in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” within Stockholders' equity in the\nConsolidated Balance Sheets.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015 , we had no impairment charges associated with our short-term investment portfolio. Although we believe our current\ninvestment portfolio has very little risk of material impairment, we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity and can provide no assurance that\nour investment portfolio will remain materially unimpaired. Some of the securities we invest in may be subject to market risk due to changes in prevailing interest\nrates which may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate. For example, if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then-\nprevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises, the value of our investment will decline. At December 31, 2015 , our cash equivalents were generally\ninvested in money market funds, which are not subject to market risk\n29\n\n\nTable of Contents\nbecause the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate.

Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2015 . In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission (“COSO”) in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based on our assessment under the framework in Internal Control—\nIntegrated Framework (2013 framework), our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2015 .\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered\npublic accounting firm, as stated in their report that is included herein.\n \n(c)\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2015 that has materially affected,\nor is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n \n31\n\n\nTable of Contents\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nThe Board of Directors and Stockholders of Netflix, Inc.\nWe have audited Netflix, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated\nFramework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria).

We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the\npreparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial\nreporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of\nfinancial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of\nunauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with\nthe policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nIn our opinion, Netflix, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on the COSO\ncriteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of\nNetflix, Inc. as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows\nfor each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015 of Netflix, Inc. and our report dated January 28, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nSan Jose, California\nJanuary 28, 2016\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\n32\n\n\nTable of Contents\nItem 9B.\nOther Information\nNone.\n33\n\n\nTable of Contents\nPART III\n \nItem 10.\nDirectors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance\nInformation regarding our directors and executive officers is incorporated by reference from the information contained under the sections “Proposal One:\nElection of Directors,” “Section",

The Company is the world’s leading Internet\ntelevision network with over 75 million streaming members in over 190 countries enjoying more than 125 million hours of hours of TV shows and movies per day,\nincluding original series, documentaries and feature films. Members can watch as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, on nearly any Internet-connected screen.\nMembers can play, pause and resume watching, all without commercials or commitments. Additionally, in the United States (\"U.S.\"), members can receive DVDs.\nThe Company has three reportable segments, Domestic streaming, International streaming and Domestic DVD. A majority of the Company’s revenues are\ngenerated in the United States, and substantially all of the Company’s long-lived tangible assets are held in the United States. The Company’s revenues are derived\nfrom monthly membership fees.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions have\nbeen eliminated.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of\nthe financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant items subject to such estimates and\nassumptions include the amortization policy for the streaming content assets; the recognition and measurement of income tax assets and liabilities; and the\nvaluation of stock-based compensation. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to\nbe reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nStock Split\nOn July 14, 2015, the Company completed a  seven -for-one stock split in the form of a stock dividend. References made to outstanding shares or per share\namounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and applicable disclosures have been retroactively adjusted to reflect this  seven -for-one stock\nsplit.

The number of authorized shares as reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets was not affected by the stock split and accordingly has not been adjusted.\nSee Note 8 for additional information.\nAccounting Guidance Adopted in 2015\nIn April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2015-05, Customer's Accounting for Fees\nPaid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement, which provides guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. If a\ncloud computing arrangement includes a software license, the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the\nacquisition of other software licenses. If the arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for a cloud computing arrangement as a\nservice contract. The Company elected to early adopt the ASU in the third quarter of 2015 and has applied the guidance prospectively to all arrangements. The\nimpact of the adoption of the ASU was not material to the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs which changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in\nfinancial statements. ASU 2015-03 requires an entity to present such costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an\nasset. Amortization of the costs will continue to be reported as interest expense. The Company elected to early adopt ASU 2015-03 as of December 31, 2015, and\nretrospectively reclassifed $14.2 million of debt issuance costs associated with the Company's long-term debt as of December 31, 2014 from other non-current\nassets to long-term debt.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes.\nThe amendments in this update require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The\nCompany has elected to early adopt ASU 2015-17 as\n43\n\n\nTable of Contents\nof December 31, 2015 and retrospectively applied ASU 2015-17 to all periods presented. As of December 31, 2014 the Company reclassified $13.4 million of\ndeferred tax assets from \"Other current assets\" to \"Other non-current assets\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nAccounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) which amended the existing accounting standards for\nrevenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 establishes principles for recognizing revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers, in an amount that\nreflects the expected consideration received in exchange for those goods or services. In July 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date for annual reporting\nperiods beginning after December 15, 2017 (including interim reporting p",

Early adoption is permitted to the original effective date of\nDecember 15, 2016 (including interim reporting periods within those periods). The amendments may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or\nretrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of initial application. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of\nadoption of the ASU on its consolidated financial statements, but does not expect the impact to be material.\nCash Equivalents and Short-term Investments\nThe Company considers investments in instruments purchased with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. The Company also\nclassifies amounts in transit from payment processors for customer credit card and debit card transactions as cash equivalents.\nThe Company classifies short-term investments, which consist of marketable securities with original maturities in excess of 90 days as available-for-sale.\nShort-term investments are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” within Stockholders’ equity\nin the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amortization of premiums and discounts on the investments, realized gains and losses, and declines in value judged to be\nother-than-temporary on available-for-sale securities are included in “Interest and other income (expense)” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The\nCompany uses the specific identification method to determine cost in calculating realized gains and losses upon the sale of short-term investments.\nShort-term investments are reviewed periodically to identify possible other-than-temporary impairment. When evaluating the investments, the Company\nreviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer, the Company’s intent to\nsell, or whether it would be more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell the investments before the recovery of their amortized cost basis.\nStreaming Content\nThe Company acquires, licenses and produces content, including original programming, in order to offer members unlimited viewing of TV shows and films.\nThe content licenses are for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability. Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more\nupfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense. Payments for content, including additions to streaming assets and the changes in related liabilities, are\nclassified within \"Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities\" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nFor licenses, the Company capitalizes the fee per title and records a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins,\nthe cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming.

These amounts are included in\n\"Non-current content assets, net\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Participations and residuals are expensed in line with the amortization of production costs.\nBased on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns, the Company amortizes the content assets (licensed and produced) in “Cost of revenues”\non the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the shorter of each title's contractual window of availability or estimated period of use, beginning with the\nmonth of first availability. The amortization period typically ranges from six months to five years. For most of the content, the Company amortizes on a straight-\nline basis. For certain content where the Company expects more upfront viewing, due to the additional merchandising and marketing efforts, the amortization is on\nan accelerated basis. The Company reviews factors impacting the amortization of the content assets on a regular basis, including changes in merchandising and\nmarketing efforts. The Company's estimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment.  Changes in estimates could have a significant\nimpact on the Company's future results of operations. In the third quarter of 2015, the Company changed the amortization method of certain content given changes\nin estimated viewing patterns of this content. The effect of this change in estimate was a $25.5 million decrease in\n44\n\n\nTable of Contents\noperating income and a $15.8 million decrease in net income for the year ended December 31, 2015. The effect on both basic earnings per share and diluted\nearnings per share was a decrease of $0.04 for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nContent assets are stated at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value which approximates fair value of the capitalized costs for produced content.\nContent assets are reviewed in aggregate at the operating segment level for write-down when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the\nexpected usefulness of the content. Unamortized costs for assets that have been or are expected to be abandoned are written off. No material write-down from\nunamortized cost to a lower net realizable value was recorded in any of the periods presented.\nThe Company has entered into certain licenses with collective management organizations (\"CMOs\"), and are currently involved in negotiations with other\nCMOs, that hold certain rights to music and other entertainment works \"publicly performed\" in connection with streaming content into various territories.

The\nresults of these negotiations are uncertain and may be materially different from management's estimates.\nDVD Content\nThe Company acquires DVD content for the purpose of renting such content to its domestic DVD members and earning membership rental revenues, and, as\nsuch, the Company considers its direct purchase DVD assets to be a productive asset. Accordingly, the Company classifies its DVD assets in “Non-current content\nassets, net” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The acquisition of DVD content assets, net of changes in related liabilities, is classified within cash used in\ninvesting activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows because the DVD content assets are considered a productive asset. Other companies in the in-\nhome entertainment video industry classify these cash flows as operating activities. The Company amortizes its direct purchase DVDs on an accelerated basis over\ntheir estimated useful lives, which range from one year to two years. The Company also obtains DVD content through revenue sharing agreements with studios and\nother content providers. Revenue sharing obligations are expensed as incurred based on shipments.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the\nestimated useful lives of the respective assets, generally up to 30 years , or the lease term for leasehold improvements, if applicable. Leased buildings are\ncapitalized and included in property and equipment when the Company was involved in the construction funding and did not meet the “sale-leaseback” criteria.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues are recognized ratably over each monthly membership period. Revenues are presented net of the taxes that are collected from members and\nremitted to governmental authorities. Deferred revenue consists of membership fees billed that have not been recognized and gift and other prepaid memberships\nthat have not been redeemed.\nMarketing\nMarketing expenses consist primarily of advertising expenses and also include payments made to the Company’s affiliates and consumer electronics\npartners. Advertising expenses include promotional activities such as digital and television advertising. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising\nexpenses were $714.3 million , $533.1 million and $404.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company records a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability\nmethod. Deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement\ncarrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforward",

The measurement of deferred tax assets is\nreduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain.\nThe Company did not recognize certain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes. The Company may recognize a tax\nbenefit only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.\nThe tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of\nbeing realized upon\n45\n\n\nTable of Contents\nsettlement. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial\nstatements for further information regarding income taxes.\nForeign Currency\nThe functional currency for the Company's subsidiaries is determined based on the primary economic environment in which the subsidiary operates. The\nCompany translates the assets and liabilities of its non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of\neach period. Revenues and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. Gains and losses from these\ntranslations are recognized in cumulative translation adjustment included in \"Accumulated other comprehensive loss\" in Stockholders’ equity on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheets.\nPrior to January 1, 2015, the functional currency of certain of the Company's European entities was the British pound. The Company changed the functional\ncurrency of these entities to the euro effective January 1, 2015 following the redomiciliation of the European headquarters and the launch of the Netflix service in\nseveral significant European countries. The change in functional currency was applied prospectively from January 1, 2015. Monetary assets and liabilities have\nbeen remeasured to the euro at current exchange rates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities have been remeasured to the euro using the exchange rate effective for\nthe period in which the balance arose. As a result of this change of functional currency, the Company recorded a $21.8 million cumulative translation adjustment\nincluded in other comprehensive loss for year ended December 31, 2015.\nThe Company remeasures monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency at exchange rates in effect at the end of each\nperiod. Gains and losses from these remeasurements are recognized in interest and other income (expense).

Traditional film\noutput deals, like the U.S. output deal with Disney, or certain TV series license agreements where the number of seasons to be aired is unknown, are examples of\nsuch license agreements. The Company does not include any estimated obligation for these future titles beyond the known minimum amount. However, the\nunknown obligations are expected to be significant.\nLease obligations\nThe Company leases facilities under non-cancelable operating leases with various expiration dates through 2028. Several lease agreements contain rent\nescalation clauses or rent holidays. For purposes of recognizing minimum rental expenses on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases, the Company uses\nthe date of initial possession to begin amortization, which is generally when the Company enters the space and begins to make improvements in preparation for\nintended use. For scheduled rent escalation clauses during the lease terms or for rental payments commencing at a date other than the date of initial occupancy, the\nCompany records minimum rental expenses on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company has\nthe option to extend or renew most of its leases which may increase the future minimum lease commitments.\nBecause the terms of the Company’s facilities lease agreements for its original Los Gatos, California headquarters site required the Company’s involvement\nin the construction funding of the buildings, the Company is the “deemed owner” (for accounting purposes only) of these buildings. Accordingly, the Company\nrecorded an asset of $40.7 million , representing the total costs of the buildings and improvements, including the costs paid by the lessor (the legal owner of the\nbuildings), with corresponding liabilities. Upon completion of construction of each building, the Company did not meet the sale-leaseback criteria for de-\nrecognition of the building assets and liabilities. Therefore the leases are accounted for as financing obligations.\nIn the third quarter of 2015, the Company extended the facilities leases for the original Los Gatos buildings for an additional three years term, increasing the\nfuture minimum payments under the lease financing obligations by approximately $13.7 million . In this extension, the leases continue to be accounted for as\nfinancing obligations and no gain or loss was recorded as a result of the lease financing modification. At December 31, 2015, the lease financing obligation balance\nwas $29.0 million , the majority of which is recorded in “Other non-current liabilities,” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The remaining future minimum\npayments under the lease financing obligation are $21.1 million .

Beginning on January 1, 2015, the Company began aggregating employee groupings for its determination of the suboptimal\nexercise factor as the previous bifurcation into two groupings did not have a material impact on the fair value of the options granted.\nPrior to January 1, 2015, the Company's computation of expected volatility was based on a blend of historical volatility of its common stock and implied\nvolatility of tradable forward call options to purchase shares of its common stock, as low trade\n54\n\n\nTable of Contents\nvolume of its tradable forward call options prior to 2011 precluded sole reliance on implied volatility. Beginning on January 1, 2015, expected volatility is based\nsolely on implied volatility. The Company believes that implied volatility of publicly traded options in its common stock is more reflective of market conditions,\nand given consistently high trade volumes of the options, can reasonably be expected to be a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility of its\ncommon stock.\nIn valuing shares issued under the Company’s employee stock option plans, the Company bases the risk-free interest rate on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon\nissues with terms similar to the contractual term of the options. The Company does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore\nuses an expected dividend yield of  zero  in the option valuation model. The Company does not use a post-vesting termination rate as options are fully vested upon\ngrant date.\n9.

In December 2015, the Company reached a settlement with the IRS for tax years 2010 through\n2013. The 2014 Federal tax return remains subject to examination by the IRS. California had previously completed its Field Exam of the 2006 and 2007 California\ntax returns and had issued a Notice of Proposed Assessment primarily related to the Company's R&D Credits claimed in those years.

Segment information is presented along the\nsame lines that the Company’s chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\") reviews the operating results in assessing performance and allocating resources. The\nCompany’s CODM reviews revenue and contribution profit (loss) for each of the reportable segments. Contribution profit (loss) is defined as revenues less cost of\nrevenues and marketing expenses incurred by the segment. The Company has aggregated the results of the International operating segments into one reportable\nsegment because these operating segments share similar long-term economic and other qualitative characteristics.\nThe Domestic streaming segment derives revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of streaming content to the members in the\nUnited States. The International streaming segment derives revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of streaming content to\nmembers outside of the United States. The Domestic DVD segment derives revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of DVD-by-\nmail. Revenues and the related payment card fees are attributed to the operating segment based on the nature of the underlying membership (streaming or DVD)\nand the geographic region from which the membership originates. There are no internal revenue transactions between the Company’s segments.\nThe majority of cost of revenues relate to content expenses directly incurred by the segment. However, in connection with global expansion, content\nacquired, licensed, and produced increasingly includes global rights. The Company allocates this content between the International and Domestic streaming\nsegments based on estimated fair market value. Other costs of revenues such as delivery costs are primarily attributed to the operating segment based on amounts\ndirectly incurred by the segment.

(“Netflix”, “the Company”, “we”, or “us”) is the world’s leading Internet television network with over 75 million streaming members in over\n190 countries enjoying more than 125 million hours of TV shows and movies per day, including original series, documentaries and feature films. Our members can\nwatch as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, on nearly any Internet-connected screen. Members can play, pause and resume watching, all without commercials\nor commitments. Additionally, in the United States (\"U.S.\"), our members can receive DVDs delivered quickly to their homes.\nWe are a pioneer in the Internet delivery of TV shows and movies, launching our streaming service in 2007. Since this launch, we have developed an\necosystem for Internet-connected screens and have added increasing amounts of content that enable consumers to enjoy TV shows and movies directly on their\nInternet-connected screens. As a result of these efforts, we have experienced growing consumer acceptance of, and interest in, the delivery of TV shows and\nmovies directly over the Internet.\nOur core strategy is to grow our streaming membership business globally within the parameters of our consolidated net income and operating segment\ncontribution profit (loss) targets. We are continuously improving our members' experience by expanding our streaming content with a focus on a programming mix\nof content that delights our members. In addition, we are perpetually enhancing our user interface and extendin",

We began our international expansion with Canada in 2010 and have since\nlaunched our service globally, with the exception of The People's Republic of China and territories where U.S. companies are not allowed to operate. We have also\nexpanded our streaming content offering to include more exclusive and original programming, including several Emmy, Golden Globe and Academy Award\nnominated original series and documentaries. Our original programming increasingly includes content that we produce.\n \nBUSINESS SEGMENTS\nThe Company has three reportable segments: Domestic streaming, International streaming and Domestic DVD. The Domestic streaming segment derives\nrevenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of streaming content to our members in the United States. The International streaming\nsegment derives revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of streaming content to our members outside the United States. The\nDomestic DVD segment derives revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of DVD-by-mail. For additional information regarding our\nsegments, including information about our financial results by geography, see Note 12 of Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data .\n1\n\n\nTable of Contents\nCOMPETITION\nThe market for entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. We compete against other entertainment video providers, such as\nmultichannel video programming distributors (\"MVPDs\"), Internet-based movie and TV content providers (including those that provide pirated content), video\ngaming providers and DVD rental outlets and more broadly against other sources of entertainment that our members could choose in their moments of free time.\nWe also compete against entertainment video providers in obtaining content that our members love, both for licensed streaming content and for original content\nprojects.\nWhile consumers may maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple entertainment sources, we strive for consumers to choose us in their moments of\nfree time. We have often referred to this choice as our objective of \"winning moments of truth.\" In attempting to win these moments of truth with our members, we\nare continually improving our service, including both our technology and our content, which is increasingly exclusive and curated, and includes our own original\nprogramming.\nSEASONALITY\nOur membership growth exhibits a seasonal pattern that reflects variations when consumers buy Internet-connected screens and when they tend to increase\ntheir viewing. Historically, the first and fourth quarters (October through March)represent our greatest membership growth across our Domestic and International\nstreaming segments and the fewest membership losses in our Domestic DVD segment.

Our ability to continue to attract members will depend in part on our ability\nto consistently provide our members with compelling content choices, as well as a quality experience for selecting and viewing TV shows and movies.\nFurthermore, the relative service levels, content offerings, pricing and related features of competitors to our service may adversely impact our ability to attract and\nretain memberships. Competitors include other entertainment video providers, such as MVPDs, Internet-based movie and TV content providers (including those\nthat provide pirated content) and DVD rental outlets. If consumers do not perceive our service offering to be of value, including if we introduce new or adjust\nexisting features, adjust pricing or service offerings, or change the mix of content in a manner that is not favorably received by them, we may not be able to attract\nand retain members. In addition, many of our members are rejoining our service or originate from word-of-mouth advertising from existing members. If our efforts\nto satisfy our existing members are not successful, we may not be able to attract members, and as a result, our ability to maintain and/or grow our business will be\nadversely affected. Members cancel our service for many reasons, including a perception that they do not use the service sufficiently, the need to cut household\nexpenses, availability of content is unsatisfactory, competitive services provide a better value or experience and customer service issues are not satisfactorily\nresolved. We must continually add new memberships both to replace canceled memberships and to grow our business beyond our current membership base. If\ngrowth rates slow faster than expected, given, in particular that our content costs are largely fixed in nature and contracted over several years, we may not be able\nto adjust our expenditures or increase our (per membership) revenues commensurate with the lowered growth rate such that our margins, liquidity and results of\noperation may be adversely impacted. If we are unable to successfully compete with current and new competitors in both retaining our existing memberships and\nattracting new memberships, our business will be adversely affected. Further, if excessive numbers of members cancel our service, we may be required to incur\nsignificantly higher marketing expenditures than we currently anticipate to replace these members with new members.\nChanges in competitive offerings for entertainment video, including the potential rapid adoption of piracy-based video offerings, could adversely impact\nour business.\nThe market for entertainment video is intense",

The various economic models underlying these channels include subscription, transactional, ad-supported and\npiracy-based models. All of these have the potential to capture meaningful segments of the entertainment video market. Piracy, in particular, threatens to damage\nour business, as its fundamental proposition to consumers is so compelling and difficult to compete against: virtually all content for free. Furthermore, in light of\nthe compelling consumer proposition, piracy services are subject to rapid global growth. Traditional providers of entertainment video, including broadcasters and\ncable network operators, as well as Internet based e-commerce or entertainment video providers are increasing their Internet-based video offerings. Several of these\ncompetitors have long operating histories, large customer bases, strong brand recognition and significant financial, marketing and other resources.

In July 2011, we separated the combined plans, making it necessary for members who wish to receive both DVDs-by-mail and streaming\ncontent to have two separate membership plans. Prior to these changes to our pricing and plan structure in 2011, we did not separately track streaming\nmemberships.\n(1)\nA membership (also referred to as a subscription or a member) is defined as the right to receive the Netflix service following sign-up and a method of\npayment being provided. Memberships are assigned to territories based on the geographic location used at time of sign-up as determined by our internal\nsystems, which utilize industry standard geo-location technology. We offer free-trial memberships to new and certain rejoining members. Total members\ninclude those who are on a free-trial as long as a method of payment has been provided. A membership is canceled and ceases to be reflected in the above\nmetrics as of the effective cancellation date. Voluntary cancellations become effective at the end of the prepaid membership period, while involuntary\ncancellation of the service, as a result of a failed method of payment, becomes effective immediately except in limited circumstances where a short grace\nperiod is offered to ensure the streaming service is not interrupted for members who are impacted by payment processing delays by our banks or integrated\npayment partners.

For the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015, the impact from membership growth was slightly offset by a decrease in average monthly revenue per paying streaming membership resulting\nfrom unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations impacting our International streaming segment. This was partially offset by increases resulting from price changes\nand plan mix. The decrease in operating income for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 is due primarily to\nincreased marketing and headcount costs to support our international expansion in addition to increased content expenses as we continue to acquire, license and\nproduce content, including more Netflix originals. Net income is further impacted by the increase in interest expense associated with our debt issuance in the first\nquarter of 2015 as well as to an increase in losses on foreign currency denominated transactions.\nWe offer three types of streaming membership plans. In the U.S. our basic plan is priced at $7.99 per month and includes access to standard definition quality\nstreaming on a single screen at a time. Our most popular streaming plan is priced at $9.99 per month and includes access to high definition quality streaming on\ntwo screens concurrently. Our premium plan is priced at $11.99 per month and includes access to high definition and ultra-high definition quality content on four\nscreens concurrently. Internationally, the membership plans are structured similarly to the U.S. and range in price from the U.S. dollar equivalent of approximately\n$5.00 to $18.00 per month.\nWe expect that from time to time the prices of our membership plans in each country may change. For instance, in the second half of 2015, we increased the\nprice of our two-screen high definition plan in the U.S. and several European countries. In May 2014, in the U.S., we increased the price of our high definition plan\nfrom $7.99 per month to $8.99 per month with existing memberships grandfathered for a two year period. In October 2015, in the U.S., we increased the price of\nthis same high definition plan from $8.99 per month to $9.99 per month with existing memberships grandfathered for a one year period. In 2016, the grandfathered\npricing period will expire for a substantial number of U.S. memberships and the members will have the option of electing the basic streaming plan at $7.99 or\ncontinuing on the high definition plan at the higher price of $9.99.\nThe following represents the key elements to our segment results of operations:\n•\nWe define contribu",

We believe this is an important\nmeasure of our operating segment performance as it represents each segment's performance before global corporate costs.\n•\nFor the Domestic and International streaming segments, content expenses, which include the amortization of the streaming content assets and other\nexpenses associated with the licensing and acquisition of streaming content, represent the vast majority of cost of revenues. Streaming content rights were\ngenerally obtained for our current geographic regions. As we expanded internationally, we obtained additional rights for the new geographies. With our\nglobal expansion, we now aspire to obtain global rights for our new content. We allocate this content between the Domestic and International segments\nbased on estimated fair market value.

Cost of revenues in the Domestic DVD segment consist primarily of\ndelivery expenses, content expenses, including amortization of DVD content assets and revenue sharing expenses, and other expenses associated with our\nDVD processing and customer service centers. Delivery expenses for the Domestic DVD segment consist of the postage costs to mail DVDs to and from\nour members and the packaging and label costs for the mailers.\n•\nFor the Domestic and International streaming segments, marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising expenses and payments made to our affiliates\nand device partners. Advertising expenses include promotional activities such as digital and television advertising. Payments to our affiliates and device\npartners include fixed fee and /or revenue sharing payments. Marketing expenses are incurred by our Domestic and International streaming segments\ngiven our focus on building consumer awareness of the streaming offerings and in particular our original content.

Our ability to obtain this, or\nany additional financing that we may choose to, or need to, obtain to finance our international expansion, or investment in original content or otherwise, will\ndepend on, among other things, our development efforts, business plans, operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek\nfinancing.

The excess content payments over\nexpense is variable based on the payment terms of our content agreements and is expected to increase as we enter into more agreements with upfront cash\npayments, such as licensing and production of original content.

The contractual obligations table above does not include any estimated obligation for the unknown\nfuture titles, payment for which could range from less than one year to more than five years. However, these unknown obligations are expected to be\nsignificant and we believe could include approximately $3 billion to $5 billion over the next three years, with the payments for the vast majority of such\namounts expected to occur after the next twelve months.

We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the\ncircumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n27\n\n\nTable of Contents\nStreaming Content\nWe acquire, license and produce content, including original programming, in order to offer our members unlimited viewing of TV shows and films. The\ncontent licenses are for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability. Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more\nupfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense. Payments for content, including additions to streaming assets and the changes in related liabilities, are\nclassified within \"Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities\" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nFor licenses we capitalize the fee per title and record a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins, the cost of\nthe title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming. The portion available for streaming within one year is recognized as “Current content assets,\nnet” and the remaining portion as “Non-current content assets, net” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nFor productions we capitalize costs associated with the production, including development cost and direct costs. We include these amounts in \"Non-current\ncontent assets, net\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Participations and residuals are expensed in line with the amortization of production costs.\nBased on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns, we amortize the content assets (licensed and produced) in “Cost of revenues” on the\nConsolidated Statements of Operations, over the shorter of each title's contractual window of availability or estimated period of use, beginning with the month of\nfirst availability. The amortization period typically ranges from six months to five years. For most of our content, we amortize on a straight-line basis. For certain\ncontent where we expect more upfront viewing, due to the additional merchandising and marketing efforts, we amortize on an accelerated basis. We review factors\nthat impact the amortization of the content assets on a regular basis, including changes in merchandising and marketing efforts. Our estimates related to these\nfactors require considerable management judgment.  Changes in our estimates could have a significant impact on our future results of operations. In the third\nquarter of 2015, we changed the amortization method of certain content given changes in estimated viewing patterns of this content. The effect of this change in\nestimate was a $25.5 million increase in cost of revenues in the Domestic streaming segment, for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nContent assets are stated at the lower",

Unamortized costs for assets that have been, or are expected to be, abandoned are written off. No material write-down from\nunamortized cost to a lower net realizable value was recorded in any of the periods presented.\nWe have entered into certain licenses with collective management organizations (\"CMOs\"), and are currently involved in negotiations with other CMOs, that\nhold certain rights to music and other entertainment works \"publicly performed\" in connection with streaming content into various territories. Accruals for\nestimated license fees are recorded and then adjusted based on any changes in estimates. These amounts are included in the streaming content obligations. The\nresults of these negotiations are uncertain and may be materially different from management's estimates.\nIncome Taxes\nWe record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations using the asset and liability method.\nDeferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying\namounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The effect on deferred tax assets\nand liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if\nnecessary, by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain. There was no valuation allowance as of December 31, 2015 or\n2014.\nAlthough we believe our assumptions, judgments and estimates are reasonable, changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of any\ntax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.\nIn evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, in full or in part, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our past\noperating results, and our forecast of future earnings, future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. The assumptions utilized in\ndetermining future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses.\nActual operating results in future years could differ from our current assumptions, judgments and estimates.

We may recognize a tax benefit only if it is\nmore likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits\nrecognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized\nupon settlement. At December 31, 2015, our estimated gross unrecognized tax benefits were $17.1 million of which $13.5 million, if recognized, would favorably\nimpact our future earnings. Due to uncertainties in any tax audit outcome, our estimates of the ultimate settlement of our unrecognized tax positions may change\nand the actual tax benefits may differ significantly from the estimates. See Note 10 of Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further\ninformation regarding income taxes.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe grant fully vested non-qualified stock options to our employees on a monthly basis. As a result of immediate vesting, stock-based compensation expense\nis fully recognized on the grant date, and no estimate is required for post-vesting option forfeitures. Stock-based compensation expense at the grant date is based on\nthe total number of options granted and an estimate of the fair value of the awards.\nWe calculate the fair value of our stock option grants using a lattice-binomial model. This model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions.\nChanges in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of options granted and our results of operations could be impacted.\n•\nExpected Volatility: Prior to January 1, 2015, our computation of expected volatility was based on a blend of historical volatility of our common stock\nand implied volatility of tradable forward call options to purchase shares of our common stock, as low trade volume of our tradable forward call options\nprior to 2011 precluded sole reliance on implied volatility. Beginning on January 1, 2015, expected volatility is based solely on implied volatility. We\nbelieve that implied volatility of publicly traded options in our common stock is more reflective of market conditions and, given consistently high trade\nvolumes of the options, can reasonably be expected to be a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility of our common stock. An\nincrease/decrease of 10% in our computation of expected volatility would increase/decrease the total stock-based compensation expense by\napproximately $10.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\n•\nSuboptimal Exercise Factor:  ",

To achieve this objective, we follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor and help mitigate our exposure\nto interest rate and credit risk. The policy sets forth credit quality standards and limits our exposure to any one issuer, as well as our maximum exposure to various\nasset classes. We maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and short-term investments in a variety of securities. These securities are classified as available-for-sale\nand are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, included in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” within Stockholders' equity in the\nConsolidated Balance Sheets.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015 , we had no impairment charges associated with our short-term investment portfolio. Although we believe our current\ninvestment portfolio has very little risk of material impairment, we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity and can provide no assurance that\nour investment portfolio will remain materially unimpaired. Some of the securities we invest in may be subject to market risk due to changes in prevailing interest\nrates which may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate. For example, if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then-\nprevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises, the value of our investment will decline. At December 31, 2015 , our cash equivalents were generally\ninvested in money market funds, which are not subject to market risk\n29\n\n\nTable of Contents\nbecause the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate.

(the “Company”) was incorporated on August 29, 1997 and began operations on April 14, 1998. The Company is the world’s leading Internet\ntelevision network with over 75 million streaming members in over 190 countries enjoying more than 125 million hours of hours of TV shows and movies per day,\nincluding original series, documentaries and feature films. Members can watch as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, on nearly any Internet-connected screen.\nMembers can play, pause and resume watching, all without commercials or commitments. Additionally, in the United States (\"U.S.\"), members can receive DVDs.\nThe Company has three reportable segments, Domestic streaming, International streaming and Domestic DVD. A majority of the Company’s revenues are\ngenerated in the United States, and substantially all of the Company’s long-lived tangible assets are held in the United States. The Company’s revenues are derived\nfrom monthly membership fees.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions have\nbeen eliminated.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of\nthe financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant items subject to such estimates and\nassumptions include the amortization policy for the streaming content assets; the recognition and measurement of income tax assets and liabilities; and the\nvaluation of stock-based compensation. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to\nbe reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nStock Split\nOn July 14, 2015, the Company completed a  seven -for-one stock split in the form of a stock dividend. References made to outstanding shares or per share\namounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and applicable disclosures have been retroactively adjusted to reflect this  seven -for-one stock\nsplit.

The number of authorized shares as reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets was not affected by the stock split and accordingly has not been adjusted.\nSee Note 8 for additional information.\nAccounting Guidance Adopted in 2015\nIn April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2015-05, Customer's Accounting for Fees\nPaid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement, which provides guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. If a\ncloud computing arrangement includes a software license, the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the\nacquisition of other software licenses. If the arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for a cloud computing arrangement as a\nservice contract. The Company elected to early adopt the ASU in the third quarter of 2015 and has applied the guidance prospectively to all arrangements. The\nimpact of the adoption of the ASU was not material to the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs which changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in\nfinancial statements. ASU 2015-03 requires an entity to present such costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an\nasset. Amortization of the costs will continue to be reported as interest expense. The Company elected to early adopt ASU 2015-03 as of December 31, 2015, and\nretrospectively reclassifed $14.2 million of debt issuance costs associated with the Company's long-term debt as of December 31, 2014 from other non-current\nassets to long-term debt.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes.\nThe amendments in this update require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The\nCompany has elected to early adopt ASU 2015-17 as\n43\n\n\nTable of Contents\nof December 31, 2015 and retrospectively applied ASU 2015-17 to all periods presented. As of December 31, 2014 the Company reclassified $13.4 million of\ndeferred tax assets from \"Other current assets\" to \"Other non-current assets\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nAccounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) which amended the existing accounting standards for\nrevenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 establishes principles for recognizing revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers, in an amount that\nreflects the expected consideration received in exchange for those goods or services. In July 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date for annual reporting\nperiods beginning after December 15, 2017 (including interim reporting p",

Early adoption is permitted to the original effective date of\nDecember 15, 2016 (including interim reporting periods within those periods). The amendments may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or\nretrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of initial application. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of\nadoption of the ASU on its consolidated financial statements, but does not expect the impact to be material.\nCash Equivalents and Short-term Investments\nThe Company considers investments in instruments purchased with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. The Company also\nclassifies amounts in transit from payment processors for customer credit card and debit card transactions as cash equivalents.\nThe Company classifies short-term investments, which consist of marketable securities with original maturities in excess of 90 days as available-for-sale.\nShort-term investments are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” within Stockholders’ equity\nin the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amortization of premiums and discounts on the investments, realized gains and losses, and declines in value judged to be\nother-than-temporary on available-for-sale securities are included in “Interest and other income (expense)” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The\nCompany uses the specific identification method to determine cost in calculating realized gains and losses upon the sale of short-term investments.\nShort-term investments are reviewed periodically to identify possible other-than-temporary impairment. When evaluating the investments, the Company\nreviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer, the Company’s intent to\nsell, or whether it would be more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell the investments before the recovery of their amortized cost basis.\nStreaming Content\nThe Company acquires, licenses and produces content, including original programming, in order to offer members unlimited viewing of TV shows and films.\nThe content licenses are for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability. Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more\nupfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense. Payments for content, including additions to streaming assets and the changes in related liabilities, are\nclassified within \"Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities\" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nFor licenses, the Company capitalizes the fee per title and records a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins,\nthe cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming.

These amounts are included in\n\"Non-current content assets, net\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Participations and residuals are expensed in line with the amortization of production costs.\nBased on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns, the Company amortizes the content assets (licensed and produced) in “Cost of revenues”\non the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the shorter of each title's contractual window of availability or estimated period of use, beginning with the\nmonth of first availability. The amortization period typically ranges from six months to five years. For most of the content, the Company amortizes on a straight-\nline basis. For certain content where the Company expects more upfront viewing, due to the additional merchandising and marketing efforts, the amortization is on\nan accelerated basis. The Company reviews factors impacting the amortization of the content assets on a regular basis, including changes in merchandising and\nmarketing efforts. The Company's estimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment.  Changes in estimates could have a significant\nimpact on the Company's future results of operations. In the third quarter of 2015, the Company changed the amortization method of certain content given changes\nin estimated viewing patterns of this content. The effect of this change in estimate was a $25.5 million decrease in\n44\n\n\nTable of Contents\noperating income and a $15.8 million decrease in net income for the year ended December 31, 2015. The effect on both basic earnings per share and diluted\nearnings per share was a decrease of $0.04 for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nContent assets are stated at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value which approximates fair value of the capitalized costs for produced content.\nContent assets are reviewed in aggregate at the operating segment level for write-down when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the\nexpected usefulness of the content. Unamortized costs for assets that have been or are expected to be abandoned are written off.

The\nresults of these negotiations are uncertain and may be materially different from management's estimates.\nDVD Content\nThe Company acquires DVD content for the purpose of renting such content to its domestic DVD members and earning membership rental revenues, and, as\nsuch, the Company considers its direct purchase DVD assets to be a productive asset. Accordingly, the Company classifies its DVD assets in “Non-current content\nassets, net” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The acquisition of DVD content assets, net of changes in related liabilities, is classified within cash used in\ninvesting activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows because the DVD content assets are considered a productive asset. Other companies in the in-\nhome entertainment video industry classify these cash flows as operating activities. The Company amortizes its direct purchase DVDs on an accelerated basis over\ntheir estimated useful lives, which range from one year to two years. The Company also obtains DVD content through revenue sharing agreements with studios and\nother content providers. Revenue sharing obligations are expensed as incurred based on shipments.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the\nestimated useful lives of the respective assets, generally up to 30 years , or the lease term for leasehold improvements, if applicable. Leased buildings are\ncapitalized and included in property and equipment when the Company was involved in the construction funding and did not meet the “sale-leaseback” criteria.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues are recognized ratably over each monthly membership period. Revenues are presented net of the taxes that are collected from members and\nremitted to governmental authorities. Deferred revenue consists of membership fees billed that have not been recognized and gift and other prepaid memberships\nthat have not been redeemed.\nMarketing\nMarketing expenses consist primarily of advertising expenses and also include payments made to the Company’s affiliates and consumer electronics\npartners. Advertising expenses include promotional activities such as digital and television advertising. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising\nexpenses were $714.3 million , $533.1 million and $404.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company records a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability\nmethod. Deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement\ncarrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforward",

The measurement of deferred tax assets is\nreduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain.\nThe Company did not recognize certain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes. The Company may recognize a tax\nbenefit only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.\nThe tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of\nbeing realized upon\n45\n\n\nTable of Contents\nsettlement. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial\nstatements for further information regarding income taxes.\nForeign Currency\nThe functional currency for the Company's subsidiaries is determined based on the primary economic environment in which the subsidiary operates. The\nCompany translates the assets and liabilities of its non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of\neach period. Revenues and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. Gains and losses from these\ntranslations are recognized in cumulative translation adjustment included in \"Accumulated other comprehensive loss\" in Stockholders’ equity on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheets.\nPrior to January 1, 2015, the functional currency of certain of the Company's European entities was the British pound. The Company changed the functional\ncurrency of these entities to the euro effective January 1, 2015 following the redomiciliation of the European headquarters and the launch of the Netflix service in\nseveral significant European countries. The change in functional currency was applied prospectively from January 1, 2015. Monetary assets and liabilities have\nbeen remeasured to the euro at current exchange rates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities have been remeasured to the euro using the exchange rate effective for\nthe period in which the balance arose. As a result of this change of functional currency, the Company recorded a $21.8 million cumulative translation adjustment\nincluded in other comprehensive loss for year ended December 31, 2015.\nThe Company remeasures monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency at exchange rates in effect at the end of each\nperiod. Gains and losses from these remeasurements are recognized in interest and other income (expense). Foreign currency transactions resulted in losses of\n$37.3 million , $8.2 million , and $8.4 million for the years ended December ",

Traditional film\noutput deals, like the U.S. output deal with Disney, or certain TV series license agreements where the number of seasons to be aired is unknown, are examples of\nsuch license agreements. The Company does not include any estimated obligation for these future titles beyond the known minimum amount. However, the\nunknown obligations are expected to be significant.\nLease obligations\nThe Company leases facilities under non-cancelable operating leases with various expiration dates through 2028. Several lease agreements contain rent\nescalation clauses or rent holidays. For purposes of recognizing minimum rental expenses on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases, the Company uses\nthe date of initial possession to begin amortization, which is generally when the Company enters the space and begins to make improvements in preparation for\nintended use. For scheduled rent escalation clauses during the lease terms or for rental payments commencing at a date other than the date of initial occupancy, the\nCompany records minimum rental expenses on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company has\nthe option to extend or renew most of its leases which may increase the future minimum lease commitments.\nBecause the terms of the Company’s facilities lease agreements for its original Los Gatos, California headquarters site required the Company’s involvement\nin the construction funding of the buildings, the Company is the “deemed owner” (for accounting purposes only) of these buildings. Accordingly, the Company\nrecorded an asset of $40.7 million , representing the total costs of the buildings and improvements, including the costs paid by the lessor (the legal owner of the\nbuildings), with corresponding liabilities. Upon completion of construction of each building, the Company did not meet the sale-leaseback criteria for de-\nrecognition of the building assets and liabilities. Therefore the leases are accounted for as financing obligations.\nIn the third quarter of 2015, the Company extended the facilities leases for the original Los Gatos buildings for an additional three years term, increasing the\nfuture minimum payments under the lease financing obligations by approximately $13.7 million . In this extension, the leases continue to be accounted for as\nfinancing obligations and no gain or loss was recorded as a result of the lease financing modification. At December 31, 2015, the lease financing obligation balance\nwas $29.0 million , the majority of which is recorded in “Other non-current liabilities,” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The remaining future minimum\npayments under the lease financing obligation are $21.1 million . The lease financing obligation balance at the end of the extended lease term will be\napproximately $21.8 million which a",

The Company believes that implied volatility of publicly traded options in its common stock is more reflective of market conditions,\nand given consistently high trade volumes of the options, can reasonably be expected to be a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility of its\ncommon stock.\nIn valuing shares issued under the Company’s employee stock option plans, the Company bases the risk-free interest rate on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon\nissues with terms similar to the contractual term of the options. The Company does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore\nuses an expected dividend yield of  zero  in the option valuation model.

In\nevaluating its ability to realize the net deferred tax assets, the Company considered all available positive and negative evidence, including its past operating results\nand the forecast of future market growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. As of December 31, 2015\nand 2014 , it was considered more likely than not that substantially all deferred tax assets would be realized, and no valuation allowance was recorded.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company's Federal R&D tax credit and state tax credit carryforwards for tax return purposes were $44.1 million , and $59.3\nmillion , respectively. The Federal R&D tax credit carryforwards expire through 2035.

These net operating losses were generated as a result of excess stock option deductions. Pursuant to Accounting Standards\nCodification 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation , the Company has not recognized the related $45.0 million tax benefit from the Federal and state net\noperating losses attributable to excess stock option deductions in gross deferred tax assets. The $45.0 million tax benefit will be credited directly to additional paid-\nin capital when net operating losses attributable to excess stock option deductions are utilized to reduce taxes payable.\nIncome tax benefits attributable to the exercise of employee stock options of $79.9 million , $88.9 million and $80.0 million for the years ended December\n31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, were recorded directly to additional paid-in-capital.\nThe Company classified $3.6 million of unrecognized tax benefits that are expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year as “Accrued\nexpenses”. The unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year are classified as “Other non-current\nliabilities” and a reduction of deferred tax assets which is classified as \"Other non-current assets\" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Interest and penalties included in the Company's provision for income taxes were not material in all the periods presented.\nThe Company files U.S. Federal, state and foreign tax returns. In December 2015, the Company reached a settlement with the IRS for tax years 2010 through\n2013. The 2014 Federal tax return remains subject to examination by the IRS. California had previously completed its Field Exam of the 2006 and 2007 California\ntax returns and had issued a Notice of Proposed Assessment primarily related to the Company's R&D Credits claimed in those years. The Company filed a protest\nagainst the proposed assessment and settlement was reached with the Franchise Tax Board for tax years 1997 through 2007 in November 2015. The years 2008\nthrough 2014, remain subject to examination by the state of California. As a result of the above audit settlements, the Company has reassessed the tax reserves on\nthe related uncertain tax position for all open years and released $13.4 million of tax reserves in the fourth quarter of 2015. The Company has no significant foreign\njurisdiction audits underway. The years 2011 through 2014 remain subject to examination by foreign jurisdictions.\nGiven the potential outcome of the current examinations as well as the impact of the current examinations on the potential expiration of the statute of\nlimitations, it is reasonably possible that the balance of unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change within the next twelve months. However, an estimate\nof the range of reasonably possible adjustments cannot be made.\n11.\nEmployee Benefit Plan\nThe Company maintains a 401(k) savings plan covering substantially all of its employees.

Segment information is presented along the\nsame lines that the Company’s chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\") reviews the operating results in assessing performance and allocating resources. The\nCompany’s CODM reviews revenue and contribution profit (loss) for each of the reportable segments. Contribution profit (loss) is defined as revenues less cost of\nrevenues and marketing expenses incurred by the segment. The Company has aggregated the results of the International operating segments into one reportable\nsegment because these operating segments share similar long-term economic and other qualitative characteristics.\nThe Domestic streaming segment derives revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of streaming content to the members in the\nUnited States. The International streaming segment derives revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of streaming content to\nmembers outside of the United States. The Domestic DVD segment derives revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of DVD-by-\nmail. Revenues and the related payment card fees are attributed to the operating segment based on the nature of the underlying membership (streaming or DVD)\nand the geographic region from which the membership originates. There are no internal revenue transactions between the Company’s segments.\nThe majority of cost of revenues relate to content expenses directly incurred by the segment. However, in connection with global expansion, content\nacquired, licensed, and produced increasingly includes global rights. The Company allocates this content between the International and Domestic streaming\nsegments based on estimated fair market value. Other costs of revenues such as delivery costs are primarily attributed to the operating segment based on amounts\ndirectly incurred by the segment. Marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising expenses and payments made to our affiliates and device partners which are\ngenerally included in the segment in which the expenditures are directly incurred.\nThe Company's long-lived tangible assets were located as follows:\nAs of December 31,\n2015\n2014\n(in thousands)\nUnited States\n$\n159,566\n$\n138,704\nInternational\n13,846\n11,171\n58\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe following tables represent segment information for the year ended December 31, 2015:\n \n \nAs of/Year ended December 31, 2015\n \nDomestic\nStreaming\nInternational\nStreaming\nDomestic\nDVD\nConsolidated\n \n(in thousands)\nTotal memberships at end of period (1)\n44,738\n30,024\n4,904\n—\nRevenues\n$\n4,180,339\n$\n1,953,435\n$\n645",

(“Netflix”, “the Company”, “we”, or “us”) is the world’s leading Internet television network with over 75 million streaming members in over\n190 countries enjoying more than 125 million hours of TV shows and movies per day, including original series, documentaries and feature films. Our members can\nwatch as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, on nearly any Internet-connected screen. Members can play, pause and resume watching, all without commercials\nor commitments. Additionally, in the United States (\"U.S.\"), our members can receive DVDs delivered quickly to their homes.\nWe are a pioneer in the Internet delivery of TV shows and movies, launching our streaming service in 2007. Since this launch, we have developed an\necosystem for Internet-connected screens and have added increasing amounts of content that enable consumers to enjoy TV shows and movies directly on their\nInternet-connected screens. As a result of these efforts, we have experienced growing consumer acceptance of, and interest in, the delivery of TV shows and\nmovies directly over the Internet.\nOur core strategy is to grow our streaming membership business globally within the parameters of our consolidated net income and operating segment\ncontribution profit (loss) targets. We are continuously improving our members' experience by expanding our streaming content with a focus on a programming mix\nof content that delights our members.

We began our international expansion with Canada in 2010 and have since\nlaunched our service globally, with the exception of The People's Republic of China and territories where U.S. companies are not allowed to operate. We have also\nexpanded our streaming content offering to include more exclusive and original programming, including several Emmy, Golden Globe and Academy Award\nnominated original series and documentaries. Our original programming increasingly includes content that we produce.\n \nBUSINESS SEGMENTS\nThe Company has three reportable segments: Domestic streaming, International streaming and Domestic DVD. The Domestic streaming segment derives\nrevenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of streaming content to our members in the United States. The International streaming\nsegment derives revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of streaming content to our members outside the United States. The\nDomestic DVD segment derives revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of DVD-by-mail. For additional information regarding our\nsegments, including information about our financial results by geography, see Note 12 of Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data .\n1\n\n\nTable of Contents\nCOMPETITION\nThe market for entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. We compete against other entertainment video providers, such as\nmultichannel video programming distributors (\"MVPDs\"), Internet-based movie and TV content providers (including those that provide pirated content), video\ngaming providers and DVD rental outlets and more broadly against other sources of entertainment that our members could choose in their moments of free time.\nWe also compete against entertainment video providers in obtaining content that our members love, both for licensed streaming content and for original content\nprojects.\nWhile consumers may maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple entertainment sources, we strive for consumers to choose us in their moments of\nfree time. We have often referred to this choice as our objective of \"winning moments of truth.\" In attempting to win these moments of truth with our members, we\nare continually improving our service, including both our technology and our content, which is increasingly exclusive and curated, and includes our own original\nprogramming.\nSEASONALITY\nOur membership growth exhibits a seasonal pattern that reflects variations when consumers buy Internet-connected screens and when they tend to increase\ntheir viewing. Historically, the first and fourth quarters (October through March)represent our greatest membership growth across our Domestic and International\nstreaming segments and the fewest membership losses in our Domestic DVD segment.

Our ability to continue to attract members will depend in part on our ability\nto consistently provide our members with compelling content choices, as well as a quality experience for selecting and viewing TV shows and movies.\nFurthermore, the relative service levels, content offerings, pricing and related features of competitors to our service may adversely impact our ability to attract and\nretain memberships. Competitors include other entertainment video providers, such as MVPDs, Internet-based movie and TV content providers (including those\nthat provide pirated content) and DVD rental outlets. If consumers do not perceive our service offering to be of value, including if we introduce new or adjust\nexisting features, adjust pricing or service offerings, or change the mix of content in a manner that is not favorably received by them, we may not be able to attract\nand retain members. In addition, many of our members are rejoining our service or originate from word-of-mouth advertising from existing members. If our efforts\nto satisfy our existing members are not successful, we may not be able to attract members, and as a result, our ability to maintain and/or grow our business will be\nadversely affected. Members cancel our service for many reasons, including a perception that they do not use the service sufficiently, the need to cut household\nexpenses, availability of content is unsatisfactory, competitive services provide a better value or experience and customer service issues are not satisfactorily\nresolved. We must continually add new memberships both to replace canceled memberships and to grow our business beyond our current membership base. If\ngrowth rates slow faster than expected, given, in particular that our content costs are largely fixed in nature and contracted over several years, we may not be able\nto adjust our expenditures or increase our (per membership) revenues commensurate with the lowered growth rate such that our margins, liquidity and results of\noperation may be adversely impacted. If we are unable to successfully compete with current and new competitors in both retaining our existing memberships and\nattracting new memberships, our business will be adversely affected. Further, if excessive numbers of members cancel our service, we may be required to incur\nsignificantly higher marketing expenditures than we currently anticipate to replace these members with new members.\nChanges in competitive offerings for entertainment video, including the potential rapid adoption of piracy-based video offerings, could adversely impact\nour business.\nThe market for entertainment video is intense",

The various economic models underlying these channels include subscription, transactional, ad-supported and\npiracy-based models. All of these have the potential to capture meaningful segments of the entertainment video market. Piracy, in particular, threatens to damage\nour business, as its fundamental proposition to consumers is so compelling and difficult to compete against: virtually all content for free. Furthermore, in light of\nthe compelling consumer proposition, piracy services are subject to rapid global growth. Traditional providers of entertainment video, including broadcasters and\ncable network operators, as well as Internet based e-commerce or entertainment video providers are increasing their Internet-based video offerings. Several of these\ncompetitors have long operating histories, large customer bases, strong brand recognition and significant financial, marketing and other resources. They may secure\nbetter terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to product development, technology, infrastructure, content acquisitions and\nmarketing. New entrants may enter the market or existing providers may adjust their services with unique offerings or approaches to providing entertainment\nvideo. Companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions. If we are unable to successfully or profitably\ncompete with current and new competitors, our business will be adversely affected, and we may not be able to increase or maintain market share, revenues or\nprofitability.\n \nThe long-term and fixed cost nature of our content commitments may limit our operating flexibility and could adversely affect our liquidity and results of\noperations.\nIn connection with obtaining streaming content, we typically enter into multi-year commitments with studios and other content providers, the payment terms\nof which are not tied to member usage or the size of our membership base (“fixed cost”) but which may be tied to such factors as titles licensed and/or theatrical\nexhibition receipts.

Increased regulation of data utilization practices, including self-regulation or findings under existing laws that limit our ability to collect and use data, could\nhave an adverse effect on our business. In addition, if we were to disclose data about our members in a manner that was objectionable to them, our business\nreputation could be adversely affected, and we could face potential legal claims that could impact our operating results. As our business evolves and as we expand\ninternationally, we may become subject to additional and/or more stringent legal obligations concerning our treatment of customer and other personal information,\nsuch as laws regarding data localization and/or restrictions on data export. Failure to comply with these obligations could subject us to liability, and to the extent\nthat we need to alter our business model or practices to adapt to these obligations, we could incur additional expenses. For instance, in October 2015, the European\nCourt of Justice overturned the E.U./U.S. Safe Harbor Program, under which companies were able to transfer personal data from the E.U. to the U.S. in a legally\ncompliant manner. If other legally compliant forms of data transfer are similarly invalidated by courts or other authorities in the E.U., we may need to alter our\nbusiness practices, and which may adversely affect our business.\nOur reputation and relationships with members would be harmed if our membership data, particularly billing data, were to be accessed by unauthorized\npersons.\nWe maintain personal data regarding our members, including names and billing data.

For the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015, the impact from membership growth was slightly offset by a decrease in average monthly revenue per paying streaming membership resulting\nfrom unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations impacting our International streaming segment. This was partially offset by increases resulting from price changes\nand plan mix. The decrease in operating income for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 is due primarily to\nincreased marketing and headcount costs to support our international expansion in addition to increased content expenses as we continue to acquire, license and\nproduce content, including more Netflix originals. Net income is further impacted by the increase in interest expense associated with our debt issuance in the first\nquarter of 2015 as well as to an increase in losses on foreign currency denominated transactions.\nWe offer three types of streaming membership plans. In the U.S. our basic plan is priced at $7.99 per month and includes access to standard definition quality\nstreaming on a single screen at a time. Our most popular streaming plan is priced at $9.99 per month and includes access to high definition quality streaming on\ntwo screens concurrently. Our premium plan is priced at $11.99 per month and includes access to high definition and ultra-high definition quality content on four\nscreens concurrently. Internationally, the membership plans are structured similarly to the U.S. and range in price from the U.S. dollar equivalent of approximately\n$5.00 to $18.00 per month.\nWe expect that from time to time the prices of our membership plans in each country may change. For instance, in the second half of 2015, we increased the\nprice of our two-screen high definition plan in the U.S. and several European countries. In May 2014, in the U.S., we increased the price of our high definition plan\nfrom $7.99 per month to $8.99 per month with existing memberships grandfathered for a two year period. In October 2015, in the U.S., we increased the price of\nthis same high definition plan from $8.99 per month to $9.99 per month with existing memberships grandfathered for a one year period. In 2016, the grandfathered\npricing period will expire for a substantial number of U.S. memberships and the members will have the option of electing the basic streaming plan at $7.99 or\ncontinuing on the high definition plan at the higher price of $9.99.\nThe following represents the key elements to our segment results of operations:\n•\nWe define contribu",

The excess content payments over\nexpense is variable based on the payment terms of our content agreements and is expected to increase as we enter into more agreements with upfront cash\npayments, such as licensing and production of original content.

Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n27\n\n\nTable of Contents\nStreaming Content\nWe acquire, license and produce content, including original programming, in order to offer our members unlimited viewing of TV shows and films. The\ncontent licenses are for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability. Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more\nupfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense. Payments for content, including additions to streaming assets and the changes in related liabilities, are\nclassified within \"Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities\" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nFor licenses we capitalize the fee per title and record a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins, the cost of\nthe title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming. The portion available for streaming within one year is recognized as “Current content assets,\nnet” and the remaining portion as “Non-current content assets, net” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nFor productions we capitalize costs associated with the production, including development cost and direct costs. We include these amounts in \"Non-current\ncontent assets, net\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Participations and residuals are expensed in line with the amortization of production costs.\nBased on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns, we amortize the content assets (licensed and produced) in “Cost of revenues” on the\nConsolidated Statements of Operations, over the shorter of each title's contractual window of availability or estimated period of use, beginning with the month of\nfirst availability. The amortization period typically ranges from six months to five years. For most of our content, we amortize on a straight-line basis. For certain\ncontent where we expect more upfront viewing, due to the additional merchandising and marketing efforts, we amortize on an accelerated basis. We review factors\nthat impact the amortization of the content assets on a regular basis, including changes in merchandising and marketing efforts. Our estimates related to these\nfactors require considerable management judgment.  Changes in our estimates could have a significant impact on our future results of operations. In the third\nquarter of 2015, we changed the amortization method of certain content given changes in estimated viewing patterns of this content. The effect of this change in\nestimate was a $25.5 million increase in cost of revenues in the Domestic streaming segment, for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nContent assets are stated at the lower",

Accruals for\nestimated license fees are recorded and then adjusted based on any changes in estimates. These amounts are included in the streaming content obligations. The\nresults of these negotiations are uncertain and may be materially different from management's estimates.\nIncome Taxes\nWe record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations using the asset and liability method.\nDeferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying\namounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The effect on deferred tax assets\nand liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if\nnecessary, by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain. There was no valuation allowance as of December 31, 2015 or\n2014.\nAlthough we believe our assumptions, judgments and estimates are reasonable, changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of any\ntax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.\nIn evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, in full or in part, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our past\noperating results, and our forecast of future earnings, future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.

Due to uncertainties in any tax audit outcome, our estimates of the ultimate settlement of our unrecognized tax positions may change\nand the actual tax benefits may differ significantly from the estimates. See Note 10 of Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further\ninformation regarding income taxes.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe grant fully vested non-qualified stock options to our employees on a monthly basis. As a result of immediate vesting, stock-based compensation expense\nis fully recognized on the grant date, and no estimate is required for post-vesting option forfeitures. Stock-based compensation expense at the grant date is based on\nthe total number of options granted and an estimate of the fair value of the awards.\nWe calculate the fair value of our stock option grants using a lattice-binomial model. This model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions.\nChanges in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of options granted and our results of operations could be impacted.\n•\nExpected Volatility: Prior to January 1, 2015, our computation of expected volatility was based on a blend of historical volatility of our common stock\nand implied volatility of tradable forward call options to purchase shares of our common stock, as low trade volume of our tradable forward call options\nprior to 2011 precluded sole reliance on implied volatility. Beginning on January 1, 2015, expected volatility is based solely on implied volatility. We\nbelieve that implied volatility of publicly traded options in our common stock is more reflective of market conditions and, given consistently high trade\nvolumes of the options, can reasonably be expected to be a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility of our common stock. An\nincrease/decrease of 10% in our computation of expected volatility would increase/decrease the total stock-based compensation expense by\napproximately $10.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\n•\nSuboptimal Exercise Factor:  ",

Prior to\nJanuary 1, 2015, we bifurcated its option grants into two employee groupings (executive and non-executive) to determine the suboptimal exercise factor.\nBeginning on January 1, 2015, we began aggregating employee groupings for its determination of the suboptimal exercise factor as the previous\nbifurcation into two groupings did not have a material impact on the fair value of the options granted. An increase/decrease in the suboptimal exercise\nfactor of 10% would increase/decrease the total stock-based compensation expense by approximately $4.3 million for the year ended December 31,\n2015.\nItem 7A.\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nWe are exposed to market risks related to interest rate changes and the corresponding changes in the market values of our investments, debt and foreign\ncurrency fluctuations.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal, while at the same time maximizing income we receive from investments without\nsignificantly increased risk. To achieve this objective, we follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor and help mitigate our exposure\nto interest rate and credit risk. The policy sets forth credit quality standards and limits our exposure to any one issuer, as well as our maximum exposure to various\nasset classes. We maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and short-term investments in a variety of securities. These securities are classified as available-for-sale\nand are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, included in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” within Stockholders' equity in the\nConsolidated Balance Sheets.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015 , we had no impairment charges associated with our short-term investment portfolio. Although we believe our current\ninvestment portfolio has very little risk of material impairment, we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity and can provide no assurance that\nour investment portfolio will remain materially unimpaired. Some of the securities we invest in may be subject to market risk due to changes in prevailing interest\nrates which may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate. For example, if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then-\nprevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises, the value of our investment will decline. At December 31, 2015 , our cash equivalents were generally\ninvested in money market funds, which are not subject to market risk\n29\n\n\nTable of Contents\nbecause the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate.

As of December 31, 2014, a similar 100 basis point increase in the yield curve would have\nresulted in a $5.9 million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments\nprior to maturity.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $2.4 billion of debt, consisting of fixed rate unsecured debt in four tranches: $500.0 million of 5.375% notes due in 2021;\n$400.0 million of 5.750% notes due in 2024; $700.0 million of 5.50% notes due in 2022; and $800.0 million of 5.875% notes due in 2025. The fair value of our\ndebt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest.\nForeign Currency Risk\nInternational revenues and cost of revenues account for 29% and 39%, respectively of consolidated amounts for the year ended December 31, 2015. The\nmajority of international revenues and a smaller portion of expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and we therefore have foreign\ncurrency risk related to these currencies, which are primarily the euro, the British pound, the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar, the Japanese Yen and the\nBrazilian real.\nAccordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may negatively affect our revenue and\ncontribution profit (loss) of our International streaming segment as expressed in U.S. dollars.

We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the\npreparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial\nreporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of\nfinancial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of\nunauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.

(the “Company”) was incorporated on August 29, 1997 and began operations on April 14, 1998. The Company is the world’s leading Internet\ntelevision network with over 75 million streaming members in over 190 countries enjoying more than 125 million hours of hours of TV shows and movies per day,\nincluding original series, documentaries and feature films. Members can watch as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, on nearly any Internet-connected screen.\nMembers can play, pause and resume watching, all without commercials or commitments. Additionally, in the United States (\"U.S.\"), members can receive DVDs.\nThe Company has three reportable segments, Domestic streaming, International streaming and Domestic DVD. A majority of the Company’s revenues are\ngenerated in the United States, and substantially all of the Company’s long-lived tangible assets are held in the United States. The Company’s revenues are derived\nfrom monthly membership fees.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions have\nbeen eliminated.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of\nthe financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant items subject to such estimates and\nassumptions include the amortization policy for the streaming content assets; the recognition and measurement of income tax assets and liabilities; and the\nvaluation of stock-based compensation. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to\nbe reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nStock Split\nOn July 14, 2015, the Company completed a  seven -for-one stock split in the form of a stock dividend. References made to outstanding shares or per share\namounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and applicable disclosures have been retroactively adjusted to reflect this  seven -for-one stock\nsplit.

The number of authorized shares as reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets was not affected by the stock split and accordingly has not been adjusted.\nSee Note 8 for additional information.\nAccounting Guidance Adopted in 2015\nIn April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2015-05, Customer's Accounting for Fees\nPaid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement, which provides guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. If a\ncloud computing arrangement includes a software license, the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the\nacquisition of other software licenses. If the arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for a cloud computing arrangement as a\nservice contract. The Company elected to early adopt the ASU in the third quarter of 2015 and has applied the guidance prospectively to all arrangements. The\nimpact of the adoption of the ASU was not material to the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs which changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in\nfinancial statements. ASU 2015-03 requires an entity to present such costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an\nasset. Amortization of the costs will continue to be reported as interest expense. The Company elected to early adopt ASU 2015-03 as of December 31, 2015, and\nretrospectively reclassifed $14.2 million of debt issuance costs associated with the Company's long-term debt as of December 31, 2014 from other non-current\nassets to long-term debt.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes.\nThe amendments in this update require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The\nCompany has elected to early adopt ASU 2015-17 as\n43\n\n\nTable of Contents\nof December 31, 2015 and retrospectively applied ASU 2015-17 to all periods presented. As of December 31, 2014 the Company reclassified $13.4 million of\ndeferred tax assets from \"Other current assets\" to \"Other non-current assets\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nAccounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) which amended the existing accounting standards for\nrevenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 establishes principles for recognizing revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers, in an amount that\nreflects the expected consideration received in exchange for those goods or services. In July 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date for annual reporting\nperiods beginning after December 15, 2017 (including interim reporting p",

Early adoption is permitted to the original effective date of\nDecember 15, 2016 (including interim reporting periods within those periods). The amendments may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or\nretrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of initial application. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of\nadoption of the ASU on its consolidated financial statements, but does not expect the impact to be material.\nCash Equivalents and Short-term Investments\nThe Company considers investments in instruments purchased with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. The Company also\nclassifies amounts in transit from payment processors for customer credit card and debit card transactions as cash equivalents.\nThe Company classifies short-term investments, which consist of marketable securities with original maturities in excess of 90 days as available-for-sale.\nShort-term investments are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” within Stockholders’ equity\nin the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amortization of premiums and discounts on the investments, realized gains and losses, and declines in value judged to be\nother-than-temporary on available-for-sale securities are included in “Interest and other income (expense)” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The\nCompany uses the specific identification method to determine cost in calculating realized gains and losses upon the sale of short-term investments.\nShort-term investments are reviewed periodically to identify possible other-than-temporary impairment. When evaluating the investments, the Company\nreviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer, the Company’s intent to\nsell, or whether it would be more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell the investments before the recovery of their amortized cost basis.\nStreaming Content\nThe Company acquires, licenses and produces content, including original programming, in order to offer members unlimited viewing of TV shows and films.\nThe content licenses are for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability. Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more\nupfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense. Payments for content, including additions to streaming assets and the changes in related liabilities, are\nclassified within \"Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities\" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nFor licenses, the Company capitalizes the fee per title and records a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins,\nthe cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming.

These amounts are included in\n\"Non-current content assets, net\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Participations and residuals are expensed in line with the amortization of production costs.\nBased on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns, the Company amortizes the content assets (licensed and produced) in “Cost of revenues”\non the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the shorter of each title's contractual window of availability or estimated period of use, beginning with the\nmonth of first availability. The amortization period typically ranges from six months to five years. For most of the content, the Company amortizes on a straight-\nline basis. For certain content where the Company expects more upfront viewing, due to the additional merchandising and marketing efforts, the amortization is on\nan accelerated basis. The Company reviews factors impacting the amortization of the content assets on a regular basis, including changes in merchandising and\nmarketing efforts. The Company's estimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment.  Changes in estimates could have a significant\nimpact on the Company's future results of operations. In the third quarter of 2015, the Company changed the amortization method of certain content given changes\nin estimated viewing patterns of this content. The effect of this change in estimate was a $25.5 million decrease in\n44\n\n\nTable of Contents\noperating income and a $15.8 million decrease in net income for the year ended December 31, 2015. The effect on both basic earnings per share and diluted\nearnings per share was a decrease of $0.04 for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nContent assets are stated at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value which approximates fair value of the capitalized costs for produced content.\nContent assets are reviewed in aggregate at the operating segment level for write-down when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the\nexpected usefulness of the content. Unamortized costs for assets that have been or are expected to be abandoned are written off. No material write-down from\nunamortized cost to a lower net realizable value was recorded in any of the periods presented.\nThe Company has entered into certain licenses with collective management organizations (\"CMOs\"), and are currently involved in negotiations with other\nCMOs, that hold certain rights to music and other entertainment works \"publicly performed\" in connection with streaming content into various territories.

The\nresults of these negotiations are uncertain and may be materially different from management's estimates.\nDVD Content\nThe Company acquires DVD content for the purpose of renting such content to its domestic DVD members and earning membership rental revenues, and, as\nsuch, the Company considers its direct purchase DVD assets to be a productive asset. Accordingly, the Company classifies its DVD assets in “Non-current content\nassets, net” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The acquisition of DVD content assets, net of changes in related liabilities, is classified within cash used in\ninvesting activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows because the DVD content assets are considered a productive asset. Other companies in the in-\nhome entertainment video industry classify these cash flows as operating activities. The Company amortizes its direct purchase DVDs on an accelerated basis over\ntheir estimated useful lives, which range from one year to two years. The Company also obtains DVD content through revenue sharing agreements with studios and\nother content providers. Revenue sharing obligations are expensed as incurred based on shipments.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the\nestimated useful lives of the respective assets, generally up to 30 years , or the lease term for leasehold improvements, if applicable. Leased buildings are\ncapitalized and included in property and equipment when the Company was involved in the construction funding and did not meet the “sale-leaseback” criteria.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues are recognized ratably over each monthly membership period. Revenues are presented net of the taxes that are collected from members and\nremitted to governmental authorities. Deferred revenue consists of membership fees billed that have not been recognized and gift and other prepaid memberships\nthat have not been redeemed.\nMarketing\nMarketing expenses consist primarily of advertising expenses and also include payments made to the Company’s affiliates and consumer electronics\npartners. Advertising expenses include promotional activities such as digital and television advertising. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising\nexpenses were $714.3 million , $533.1 million and $404.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company records a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability\nmethod. Deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement\ncarrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforward",

The measurement of deferred tax assets is\nreduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain.\nThe Company did not recognize certain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes. The Company may recognize a tax\nbenefit only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.\nThe tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of\nbeing realized upon\n45\n\n\nTable of Contents\nsettlement. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial\nstatements for further information regarding income taxes.\nForeign Currency\nThe functional currency for the Company's subsidiaries is determined based on the primary economic environment in which the subsidiary operates. The\nCompany translates the assets and liabilities of its non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of\neach period. Revenues and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. Gains and losses from these\ntranslations are recognized in cumulative translation adjustment included in \"Accumulated other comprehensive loss\" in Stockholders’ equity on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheets.\nPrior to January 1, 2015, the functional currency of certain of the Company's European entities was the British pound. The Company changed the functional\ncurrency of these entities to the euro effective January 1, 2015 following the redomiciliation of the European headquarters and the launch of the Netflix service in\nseveral significant European countries. The change in functional currency was applied prospectively from January 1, 2015. Monetary assets and liabilities have\nbeen remeasured to the euro at current exchange rates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities have been remeasured to the euro using the exchange rate effective for\nthe period in which the balance arose. As a result of this change of functional currency, the Company recorded a $21.8 million cumulative translation adjustment\nincluded in other comprehensive loss for year ended December 31, 2015.\nThe Company remeasures monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency at exchange rates in effect at the end of each\nperiod. Gains and losses from these remeasurements are recognized in interest and other income (expense). Foreign currency transactions resulted in losses of\n$37.3 million , $8.2 million , and $8.4 million for the years ended December ",

Traditional film\noutput deals, like the U.S. output deal with Disney, or certain TV series license agreements where the number of seasons to be aired is unknown, are examples of\nsuch license agreements. The Company does not include any estimated obligation for these future titles beyond the known minimum amount. However, the\nunknown obligations are expected to be significant.\nLease obligations\nThe Company leases facilities under non-cancelable operating leases with various expiration dates through 2028. Several lease agreements contain rent\nescalation clauses or rent holidays. For purposes of recognizing minimum rental expenses on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases, the Company uses\nthe date of initial possession to begin amortization, which is generally when the Company enters the space and begins to make improvements in preparation for\nintended use. For scheduled rent escalation clauses during the lease terms or for rental payments commencing at a date other than the date of initial occupancy, the\nCompany records minimum rental expenses on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company has\nthe option to extend or renew most of its leases which may increase the future minimum lease commitments.\nBecause the terms of the Company’s facilities lease agreements for its original Los Gatos, California headquarters site required the Company’s involvement\nin the construction funding of the buildings, the Company is the “deemed owner” (for accounting purposes only) of these buildings. Accordingly, the Company\nrecorded an asset of $40.7 million , representing the total costs of the buildings and improvements, including the costs paid by the lessor (the legal owner of the\nbuildings), with corresponding liabilities. Upon completion of construction of each building, the Company did not meet the sale-leaseback criteria for de-\nrecognition of the building assets and liabilities. Therefore the leases are accounted for as financing obligations.\nIn the third quarter of 2015, the Company extended the facilities leases for the original Los Gatos buildings for an additional three years term, increasing the\nfuture minimum payments under the lease financing obligations by approximately $13.7 million . In this extension, the leases continue to be accounted for as\nfinancing obligations and no gain or loss was recorded as a result of the lease financing modification. At December 31, 2015, the lease financing obligation balance\nwas $29.0 million , the majority of which is recorded in “Other non-current liabilities,” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Beginning on January 1, 2015, expected volatility is based\nsolely on implied volatility. The Company believes that implied volatility of publicly traded options in its common stock is more reflective of market conditions,\nand given consistently high trade volumes of the options, can reasonably be expected to be a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility of its\ncommon stock.\nIn valuing shares issued under the Company’s employee stock option plans, the Company bases the risk-free interest rate on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon\nissues with terms similar to the contractual term of the options. The Company does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore\nuses an expected dividend yield of  zero  in the option valuation model. The Company does not use a post-vesting termination rate as options are fully vested upon\ngrant date.\n9.

Our ability to continue to attract members will depend in part on our ability\nto consistently provide our members with compelling content choices, as well as a quality experience for selecting and viewing TV shows and movies.\nFurthermore, the relative service levels, content offerings, pricing and related features of competitors to our service may adversely impact our ability to attract and\nretain memberships. Competitors include other entertainment video providers, such as MVPDs, Internet-based movie and TV content providers (including those\nthat provide pirated content) and DVD rental outlets. If consumers do not perceive our service offering to be of value, including if we introduce new or adjust\nexisting features, adjust pricing or service offerings, or change the mix of content in a manner that is not favorably received by them, we may not be able to attract\nand retain members. In addition, many of our members are rejoining our service or originate from word-of-mouth advertising from existing members. If our efforts\nto satisfy our existing members are not successful, we may not be able to attract members, and as a result, our ability to maintain and/or grow our business will be\nadversely affected. Members cancel our service for many reasons, including a perception that they do not use the service sufficiently, the need to cut household\nexpenses, availability of content is unsatisfactory, competitive services provide a better value or experience and customer service issues are not satisfactorily\nresolved. We must continually add new memberships both to replace canceled memberships and to grow our business beyond our current membership base. If\ngrowth rates slow faster than expected, given, in particular that our content costs are largely fixed in nature and contracted over several years, we may not be able\nto adjust our expenditures or increase our (per membership) revenues commensurate with the lowered growth rate such that our margins, liquidity and results of\noperation may be adversely impacted.

For the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015, the impact from membership growth was slightly offset by a decrease in average monthly revenue per paying streaming membership resulting\nfrom unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations impacting our International streaming segment. This was partially offset by increases resulting from price changes\nand plan mix. The decrease in operating income for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 is due primarily to\nincreased marketing and headcount costs to support our international expansion in addition to increased content expenses as we continue to acquire, license and\nproduce content, including more Netflix originals. Net income is further impacted by the increase in interest expense associated with our debt issuance in the first\nquarter of 2015 as well as to an increase in losses on foreign currency denominated transactions.\nWe offer three types of streaming membership plans. In the U.S. our basic plan is priced at $7.99 per month and includes access to standard definition quality\nstreaming on a single screen at a time. Our most popular streaming plan is priced at $9.99 per month and includes access to high definition quality streaming on\ntwo screens concurrently. Our premium plan is priced at $11.99 per month and includes access to high definition and ultra-high definition quality content on four\nscreens concurrently. Internationally, the membership plans are structured similarly to the U.S. and range in price from the U.S. dollar equivalent of approximately\n$5.00 to $18.00 per month.\nWe expect that from time to time the prices of our membership plans in each country may change. For instance, in the second half of 2015, we increased the\nprice of our two-screen high definition plan in the U.S. and several European countries. In May 2014, in the U.S., we increased the price of our high definition plan\nfrom $7.99 per month to $8.99 per month with existing memberships grandfathered for a two year period. In October 2015, in the U.S., we increased the price of\nthis same high definition plan from $8.99 per month to $9.99 per month with existing memberships grandfathered for a one year period. In 2016, the grandfathered\npricing period will expire for a substantial number of U.S. memberships and the members will have the option of electing the basic streaming plan at $7.99 or\ncontinuing on the high definition plan at the higher price of $9.99.\nThe following represents the key elements to our segment results of operations:\n•\nWe define contribu",

For the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015, the impact from membership growth was slightly offset by a decrease in average monthly revenue per paying streaming membership resulting\nfrom unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations impacting our International streaming segment. This was partially offset by increases resulting from price changes\nand plan mix. The decrease in operating income for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 is due primarily to\nincreased marketing and headcount costs to support our international expansion in addition to increased content expenses as we continue to acquire, license and\nproduce content, including more Netflix originals. Net income is further impacted by the increase in interest expense associated with our debt issuance in the first\nquarter of 2015 as well as to an increase in losses on foreign currency denominated transactions.\nWe offer three types of streaming membership plans. In the U.S. our basic plan is priced at $7.99 per month and includes access to standard definition quality\nstreaming on a single screen at a time. Our most popular streaming plan is priced at $9.99 per month and includes access to high definition quality streaming on\ntwo screens concurrently. Our premium plan is priced at $11.99 per month and includes access to high definition and ultra-high definition quality content on four\nscreens concurrently. Internationally, the membership plans are structured similarly to the U.S. and range in price from the U.S. dollar equivalent of approximately\n$5.00 to $18.00 per month.\nWe expect that from time to time the prices of our membership plans in each country may change. For instance, in the second half of 2015, we increased the\nprice of our two-screen high definition plan in the U.S. and several European countries. In May 2014, in the U.S., we increased the price of our high definition plan\nfrom $7.99 per month to $8.99 per month with existing memberships grandfathered for a two year period. In October 2015, in the U.S., we increased the price of\nthis same high definition plan from $8.99 per month to $9.99 per month with existing memberships grandfathered for a one year period.

The\nresults of these negotiations are uncertain and may be materially different from management's estimates.\nDVD Content\nThe Company acquires DVD content for the purpose of renting such content to its domestic DVD members and earning membership rental revenues, and, as\nsuch, the Company considers its direct purchase DVD assets to be a productive asset. Accordingly, the Company classifies its DVD assets in “Non-current content\nassets, net” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The acquisition of DVD content assets, net of changes in related liabilities, is classified within cash used in\ninvesting activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows because the DVD content assets are considered a productive asset. Other companies in the in-\nhome entertainment video industry classify these cash flows as operating activities. The Company amortizes its direct purchase DVDs on an accelerated basis over\ntheir estimated useful lives, which range from one year to two years. The Company also obtains DVD content through revenue sharing agreements with studios and\nother content providers. Revenue sharing obligations are expensed as incurred based on shipments.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the\nestimated useful lives of the respective assets, generally up to 30 years , or the lease term for leasehold improvements, if applicable. Leased buildings are\ncapitalized and included in property and equipment when the Company was involved in the construction funding and did not meet the “sale-leaseback” criteria.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues are recognized ratably over each monthly membership period. Revenues are presented net of the taxes that are collected from members and\nremitted to governmental authorities. Deferred revenue consists of membership fees billed that have not been recognized and gift and other prepaid memberships\nthat have not been redeemed.\nMarketing\nMarketing expenses consist primarily of advertising expenses and also include payments made to the Company’s affiliates and consumer electronics\npartners. Advertising expenses include promotional activities such as digital and television advertising. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising\nexpenses were $714.3 million , $533.1 million and $404.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company records a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability\nmethod. Deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement\ncarrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforward",

As of December 31, 2014, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $34.8 million , of which  $29.2 million , if recognized, would favorably\nimpact the Company’s effective tax rate. The aggregate changes in the Company’s total gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits are summarized as follows (in\nthousands):\n \nBalance as of December 31, 2013\n$\n68,231\nDecreases related to tax positions taken during prior periods\n(39,015)\nIncreases related to tax positions taken during the current period\n11,174\nDecreases related to settlements with taxing authorities\n(5,578)\nBalance as of December 31, 2014\n$\n34,812\n Increases related to tax positions taken during prior periods\n1,960\n Decreases related to tax positions taken during prior periods\n(12,334)\n Increases related to tax positions taken during the current period\n7,077\n Decreases related to settlements with taxing authorities\n(14,398)\nBalance as of December 31, 2015\n$\n17,117\n57\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe Company includes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes and in “Other non-current liabilities”\nin the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Interest and penalties included in the Company's provision for income taxes were not material in all the periods presented.\nThe Company files U.S. Federal, state and foreign tax returns. In December 2015, the Company reached a settlement with the IRS for tax years 2010 through\n2013. The 2014 Federal tax return remains subject to examination by the IRS. California had previously completed its Field Exam of the 2006 and 2007 California\ntax returns and had issued a Notice of Proposed Assessment primarily related to the Company's R&D Credits claimed in those years. The Company filed a protest\nagainst the proposed assessment and settlement was reached with the Franchise Tax Board for tax years 1997 through 2007 in November 2015. The years 2008\nthrough 2014, remain subject to examination by the state of California. As a result of the above audit settlements, the Company has reassessed the tax reserves on\nthe related uncertain tax position for all open years and released $13.4 million of tax reserves in the fourth quarter of 2015. The Company has no significant foreign\njurisdiction audits underway. The years 2011 through 2014 remain subject to examination by foreign jurisdictions.\nGiven the potential outcome of the current examinations as well as the impact of the current examinations on the potential expiration of the statute of\nlimitations, it is reasonably possible that the balance of unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change within the next twelve months. However, an estimate\nof the range of reasonably possible adjustments cannot be made.\n11.\nEmployee Benefit Plan\nThe Company maintains a 401(k) savings plan covering substantially all of its employees. Eligible employees may contribute up to 60% of their annual\nsalary through payroll deductions, but not more than the statutory l",

What information we have gathered\n2. Whether it is sufficient to answer the question\n3. If not sufficient, what specific information is missing\n4. If sufficient, how we would calculate or derive the answer\n5. If there are conflicting answers:\n--> Use citations to select the correct answer if there are conflicting answers.\n\nBe brief and concise. No need for structured output - just think through the steps. You MUST respond in markdown format (for $ signs make sure to use escape character \\ before the $ sign).\n",
      "output": "### Analysis\n\n1. **Information Gathered:**\n   - **Unadjusted Operating Income:** Multiple outputs suggest that the unadjusted operating income for FY2015 is \\$305,826, as found in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n   - **Depreciation and Amortization (D&A) Expenses:** The D&A expenses for FY2015 are reported as \\$62,283, found in the statement of cash flows under the 'Adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash (used in) provided by operating activities' section.\n   - **Total Revenue:** The total revenue for FY2015 is consistently reported as \\$6,779,511, found in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\n2. **Sufficiency of Information:**\n   - The information gathered is sufficient to calculate the unadjusted EBITDA % margin for FY2015. We have the necessary components: unadjusted operating income, D&A expenses, and total revenue.\n\n3. **Calculation:**\n   - **Unadjusted EBITDA:** This is calculated by adding the unadjusted operating income and the D&A expenses:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Unadjusted EBITDA} = \\$305,826 + \\$62,283 = \\$368,109\n     \\]\n   - **EBITDA % Margin:** This is calculated by dividing the unadjusted EBITDA by the total revenue and multiplying by 100 to express it as a percentage:\n     \\[\n     \\text{EBITDA \\% Margin} = \\left(\\frac{\\$368,109}{\\$6,779,511}\\right) \\times 100 \\approx 5.43\\%\n     \\]\n\n4. **Conflicting Answers:**\n   - There are no significant conflicting answers for the key figures needed for the calculation. The citations consistently point to the same figures for operating income, D&A expenses, and total revenue.\n\nIn conclusion, we have sufficient and consistent information to calculate the FY2015 unadjusted EBITDA % margin for Netflix, which is approximately 5.43%."
