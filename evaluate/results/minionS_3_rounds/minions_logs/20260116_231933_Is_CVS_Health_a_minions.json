Total length: 856622 characters.: \n\n## Question\nIs CVS Health a capital-intensive business based on FY2022 data?\n\n---\n\nPlease provide succinct advice on the critical information we need to extract from the Financial document. Total length: 856622 characters to answer this question. \n\nAlso consider the following constraints:\n- In your response do NOT use numbered lists.\n- Do NOT structure your response as a sequence of steps.\n",
      "output": "To determine if CVS Health is a capital-intensive business based on FY2022 data, focus on extracting information related to capital expenditures, depreciation, and asset base. Look for details on the company's investment in property, plant, and equipment, as well as any significant investments in technology or infrastructure. Analyze the balance sheet for the proportion of fixed assets relative to total assets, and review the cash flow statement for capital expenditure figures. Additionally, consider the industry context by comparing CVS Health's capital intensity with industry averages or competitors. This will help assess whether CVS Health requires substantial capital investment to maintain and grow its operations."

      "prompt": "# Decomposition Round #1\n\nYou (the supervisor) cannot directly read the document(s). Instead, you can assign small, isolated tasks to a less capable worker model that sees only a single chunk of text at a time. Any cross-chunk or multi-document reasoning must be handled by you.\n\n## Your Job: Write Two Python Functions\n\n### FUNCTION #1: `prepare_jobs(context, prev_job_manifests, prev_job_outputs) -> List[JobManifest]`\n- Break the document(s) into chunks (using the provided chunking function, if needed). Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 12 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`. All **multi-chunk integration** or **global reasoning** is your responsibility here.\n- Return one **aggregated string** suitable for further supervisor inspection.\n\n\n\n## Relevant Pydantic Models\n\nThe following models are already in the global scope. **Do NOT redefine or re-import them.**\n\n### JobManifest Model\n```\nclass JobManifest(BaseModel):\n    chunk: str  # the actual text for the chunk of the document\n    task: str  # the actual task instruction for the small model\n    advice: str  # optional, any additional advice on how to perform the task\n\n    chunk_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    task_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    job_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n\n```\n\n### JobOutput Model\n```\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    citation: Optional[str]\n    answer: Optional[str]\n\n```\n\n## Function Signatures\n```\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        context (List[str]): A list of documents.

New entrants into the\nmarketplace, as well as consolidation within the industry, have contributed to and are expected to intensify the competitive environment. In addition, the rapid\npace of change as the industry evolves towards a consumer-focused retail marketplace, including Insurance Exchanges, and the increased use of technology to\ninteract with members, providers and customers, increase the risks the Company faces from new entrants and disruptive actions by existing competitors\ncompared to prior periods.\nThe Company believes that the significant factors that distinguish competing health plans include the perceived overall quality (including accreditation\nstatus), quality of service, comprehensiveness of coverage, cost (including premium rates, provider discounts and member out-of-pocket costs), product\ndesign, financial stability and ratings, breadth and quality of provider networks, ability to offer different provider network options, providers available in such\nnetworks, and quality of member support and care management programs. The Company believes that it is competitive on each of these factors. The\nCompany’s ability to increase the number of persons covered by its health plans or to increase Health Care Benefits segment revenues is affected by its ability\nto differentiate itself from its competitors on these factors.

The Biden administration most recently renewed\nthe PHE on January 11, 2023 and has indicated that they intend for the PHE to expire on May 11, 2023. The Families First Coronavirus Response Act (the\n“Families First Act”) and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) were enacted in March 2020. Each of the Families First\nAct and the CARES Act requires the Company to provide coverage for COVID-19 related medical services, in many cases without member cost-sharing, in its\nInsured Health Care Benefits products.\nThe CARES Act also provides relief funding to providers to reimburse them for health care related expenses incurred in preventing, preparing for and/or\nresponding to COVID-19 (provided no other source is obligated to reimburse those expenses) or lost health care related revenues that are attributable to\nCOVID-19. Under the CARES Act, the Company receives reimbursement for uninsured patients in connection with COVID-19 testing and vaccination as well\nas monoclonal antibody treatment. Aside from such reimbursement, the Company has not requested any funding under the CARES Act. However, in the\nsecond quarter of 2020, the Company received $43 million from the CARES Act provider relief fund, all of which was returned to the HHS during the second\nquarter of 2020.\nThe CARES Act also allows for the deferral of the payment of the employer share of Social Security taxes effective March 27, 2020 by permitting them to\nremit the associated payments in two equal installments on or about December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2022.

These governmental actions included, but were not limited to, requirements to waive member cost-sharing associated with COVID-\n19 testing and treatment, provide coverage for additional COVID-19-related services, expand the use of telemedicine, extend grace periods for payments of\npremiums or limit coverage termination based on non-payment of premiums or fees, modify health benefits coverage eligibility rules to help maintain\nemployee eligibility, and facilitate, accelerate or advance payments to providers, and other requirements related to the PHE.

Several of these are subject to judicial challenges. We are continuing to closely monitor and update\nour practices in response to developments or changes in the COVID-19 vaccination policies established by various federal agencies as well as the several state-\nand municipal-specific COVID-19 vaccine mandates that provide expanded exemptions, modifications, requirements or restrictions regarding employee\nvaccinations.

Employees must apply and be approved for a reasonable accommodation in order to\nbe exempt from the vaccination requirement.\nAdditionally, in January 2022, the HHS announced that commercial health insurers must cover the costs of up to eight rapid COVID-19 OTC test kits per\nindividual per 30-day period. Coverage for COVID-19 OTC test kits has subsequently been required by Medicare and, in many states, Medicaid. These\nrequirements may increase benefit costs in those businesses and jurisdictions, and may increase revenues in our retail business.

Potential sanctions for violating these\nlaws include recoupment or reduction of government reimbursement amounts, civil penalties, treble damages, and exclusion from participation in government\nhealth care programs. Such laws include the federal False Claims Act (the “False Claims Act”), the federal anti-kickback statute (the “AKS”), state false claims\nacts and anti-kickback statutes in most states, the federal “Stark Law” and related state laws. In particular, the False Claims Act prohibits intentionally\nsubmitting, conspiring to submit, or causing to be submitted, false claims, records, or statements to the federal government, or intentionally failing to return\noverpayments, in connection with reimbursement by federal government programs. In addition, any claim for government reimbursement also violates the\nFalse Claims Act where it results from a violation of the AKS.\nBoth federal and state false claims laws permit private individuals to file qui tam or “whistleblower” lawsuits on behalf of the federal or state government.\nParticipants in the health and related benefits industry, including the Company, frequently are subject to actions under the False Claims Act or similar state\nlaws. The federal Stark Law generally prohibits physicians from referring Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries for certain services, including outpatient\nprescription drugs, to any entity with which the physician, or an immediate family member of the physician, has a financial relationship. The Stark Law further\nprohibits the entity receiving a prohibited referral from presenting a claim for reimbursement by Medicare or Medicaid for services furnished pursuant to the\nprohibited referral.

Even though the ACA was deemed constitutional, there may nevertheless be\ncontinued efforts to invalidate, modify, repeal or replace portions of it.

If a Medicare Advantage or Medicare Part D contract pays minimum MLR rebates for three consecutive years, it will become ineligible to\nenroll new members. If a Medicare Advantage or Medicare Part D contract pays such rebates for five consecutive years, it will be terminated by CMS. Due to\npotential lower utilization of medical services by Medicare beneficiaries during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is possible certain Medicare Advantage contracts\nmay not meet the 85% MLR for consecutive years.\nThe Company’s Medicare Advantage and PDP products are heavily regulated by CMS. The regulations and contractual requirements applicable to the\nCompany and other private participants in Medicare programs are complex, expensive to comply with and subject to change. For example, the Medicare\nAdvantage Overpayment Rule, issued in 2014, implemented the ACA requirements that Medicare Advantage and PDP plans report and refund to CMS\noverpayments that those plans receive from CMS. Failure to notify overpayments to CMS could result in liability under the False Claims Act. The precise\ninterpretation, impact and legality of this rule are subject to pending litigation. Payments the Company receives from CMS for its Medicare Advantage and Part\nD businesses also are subject to risk adjustment based on the health status of the individuals enrolled. Elements of that risk adjustment mechanism continue to\nbe challenged by the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”), the Office of the Inspector General of the HHS (the “OIG”) and CMS itself.

The new safe harbors are (i) for rebates which are passed on to\nthe patient at the point of sale and (ii) for flat service fee payments made to PBMs which cannot be tied to the list prices of drugs. It is unclear whether the\nRebate Rule will be enforceable, whether pharmaceutical companies will respond by reducing list prices, whether list prices in the private market may also be\nreduced, and what the resulting impact will be to PBMs or the Company. The Pharmaceutical Care Management Association (the “PCMA”), which represents\nPBMs, has filed a suit in an effort to block the Rebate Rule, claiming that the Rebate Rule would lead to higher premiums in Medicare Part D and was adopted\nin an unlawful manner. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Act of 2021 delays the effective date of the rebate rule to January 2026, and the Inflation Reduction Act,\nenacted in August 2022, further delays the Rebate Rule through 2032.\nIn July 2022, the 2% Medicare sequester required by the Budget Control Act of 2011 resumed, meaning that Medicare claims incur a 2% reduction in Medicare\npayment.

It is also possible that Congress may\nconsider changes to Medicare Advantage payment policies due to recent recommendations by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission and to reduce the\npotential added cost burden of costly new benefits, or policies that impact drug pricing such as price controls and inflationary rebates applied to pharmaceutical\nmanufacturers.\nIt is not possible to predict the outcome of such regulatory or Congressional activity, any of which could materially and adversely affect the Company.\nMedicare Audits - CMS regularly audits the Company’s performance to determine its compliance with CMS’s regulations and its contracts with CMS and to\nassess the quality of services it provides to Medicare Advantage and PDP beneficiaries.

The Company also has received Civil\nInvestigative Demands (“CIDs”) from, and provided documents and information to, the Civil Division of the DOJ in connection with a current investigation of\nits patient chart review processes in connection with risk adjustment data submissions under Parts C and D of the Medicare program.\nOn January 30, 2023, CMS released the final rule concerning Part C contract-level Risk Adjustment Data Validation Audits (the “RADV Audit Rule”). The\nRADV Audit Rule eliminated the application of a fee-for-service adjuster (“FFS Adjuster”) in contract-level RADV audits but continued the use of\nextrapolation in such audits of Medicare Advantage organizations. The FFS Adjuster that was announced in 2012 was to be used by CMS to determine a\npermissible level of payment error. By applying the FFS Adjuster, Medicare Advantage organizations would have been liable for repayments only to the extent\nthat their extrapolated payment errors exceeded the error rate in Original Medicare, which could have impacted the extrapolated repayments to which Medicare\nAdvantage organizations are subject. Under the RADV Audit Rule, CMS, in most cases, will conduct RADV audits for payment year 2018 and subsequent\npayment years using extrapolation without the application of a FFS Adjuster. The RADV Audit Rule may have potential adverse effects, which could be\nmaterial, on the Company’s operating results, financial condition, and cash flows. CMS also has announced that it will not conduct RADV audits on all\ncontracts; instead, it will only audit contracts it believes are at the highest risk for overpayments based on its statistical modeling.\nMedicare Star Ratings - A portion of each Medicare Advantage plan’s reimbursement is tied to the plan’s “star ratings.” The star rating system considers a\nvariety of measures adopted by CMS, including quality of preventative services, chronic illness management, compliance and overall customer satisfaction.\nOnly Medicare Advantage plans with an overall star rating of 4 or more stars (out of 5 stars) are eligible for a quality bonus in their basic premium rates. As a\nresult, the Company’s Medicare Advantage plans’ operating results in 2023 and going forward will be significantly affected by their star ratings. The\nCompany’s star ratings and past performance scores are adversely affected by any compliance issues that may have arisen each year in its Medicare operations.\nCMS released the Company’s 2023 star ratings in October 2022. The Company’s 2023 star ratings will be used to determine which of its Medicare Advantage\nplans have ratings of 4 stars or higher and qualify for bonu",

Based on the 2023 star ratings, the percentage of the Company’s Medicare\nAdvantage members in 4 or more stars plans is expected to drop to 21% (based on enrollment and contract affiliation at December 31, 2022), as compared to\n87%\n21\n\n\nbased on the 2022 star ratings. The main driver of this decrease was a 1 star decrease in the Company’s Aetna National PPO, which dropped from 4.5 to 3.5\nstars, while many of the Company’s other plans remain rated at 4 or more stars. The decrease in the star rating for the Aetna National PPO will mean that it will\nno longer be eligible for CMS’ quality bonus payments related to 2024, though the Company’s contract diversification efforts, which will partially mitigate\ncertain adverse impacts associated with the decrease in the star rating for the Aetna National PPO, have received regulatory approval. CMS also gives PDPs\nstar ratings that affect each PDP’s enrollment. Medicare Advantage and PDP plans that are rated less than 3 stars for three consecutive years are subject to\ncontract termination by CMS. CMS continues to revise its star ratings system to make it harder to achieve 4 or more stars. There can be no assurances that the\nCompany will be successful in maintaining or improving its star ratings in future years. Accordingly, the Company’s Medicare Advantage plans may not\ncontinue to be or become eligible for full level quality bonuses, which could adversely affect the benefits such plans can offer, reduce membership and/or\nreduce profit margins.\nMedicare Payment Rates - In April 2022, CMS issued its final notice detailing final 2023 Medicare Advantage payment rates. Final 2023 Medicare\nAdvantage rates resulted in an expected average increase in revenue for the Medicare Advantage industry of 5.00%, excluding the CMS estimate of Medicare\nAdvantage risk score trend. On February 1, 2023, CMS issued an advance notice detailing proposed 2024 Medicare Advantage payment rates. The 2024\nMedicare Advantage rates, if finalized as proposed, will result in an expected average decrease in revenue for the Medicare Advantage industry of 2.27%,\nexcluding the CMS estimate of Medicare Advantage risk score trend. CMS intends to publish the final 2024 rate announcement no later than April 3, 2023. The\nfederal government may seek to impose restrictions on the configuration of pharmacy or other provider networks for Medicare Advantage and/or PDP plans, or\notherwise restrict the ability of these plans to alter benefits, negotiate prices or establish other terms to improve affordability or maintain viability of products.\nThe Company currently believes that the payments it has received and will receive in the near term are adequate to justify the Company’s continued\nparticipation in the Medicare Advantage and PDP programs, although there are economic and political pressures to continue to reduce spending on the\nprogram, and this outlook could change.\n340B Drug Pricing Program – The 340B Drug Prici",

In 2020, a number of pharmaceutical manufacturers\nbegan programs that limited Covered Entities’ participation in the program through contract pharmacies arrangements. In May 2021, HRSA sent enforcement\nletters to multiple manufacturers to curb these practices. In September 2021, HRSA forwarded the enforcement actions to the OIG for potential imposition of\ncivil monetary penalties. Those enforcement actions are currently subject to ongoing litigation. In November 2022, HRSA issued proposed rules that would\noverhaul the 340B Drug Pricing Programs Administrative Dispute Resolution process. The revisions are designed to make the process more accessible by\nmaking it more expeditious and less formal, as well as more equitable by requiring fewer resources to participate. A reduction in Covered Entities’ participation\nin contract pharmacy arrangements, as a result of the pending enforcement actions or otherwise, a reduction in the use of the Company’s administrative\nservices by Covered Entities, or a reduction in drug manufacturers’ participation in the program could materially and adversely affect the Company.\nAnti-Remuneration Laws - Federal law prohibits, among other things, an entity from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving, subject\nto certain exceptions and “safe harbors,” any remuneration to induce the referral of individuals or the purchase, lease or order of items or services for which\npayment may be made under Medicare, Medicaid or certain other federal and state health care programs. A number of states have similar laws, some of which\nare not limited to services paid for with government funds. Sanctions for violating these federal and state anti-remuneration laws may include imprisonment,\ncriminal and civil fines, and exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state government-sponsored health care programs.\nCompanies involved in public health care programs such as Medicare and/or Medicaid are required to maintain compliance programs to detect and deter fraud,\nwaste and abuse, and are often the subject of fraud, waste and abuse investigations and audits. The Company has invested significant resources to comply with\nMedicare and Medicaid program standards. Ongoing vigorous law enforcement and the highly technical regulatory scheme mean that the Company’s\ncompliance efforts in this area will continue to require significant resources.\nAntitrust and Unfair Competition - The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) investigates and prosecutes practices that are “unfair trade practices” or\n“unfair methods of competition.” Numerous lawsuits have been filed throughout the United States against pharmaceutical manufacturers, retail pharmacies\nand/or PBMs under various federal a",

In addition to PII, the Company uses and discloses de-identified data for analytical\nand other purposes when permitted. Additionally, there are industry standards for handling credit card data known as the Payment Card Industry Data Security\nStandard, which are a set of requirements designed to help ensure that entities that process, store or transmit credit card information maintain a secure\nenvironment. Certain states have incorporated these requirements into state laws or enacted other requirements relating to the use and/or disclosure of PII.\nThe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and the regulations issued thereunder (collectively, “HIPAA”), as further modified by\nthe American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (“ARRA”) impose extensive requirements on the way in which health plans, providers, health care\nclearinghouses (known as “covered entities”) and their business associates use, disclose and safeguard protected health information (“PHI”). Further, ARRA\nrequires the Company and other covered entities to report any breaches of PHI to impacted individuals and to the HHS and to notify the media in any states\nwhere 500 or more people are impacted by the unauthorized release or use of or access to PHI. Criminal penalties and civil sanctions may be imposed for\nfailing to comply with HIPAA standards.

The HITECH Act also extended HIPAA privacy and security requirements and penalties directly to business associates. HHS has begun to audit health\nplans, providers and other parties to enforce HIPAA compliance, including with respect to data security.\nIn addition to HIPAA, state health privacy laws apply to the extent they are more protective of individual privacy than is HIPAA, including laws that place\nstricter controls on the release of information relating to specific diseases or conditions and requirements to notify members of unauthorized release or use of or\naccess to PHI. States also have adopted regulations to implement provisions of the Financial Modernization Act of 1999 (also known as the Gramm-Leach-\nBliley Act (“GLBA”)) which generally require insurers, including health insurers, to provide customers with notice regarding how their non-public personal\nhealth and financial information is used and the opportunity to “opt out” of certain disclosures before the insurer shares such information with a non-affiliated\nthird party. Like HIPAA, GLBA sets a “floor” standard, allowing states to adopt more stringent requirements governing privacy protection. Complying with\nadditional state requirements requires us to make additional investments beyond those the Company has made to comply with HIPAA and GLBA.\nThe Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 encourages organizations to share cyber threat indicators with the federal government and, among other\nthings, directs HHS to develop a set of voluntary cybersecurity best practices for organizations in the health care industry. In addition, states have begun to\nenact more comprehensive privacy laws and regulations addressing consumer rights to data access, deletion, protection or transparency, such as the California\nConsumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”). States also are starting to issue regulations and proposed regulations specifically related to cybersecurity, such as the\nregulations issued by the New York Department of Financial Services. Complying with conflicting cybersecurity regulations, which may differ from state to\nstate, requires significant resources. In addition, differing approaches to state privacy and/or cyber-security regulation and varying enforcement philosophies\nmay materially and adversely affect the Company’s ability to standardize its products and services across state lines. Widely-reported large scale commercial\ndata breaches in the United States and abroad increase the likelihood that additional data security legislation will be considered by additional states.

These standards may differ from, and be\nmore stringent than, HIPAA.\nConsumer Protection Laws - The federal government has many consumer protection laws, such as the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Federal Postal\nService Act and the Consumer Product Safety Act. Most states also have similar consumer protection laws and a growing number of states regulate subscription\nprograms. In addition, the federal government and most states have adopted laws and/or regulations requiring places of public accommodation, health care\nservices and other goods and\n23\n\n\nservices to be accessible to people with disabilities. These consumer protection and accessibility laws and regulations have been the basis for investigations,\nlawsuits and multistate settlements relating to, among other matters, the marketing of loyalty programs, and health care products and services, pricing accuracy,\nexpired front store products, financial incentives provided by drug manufacturers to pharmacies in connection with therapeutic interchange programs,\ndisclosures related to how personal data is used and protected and the accessibility of goods and services to people with disabilities. As a result of the\nCompany’s direct-to-consumer activities, including mobile and web-based solutions offered to members and to other consumers, the Company also is subject\nto federal and state regulations applicable to electronic communications and to other general consumer protection laws and regulations.

These contracts with the OPM and applicable government regulations establish\npremium rating arrangements for this program. In addition to other requirements, such as the Transparency in Coverage Rule note above, OPM regulations\nrequire that community-rated FEHB plans meet a FEHB program-specific minimum MLR by plan code and market. Managing to these rules is complicated by\nthe simultaneous application of the minimum MLR standards and associated premium rebate requirements of the ACA. The Company also has a contractual\narrangement with carriers for the FEHB program, such as the BlueCross BlueShield Association, to provide pharmacy services to federal employees, postal\nworkers, annuitants, and their dependents under the Government-wide Service Benefit Plan, as authorized by the FEHB Act and as part of the FEHB program.\nAdditionally, the Company manages certain FEHB plans on a “cost-plus” basis.

The Company has taken steps to be able to continue to serve customers in the European Economic Area following the\nUnited Kingdom’s exit from the EU (“Brexit”).\nThe Company’s international operations are subject to different, and sometimes more stringent, legal and regulatory requirements, which vary widely by\njurisdiction, including anti-corruption laws; economic sanctions laws; various privacy, insurance, tax, tariff and trade laws and regulations; corporate\ngovernance, privacy, data protection (including the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation which began to apply across the EU during 2018), data mining,\ndata transfer, labor and employment, intellectual property, consumer protection and investment laws and regulations; discriminatory licensing procedures;\ncompulsory cessions of reinsurance; required localization of records and funds; higher premium and income taxes; limitations on dividends and repatriation of\ncapital; and requirements for local participation in an insurer’s ownership. In addition, the presence of operations in foreign countries potentially increases the\nCompany’s exposure to the anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-money laundering provisions of U.S. law, including the FCPA, and corresponding foreign\nlaws, including the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 (the “UK Bribery Act”).\nAnti-Corruption Laws - The FCPA prohibits offering, promising or authorizing others to give anything of value to a foreign government official to obtain or\nretain business or otherwise secure a business advantage. The Company also is subject to applicable anti-corruption laws of the jurisdictions in which it\noperates. In many countries outside the United States, health care professionals are employed by the government. Therefore, the Company’s dealings with them\nare subject to regulation under the FCPA. Violations of the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions as well as\nother penalties, and there continues to be a heightened level of FCPA enforcement activity by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and\nthe DOJ. The UK Bribery Act is an anti-corruption law that is broader in scope than the FCPA and applies to all companies with a nexus to the United\nKingdom.

In general, these limitations apply to certain customer\nsegments and limit the Company’s ability to set prices for new or renewing groups, or both, based on specific characteristics of the group or the group’s prior\nclaim experience. In some states, these laws and regulations restrict the Company’s ability to price for the risk it assumes and/or reflect reasonable costs in the\nCompany’s pricing.\nThe ACA expanded the premium rate review process by, among other things, requiring the Company’s Commercial Insured rates to be reviewed for\n“reasonableness” at either the state or the federal level. HHS established a federal premium rate review process that generally applies to proposed premium rate\nincreases equal to or exceeding a federally (or lower state) specified threshold. HHS’s rate review process imposes additional public disclosure requirements as\nwell as additional review on filings requesting premium rate increases equal to or exceeding this “reasonableness” threshold. These combined state and federal\nreview requirements may prevent, further delay or otherwise affect the Company’s ability to price for the risk it assumes, which could adversely affect its\nMBRs and operating results, particularly during periods of increased utilization of medical services and/or medical cost trend or when such utilization and/or\ntrend exceeds the Company’s projections.\nThe ACA also specifies minimum MLRs of 85% for large group Commercial products and 80% for individual and small group Commercial products. Because\nthe ACA minimum MLRs are structured as “floors” for many of their requirements, states have the latitude to enact more stringent rules governing these\nrestrictions. For Commercial products, states have and may adopt higher minimum MLR requirements, use more stringent definitions of “medical loss ratio,”\nincorporate minimum MLR requirements into prospective premium rate filings, require prior approval of premium rates or impose other requirements related\nto minimum MLR. Minimum MLR requirements and similar actions further limit the level of margin the Company can earn in its Insured Commercial\nproducts while leaving the Company exposed to medical costs that are higher than those reflected in its pricing. The Company also may be subject to\nsignificant fines, penalties, premium refunds and litigation if it fails to comply with minimum MLR laws and regulations.\nIn addition, the Company requested increases in its premium rates in its Commercial Health Care Benefits business for 2023 and expects to request future\nincreases in those rates in order to adequately price for projected medical cost trends, required expansions of coverage and rating limits, and significant\nassessments, fees and taxes imposed by the federal and state governments, including as a result of the ACA.

These rate increases may be significant and thus heighten the risks of\nadverse publicity, adverse regulatory action and adverse selection and the likelihood that the Company’s requested premium rate increases will be denied,\nreduced or delayed, which could lead to operating margin compression.\nMany of the laws and regulations governing the Company’s pricing and underwriting practices also limit the differentials in premium rates insurers and other\ncarriers may charge between new and renewal business, and/or between groups based on differing characteristics. They may also require that carriers disclose\nto customers the basis on which the carrier establishes new business and renewal premium rates and limit the ability of a carrier to terminate customers’\ncoverage.\nMedicaid Regulation - The Company is seeking to substantially grow its Medicaid, dual eligible and dual eligible special needs plan businesses over the next\nseveral years. As a result, the Company also is increasing its exposure to changes in government policy with respect to and/or regulation of the various\nMedicaid, dual eligible and dual eligible special needs plan programs in which the Company participates, including changes in the amounts payable to the\nCompany under those programs.\nIn addition to a quality rating system that applies to Medicaid and Managed Medicaid plans, federal regulations give states the option to choose to establish a\nminimum MLR of at least 85% for their Managed Medicaid plans, including those offered by the Company. Regardless of whether a state establishes a\nminimum MLR, it must use plan-reported MLR data to set future\n30\n\n\npayment rates for managed care, so that its plans will “reasonably achieve” an MLR of at least 85%. For Managed Medicaid products, states may use more\nstringent definitions of “medical loss ratio”, use discretion in choosing a quantitative standard for determining provider network adequacy, or impose other\nrequirements related to minimum MLR. Minimum MLR requirements and similar actions further limit the level of margin the Company can earn in its Insured\nMedicaid products while leaving the Company exposed to medical costs that are higher than those reflected in its pricing. The Company also may be subject to\nsignificant fines, penalties, premium refunds and litigation if it fails to comply with minimum MLR laws and regulations.\nStates continue to consider Medicaid expansion; however, to date 12 states have not expanded, which will drop to 11 states once South Dakota’s expansion\ntakes effect in July 2023.

While the actions of these quasi-regulatory or standard-setting\norganizations do not have the force of law, they may influence states to adopt their requirements or recommendations and influence client requirements for\nPBM, mail order pharmacy and/or specialty pharmacy services. Moreover, any standards established by these organizations could also impact the Company’s\nhealth plan clients and/or the services provided to those clients and/or the Company’s health plans.\nThe Company’s PBM activities also are regulated directly and indirectly at the federal and state levels, including being subject to the False Claims Act and state\nfalse claims acts and the AKS and state anti-kickback laws.

These laws could negatively affect the services and economic benefits\nachievable through a limited pharmacy provider network. Also, a majority of states now have some form of legislation affecting the Company’s ability (and the\nCompany’s and its client health plans’ ability) to conduct audits of network pharmacies regarding claims submitted to the Company for payment. These laws\ncould negatively affect the Company’s ability to recover overpayments of claims submitted by network pharmacies that the Company identifies through\npharmacy audits.

MAC methodology is a common cost management practice used by private and public payors (including CMS) to pay pharmacies for\ndispensing generic prescription drugs. MAC prices specify the allowable reimbursement by a PBM for a particular strength and dosage of a generic drug that is\navailable from multiple manufacturers but sold at different prices. State legislation can regulate the disclosure of MAC prices and MAC price methodologies,\nthe kinds of drugs that a PBM can pay for at a MAC price, and the rights of pharmacies to appeal a MAC price established by a PBM. These laws could\nnegatively affect the Company’s ability to establish MAC prices for generic drugs. Additionally, some states have passed legislation that would restrict certain\ntypes of retroactive reconciliation or recoupment from pharmacies in the network or create a reimbursement benchmark mandate, such as the national average\ndrug acquisition cost and/or the wholesale acquisition cost (“WAC”), plus a set dispensing fee, for pharmacies in the network.\nFormulary and Plan Design Regulation - A number of government entities regulate the administration of prescription drug benefits. HHS regulates how\nMedicare Part D formularies are developed and administered, including requiring the inclusion of all drugs in certain classes and categories, subject to limited\nexceptions. Under the ACA, CMS imposes drug coverage requirements for health plans required to cover essential health benefits, including plans offered\nthrough federal or state Public Exchanges. Additionally, the NAIC and health care accreditation agencies like NCQA and URAC have developed model acts\nand standards for formulary development that are often incorporated into government requirements. Many states regulate the scope of prescription drug\ncoverage, as well as the delivery channels to receive prescriptions, for insurers, MCOs and Medicaid managed care plans. The increasing government\nregulation of formularies could significantly affect the Company’s ability to develop and administer formularies, pharmacy networks and other plan design\nfeatures. Similarly, some states prohibit health plan sponsors from implementing certain restrictive pharmacy benefit plan design features. This regulation could\nlimit or preclude (i) limited networks, (ii) a requirement to use particular providers, (iii) copayment differentials among providers and (iv) formulary tiering\npractices.\nLaws and Regulations Related to the Retail/LTC Segment\nIn addition to the laws and regulations discussed above that may affect multiple segments of the Company’s business, the Company is subject to federal, state\nand local statutes and regulations governing the operation of its Retail/LTC segment specifically.

Although certain of the economic impacts of COVID-19 have moderated and the restrictions imposed as a result\nof COVID-19 have eased, a rise in infection rates, the development of new variants or viruses could result in, among other things, a return of the following: a\nreduction in discretionary utilization, the cancellation of elective medical procedures, reduced customer traffic and front store sales in our retail pharmacies, our\ncustomers being ordered to close or severely curtail their operations, the adoption of work-from-home policies and a reduction in diagnostic reporting due to\nreductions in health care provider visits and restrictions on our access to providers’ medical records, all of which have had a negative impact on our businesses.\nIn addition, as a result of legislative and/or regulatory responses to a rise in infection rates or the development of new variants or viruses, the premiums we\ncharge in our Insured Health Care Benefits products may prove to be insufficient to cover the cost of medical services delivered to our insured medical\nmembers, which may increase significantly as a result of higher utilization rates of medical facilities and services and other increases in associated hospital and\npharmaceutical costs.\nOver the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented various initiatives, such as COVID-19 related support programs for our customers, medical\nmembers and colleagues. If there is a rise in infection rates or the development of new variants or viruses, we may have to re-institute, extend or expand these\ninitiatives, which could adversely impact our businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition. In addition, measures that were imposed to\nlimit the spread of COVID-19 may also be re-instituted, which may lead to impacts including, but not limited to, complete or partial facility closures, labor\nshortages, financial difficulties of third-party providers, supply chain disruptions and re-introduction of remote work arrangements.

In January 2022, the HHS announced that commercial\nhealth insurers must cover the cost of up to eight rapid COVID-19 OTC test kits per individual per 30-day period. In addition, the timing of vaccine\nadministration to the general public and related costs as well as the identification of new, more infectious strains of the COVID-19 virus and whether the\nvaccines will be effective against such new strains are uncertain and may impact our MBR.\nPremiums for our Insured Health Care Benefits products, which comprised 93% of our Health Care Benefits revenues for 2022, are priced in advance based on\nour forecasts of health care and other benefit costs during a fixed premium period, which is generally twelve months.

For 2023, those forecasts include adjustments made to pricing based on prospective expectations for liabilities due to testing,\nvaccines, direct COVID-19 treatment and deferred care.

In addition, government-imposed limitations on Medicare and Medicaid\nreimbursements to health plans and providers have caused the private sector to bear a greater share of increasing health care and other benefits costs over time,\nand future amendments to the ACA that increase the uninsured population may amplify this issue. Other factors that affect our health care and other benefit\ncosts include epidemics or other pandemics, changes as a result of the ACA, changes to the ACA and other changes in the regulatory environment, the\nevolution toward a consumer driven business model, new technologies, influenza-related health care costs (which may be substantial and higher than we\nexpected), clusters of high-cost cases, health care\n37\n\n\nprovider and member fraud, and numerous other factors that are or may be beyond our control.

Our medical cost management programs may not be successful and may have a smaller impact on health care and benefit costs than we\nexpect. The factors described above may adversely affect our ability to predict and manage health care and other benefit costs, which can adversely affect our\ncompetitiveness and operating results.\nFurthermore, if we are not able to accurately and promptly anticipate and detect medical cost trends or accurately estimate the cost of incurred but not yet\nreported claims or reported claims that have not been paid, our ability to take timely corrective actions to limit future health care costs and reflect our current\nbenefit cost experience in our pricing process may be limited, which would further amplify the extent of any adverse impact on our operating results. These\nrisks are particularly acute during periods when health care and other benefit costs, utilization and/or medical cost trends experience significant volatility and\nmedical claim submission patterns are changing rapidly as a result of COVID-19.

Beginning in the second quarter and continuing\nthroughout the remainder of the year, the Company experienced reduced customer traffic in its retail pharmacies and MinuteClinic locations due to shelter-in-\nplace orders as well as reduced new therapy prescriptions and decreased long-term care prescription volume as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\naddition, the Company incurred incremental operating expenses associated with the Company’s COVID-19 pandemic response efforts and waived fees\nassociated with prescription home delivery and associated front store products. During 2020, the Company also played a key role in supporting the local\ncommunities in which it operates through the administration of diagnostic testing at its CVS pharmacy locations, as well as in long-term care facilities, at\ncommunity-based testing sites in underserved areas and through its Return Ready\nsolution. The Company also began administering COVID-19 vaccinations\nin long-term care facilities during December 2020.\nDuring the first quarter of 2021, the Company experienced reduced customer traffic in its retail pharmacies, which reflected the impact of a weaker cough, cold\nand flu season, while it administered the highest quarterly volume of COVID-19 diagnostic tests. The Company began administering COVID-19 vaccines in its\nretail pharmacies during February 2021. During the second quarter, the segment generated earnings from COVID-19 vaccines and saw improved customer\ntraffic as vaccinated customers began more actively shopping in CVS locations. During the third and fourth quarters, emerging new variants drove the\ncontinued administration of COVID-19 vaccinations (including boosters) and diagnostic testing, while the segment also generated earnings from the sale of\nover-the-counter (“OTC”",

During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company administered more than 32 million COVID-19\ntests and more than 59 million COVID-19 vaccines and sold more than 22 million OTC test kits.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the customary quarterly operating income progression in the Retail/LTC segment continued to be impacted by\nCOVID-19. During the first quarter, the Company saw high volumes of administration of COVID-19 vaccinations, as well as demand for OTC test kits in the\nfront store, particularly in the beginning of the year when\nSM \n71\n\n\nthe Omicron variant incidence was high. In addition, the Company administered the highest quarterly volume of COVID-19 diagnostic tests of 2022 during the\nfirst quarter, however a decline compared to the prior year. During the second and third quarters, the Company continued to generate earnings from the sale of\nOTC test kits, as customers performed more in-home testing versus diagnostic testing, in addition to earnings from the continued administration of COVID-19\ndiagnostic testing and vaccinations, albeit at lower levels than those experienced in the first quarter. During the fourth quarter, the Company saw an increase in\nCOVID-19 vaccine administration from the prior quarter related to the bivalent COVID-19 booster. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company\nadministered more than 15 million COVID-19 tests and nearly 28 million COVID-19 vaccines and sold more than 63 million OTC test kits.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve. The Company believes COVID-19’s impact on its businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial\ncondition primarily will be driven by the geographies impacted and the severity and duration of the pandemic; the pandemic’s impact on the U.S. and global\neconomies and consumer behavior and health care utilization patterns; and the timing, scope and impact of legislation as well as other federal, state and local\ngovernmental responses to the pandemic. Those primary drivers are beyond the Company’s knowledge and control. As a result, the impact COVID-19 will\nhave on the Company’s businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition is uncertain, but the impact could be adverse and material. COVID-\n19 also may result in legal and regulatory proceedings, investigations and claims against the Company.\n72\n\n\nResults of Operations\nThe following information summarizes the Company’s results of operations for 2022 compared to 2021.

The decrease in operating income was primarily driven by the $5.8 billion\nof opioid litigation charges and declines in the Retail/LTC segment, which included a $2.5 billion loss on assets held for sale related to the write-down of\nthe Company’s Omnicare  long-term care business (“LTC business”) during 2022, partially offset by the absence of a store impairment charge of\napproximately $1.4 billion and a $431 million goodwill impairment charge on the remaining goodwill of the LTC reporting unit, both of which were\nrecorded in the prior year. These decreases were partially offset by increases in the Health Care Benefits segment, which included the pre-tax gains of\n$250 million on the sale of bswift and $225 million on the sale of PayFlex and a decrease in amortization of intangible assets, as well as improved\npurchasing economics and growth in specialty pharmacy in the Pharmacy Services segment.\n•\nPlease see “Segment Analysis” later in this MD&A for additional information about the operating results of the Company’s segments.\nInterest expense\n•\nInterest expense decreased $216 million, or 8.6%, in 2022 compared to 2021, due to lower debt in the year ended December 31, 2022. See “Liquidity and\nCapital Resources” later in this report for additional information.\nLoss on early extinguishment of debt\n•\nDuring 2021, the loss on early extinguishment of debt relates to the Company’s repayment of approximately $2.3 billion of its outstanding senior notes in\nDecember 2021 pursuant to its early redemption make-whole provision for such senior notes, which resulted in a loss on early extinguishment of debt of\n$89 million, and the repayment of approximately $2.0 billion of its outstanding senior notes pursuant to its tender offer for such notes in August 2021,\nwhich resulted in a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $363 million.

Although intangible assets contribute to the Company’s revenue generation, the amortization of intangible assets does not\ndirectly relate to the underwriting of the Company’s insurance products, the services performed for the Company’s customers or the sale of the Company’s products or services. Additionally,\nintangible asset amortization expense typically fluctuates based on the size and timing of the Company’s acquisition activity. Accordingly, the Company believes excluding the amortization of\nintangible assets enhances the Company’s and investors’ ability to compare the Company’s past financial performance with its current performance and to analyze underlying business\nperformance and trends.

The increase was primarily due to incremental costs associated with\nincreased volume, increased investments in the segment’s operations and capabilities, as well as decreased gains from legal settlements in 2022 compared\nto 2021. These increases were partially offset by lower expenses associated with COVID-19 vaccination administration compared to the prior year and the\nfavorable impact of business initiatives in 2022.\n•\nOperating expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to 19.4% in 2022 compared to 20.1% in 2021.

The decrease in adjusted operating income was primarily driven\nby decreased COVID-19 vaccinations and diagnostic testing, continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure, increased investments in the segment’s\noperations and capabilities and decreased gains from legal settlements in 2022 compared to 2021.

If the pharmacy reimbursement pressure accelerates, the segment may not be able to\ngrow revenues, and its adjusted operating income could be adversely affected.\n•\nThe increased use of generic drugs has positively impacted the segment’s adjusted operating income but has resulted in third-party payors\naugmenting their efforts to reduce reimbursement payments to retail pharmacies for prescriptions.

The RBC framework described above for\ninsurers has been extended by the NAIC to health organizations, including HMOs.

Estimates and judgments are based on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to\nbe important at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, the Company reviews its accounting policies and how they are\napplied and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements. While the Company believes the historical experience, current trends and other factors\nconsidered by management support the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, actual\nresults could differ from estimates, and such differences could be material.\nSignificant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 ‘‘Significant Accounting Policies’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K.

Revenue is recognized based on customer billings,\nwhich, in the Company’s Commercial business, reflect contracted rates per member and the number of covered members recorded in the Company’s records at\nthe time the billings are prepared.

These adjustments are known\nas retroactivity adjustments. In each period, the Company estimates the amount of future retroactivity and adjusts the recorded revenue accordingly. As\ninformation regarding actual retroactivity amounts becomes known, the Company refines its estimates and records any required adjustments to revenues in the\nperiod in which they arise. A significant difference in the actual level of retroactivity compared to estimated levels would have a significant effect on the\nCompany’s operating results.\nPremium Revenue\nPremiums are recognized as revenue in the month in which the enrollee is entitled to receive health care services. Premiums are reported net of an allowance\nfor estimated terminations and uncollectible amounts. Additionally, premium revenue subject to the MLR rebate requirements of the ACA is recorded net of the\nestimated minimum MLR rebates for the current calendar year. Premiums related to unexpired contractual coverage periods (unearned premiums) are reported\nas other insurance liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized as revenue when earned.\nSome of the Company’s contracts allow for premiums to be adjusted to reflect actual experience or the relative health status of Insured members. Such\nadjustments are reasonably estimable at the outset of the contract, and adjustments to those estimates are made based on actual experience of the customer\nemerging under the contract and the terms of the underlying contract.\nServices Revenue\nServices revenue relates to contracts that can include various combinations of services or series of services which generally are capable of being distinct and\naccounted for as separate performance obligations. The Health Care Benefits segment’s services revenue primarily consists of ASC fees received in exchange\nfor performing certain claim processing and member services for ASC members. ASC fee revenue is recognized over the period the service is provided. Some\nof the Company’s administrative services contracts include guarantees with respect to certain functions, such as customer service response time, claim\nprocessing accuracy and claim processing turnaround time, as well as certain guarantees that a plan sponsor’s benefit claim experience will fall within a certain\nrange. With any of these guarantees, the Company is financially at risk if the conditions of the arrangements are not met, although the maximum amount at risk\ntypically is limited to a percentage of the fees otherwise payable to the Company by the customer involved.

The insurance premiums include a beneficiary premium, which is the responsibility of the PDP member, and can be subsidized by\nCMS in the case of low-income members, and a direct premium paid by CMS. Premiums collected in advance are initially recorded within other insurance\nliabilities and are then recognized ratably as revenue over the period in which members are entitled to receive benefits.\nRevenues also include a risk-sharing feature of the Medicare Part D program design referred to as the risk corridor. The Company estimates variable\nconsideration in the form of amounts payable to, or receivable from, CMS under the risk corridor, and adjusts revenue based on calculations of additional\nsubsidies to be received from or owed to CMS at the end of the reporting year.\nIn addition to Medicare Part D premiums, the Company receives additional payments each month from CMS related to catastrophic reinsurance, low-income\ncost-sharing subsidies and coverage gap benefits. If the subsidies received differ from the amounts earned from actual prescriptions transferred, the difference\nis recorded in either accounts receivable, net or accrued expenses.\nPharmacy Services Segment\nThe Pharmacy Services segment sells prescription drugs directly through its mail service dispensing pharmacies and indirectly through the Company’s retail\npharmacy network. The Company’s pharmacy benefit arrangements are accounted for in a manner consistent with a master supply arrangement as there are no\ncontractual minimum volumes and each prescription is considered a separate purchasing decision and distinct performance obligation transferred at a point in\ntime. PBM services performed in connection with each prescription claim are considered part of a single performance obligation which culminates in the\ndispensing of prescription drugs.\nThe Company recognizes revenue using the gross method at the contract price negotiated with its clients when the Company has concluded it controls the\nprescription drug before it is transferred to the client plan members. The Company controls prescriptions dispensed indirectly through its retail pharmacy\nnetwork because it has separate contractual arrangements with those pharmacies, has discretion in setting the price for the transaction and assumes primary\nresponsibility for fulfilling the promise to provide prescription drugs to its client plan members while also performing the related PBM services.\nRevenues include (i) the portion of the price the client pays directly to the Company, net of any discounts earned on brand name drugs or other discounts and\nrefunds paid back to the client (see “Drug Discounts” and “Guarantees” below), (ii) the price paid to the Company by client plan members for mail order\nprescriptions and the price paid to retail network pharmacies by client plan members for retail prescriptions (“retail co-payments”), and (i",

The Company has established the following revenue recognition policies for the\nPharmacy Services segment:\n•\nRevenues generated from prescription drugs sold by mail service dispensing pharmacies are recognized when the prescription drug is delivered to the\nclient plan member. At the time of delivery, the Company has performed substantially all of its performance obligations under its client contracts and does\nnot experience a significant level of returns or reshipments.\n•\nRevenues generated from prescription drugs sold by third party pharmacies in the Company’s retail pharmacy network and associated administrative fees\nare recognized at the Company’s point-of-sale, which is when the claim is adjudicated by the Company’s online claims processing system and the\nCompany has transferred control of the prescription drug and completed all of its performance obligations.\nFor contracts under which the Company acts as an agent or does not control the prescription drugs prior to transfer to the client plan member, revenue is\nrecognized using the net method.\nDrug Discounts\nThe Company records revenue net of manufacturers’ rebates earned by its clients based on their plan members’ utilization of brand-name formulary drugs. The\nCompany estimates these rebates at period-end based on actual and estimated claims data and its estimates of the manufacturers’ rebates earned by its clients.\nThe estimates are based on the best available data at period-end and recent history for the various factors that can affect the amount of rebates due to the client.\nThe Company adjusts its rebates\n94\n\n\npayable to clients to the actual amounts paid when these rebates are paid or as significant events occur. Any cumulative effect of these adjustments is recorded\nagainst revenues at the time it is identified. Adjustments generally result from contract changes with clients or manufacturers that have retroactive rebate\nadjustments, differences between the estimated and actual product mix subject to rebates, or whether the brand name drug was included in the applicable\nformulary. The effect of adjustments between estimated and actual manufacturers’ rebate amounts has not been material to the Company’s operating results or\nfinancial condition.\nGuarantees\nThe Company also adjusts revenues for refunds owed to clients resulting from pricing guarantees and performance against defined service and performance\nmetrics.

Revenues are adjusted for refunds owed to third party payers resulting from pricing guarantees and performance against defined value-based\nservice and performance metrics.

Any amounts not expected\nto be redeemed by customers (i.e., breakage) are recognized based on historical redemption patterns.\nCustomer returns are not material to the Company’s operating results or financial condition. Sales taxes are not included in revenues.\nLoyalty and Other Programs\nThe Company’s customer loyalty program, ExtraCare , consists of two components, ExtraSavings\n and ExtraBucks  Rewards. ExtraSavings are coupons that\nare recorded as a reduction of revenue when redeemed as the Company concluded that they do not represent a promise to the customer to deliver additional\ngoods or services at the time of issuance because they are not tied to a specific transaction or spending level.\nExtraBucks Rewards are accumulated by customers based on their historical spending levels. Thus, the Company has determined that there is an additional\nperformance obligation to those customers at the time of the initial transaction. The Company allocates the transaction price to the initial transaction and the\nExtraBucks Rewards transaction based upon the relative standalone selling price, which considers historical redemption patterns for the rewards. Revenue\nallocated to ExtraBucks Rewards is recognized as those rewards are redeemed. At the end of each period, unredeemed ExtraBucks Rewards are reflected as a\ncontract liability.\nThe Company also offers a subscription-based membership program, CarePass , under which members are entitled to a suite of benefits delivered over the\ncourse of the subscription period, as well as a promotional reward that can be redeemed for future goods and services.

Generally, the\nrenewal option periods are not included within the lease term and the associated payments are not included in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and\nlease liability.

The fair value of the reporting units is estimated using a combination of a discounted cash flow method and a market multiple\nmethod. If the net book value (carrying amount) of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the reporting unit’s goodwill is considered to be impaired, and an\nimpairment is recognized in an amount equal to the excess.\nThe determination of the fair value of the reporting units requires the Company to make significant assumptions and estimates.

Significant judgment is required in determining uncertain tax positions.\nThe Company has established accruals for uncertain tax positions using its judgment and adjusts these accruals, as warranted, due to changing facts and\ncircumstances.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 ‘‘Significant Accounting Policies’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for a description of new accounting pronouncements applicable to the Company.\n101\n\n\nTable of Contents\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nThe Company’s earnings and financial condition are exposed to interest rate risk, credit quality risk, market valuation risk, foreign currency risk, commodity\nrisk and operational risk.\nEvaluation of Interest Rate and Credit Quality Risk\nThe Company manages interest rate risk by seeking to maintain a tight match between the durations of assets and liabilities when appropriate. The Company\nmanages credit quality risk by seeking to maintain high average credit quality ratings and diversified sector exposure within its debt securities portfolio. In\nconnection with its investment and risk management objectives, the Company also uses derivative financial instruments whose market value is at least partially\ndetermined by, among other things, levels of or changes in interest rates (short-term or long-term), duration, prepayment rates, equity markets or credit\nratings/spreads. The Company’s use of these derivatives is generally limited to hedging risk and has principally consisted of using interest rate swaps, treasury\nrate locks, forward contracts, futures contracts, warrants, put options and credit default swaps. These instruments, viewed separately, subject the Company to\nvarying degrees of interest rate, equity price and credit risk. However, when used for",

See Note 2 ‘‘Acquisitions, Divestitures and Asset Sales’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\nInvestment risks associated with experience-rated products generally do not impact the Company’s operating results. The risks associated with investments\nsupporting experience-rated pension and annuity products in the large case pensions business in the Company’s Corporate/Other segment are assumed by the\ncontract holders and not by the Company (subject to, among other things, certain minimum guarantees). Assets supporting experience-rated products may be\nsubject to contract holder or participant withdrawals.\nThe debt securities in the Company’s investment portfolio had an average credit quality rating of A at both December 31, 2022 and 2021, with a fair value of\napproximately $6.0 billion and $6.7 billion rated AAA at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The fair value of debt securities that were rated below\ninvestment grade (that is, having a credit quality rating below BBB-/Baa3) was $1.9 billion and $2.3 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively (of\nwhich 1.6% and 2.0% at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, supported experience-rated products).\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company held $202 million and $305 million, respectively, of municipal debt securities that were guaranteed by third\nparties, representing 1% of total investments at both December 31, 2022 and 2021. These securities had an average credit quality rating of AA+ and AA at\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, with the guarantee. These securities had an average credit quality rating of A at both December 31, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively, without the guarantee. The Company does not have any significant concentration of investments with third party guarantors (either direct or\nindirect).\nThe Company generally classifies debt securities as available for sale, and carries them at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets. At both December 31,\n2022 and 2021, less than 1% of debt securities were valued using inputs that reflect the Company’s assumptions (categorized as Level 3 inputs in accordance\nwith accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America). See Note 4 ‘‘Fair Value’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional\ninformation on the methodologies and key assumptions used to determine the fair value of investments.

If a debt security is in an unrealized loss\nposition and the Company does not have the intent to sell and it is more likely than not that the Company will not have to sell such security before recovery of\nits amortized cost basis, the Company bifurcates the impairment into credit-related and non-credit related components. The amount of the credit-related\ncomponent is recorded as an allowance for credit losses and recognized in net income, and the amount of the non-credit related component is included in other\ncomprehensive income (loss). The impairment of debt securities is considered a critical accounting policy. See ‘‘Critical Accounting Policies - Impairments of\nDebt Securities” in the MD&A included in Item 7 of this 10-K for additional information.\nEvaluation of Market Valuation Risks\nThe Company regularly evaluates its risk from market-sensitive instruments by examining, among other things, levels of or changes in interest rates (short-term\nor long-term), duration, prepayment rates, equity markets and/or credit ratings/spreads. The Company also regularly evaluates the appropriateness of\ninvestments relative to management-approved investment guidelines (and operates within those guidelines) and the business objectives of its portfolios.\nOn a quarterly basis, the Company reviews the impact of hypothetical net losses in its investment portfolio on the Company’s consolidated near-term financial\ncondition, operating results and cash flows assuming the occurrence of certain reasonably possible changes in near-term market rates and prices. Interest rate\nchanges (whether resulting from changes in treasury yields or credit spreads or other factors) represent the most material risk exposure category for the\nCompany. The Company has estimated the impact on the fair value of market sensitive instruments based on the net present value of cash flows using a\nrepresentative set of likely future interest rate scenarios. The assumptions used were as follows: an immediate increase of 100 basis points in interest rates\n(which the Company believes represents a moderately adverse scenario) for long-term debt issued by the Company, as well as its interest rate sensitive\ninvestments and an immediate decrease of 15% in prices for publicly traded domestic equity securities in the Company’s investment portfolio.\nAssuming an immediate inc",

Changes in the fair value of\nlong-term debt do not impact the Company’s operating results or financial condition.\n•\nThe theoretical reduction in the fair value of interest rate sensitive investments partially offset by the theoretical reduction in the fair value of interest rate\nsensitive liabilities would result in a net decline in fair value of approximately $595 million ($750 million pretax) related to continuing non-experience-\nrated products. Reductions in the fair value of investment securities would be reflected as an unrealized loss in equity, as the Company classifies these debt\nsecurities as available for sale. The Company does not record liabilities at fair value.\nIf the value of the Company’s publicly traded domestic equity securities held within its investment portfolio were to decline by 15%, this would result in a net\ndecline in fair value of $20 million ($26 million pretax).\nBased on overall exposure to interest rate risk and equity price risk, the Company believes that these changes in market rates and prices would not materially\naffect consolidated near-term financial condition, operating results or cash flows as of December 31, 2022.\nEvaluation of Foreign Currency and Commodity Risk\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company did not have any material foreign currency exchange rate or commodity derivative instruments in place and\nbelieves its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk is not material.\nEvaluation of Operational Risks\nThe Company also faces certain operational risks. Those risks include risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic and risks related to information security,\nincluding cybersecurity.\nThe spread of COVID-19, or actions taken to mitigate its spread, could have material and adverse effects on our ability to operate our businesses effectively,\nincluding as a result of the complete or partial closure of facilities or labor shortages.

See Note 2 ‘‘Acquisitions, Divestitures and Asset Sales’’\nfor additional information on the Company’s sale of PayFlex.\n113\n\n\nInvestments\nDebt Securities\nDebt securities consist primarily of U.S. Treasury and agency securities, mortgage-backed securities, corporate and foreign bonds and other debt securities.\nDebt securities are classified as either current or long-term investments based on their contractual maturities unless the Company intends to sell an investment\nwithin the next twelve months, in which case it is classified as current on the consolidated balance sheets. Debt securities are classified as available for sale and\nare carried at fair value. See Note 4 ‘‘Fair Value’’ for additional information on how the Company estimates the fair value of these investments.\nIf a debt security is in an unrealized loss position and the Company has the intent to sell the security, or it is more likely than not that the Company will have to\nsell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the amortized cost basis of the security is written down to its fair value and the difference is\nrecognized in net income. If a debt security is in an unrealized loss position and the Company does not have the intent to sell and it is more likely than not that\nthe Company will not have to sell such security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the Company bifurcates the impairment into credit-related and non-\ncredit related (yield-related) components.

The amount of the credit-related component is recorded as an allowance for credit losses and recognized in net income, and the\namount of the non-credit related component is included in other comprehensive income (loss). Interest is not accrued on debt securities when management\nbelieves the collection of interest is unlikely.\nThe credit-related component is determined by comparing the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security, considering all reasonably\navailable information relevant to the collectability of the security, with the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be\ncollected is less than the amortized cost basis of the security, the Company records an allowance for credit losses, which is limited by the amount that the fair\nvalue is less than amortized cost basis.\nFor mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities, the Company recognizes income using an effective yield based on anticipated prepayments and the\nestimated economic life of the securities. When estimates of prepayments change, the effective yield is recalculated to reflect actual payments to date and\nanticipated future payments. The Company’s investment in the security is adjusted to the amount that would have existed had the new effective yield been\napplied since the acquisition of the security, with adjustments recognized in net income.\nEquity Securities\nEquity securities with readily available fair values are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income.\nMortgage Loans\nMortgage loan investments on the consolidated balance sheets are valued at the unpaid principal balance, net of an allowance for credit losses. Mortgage loans\nwith a maturity date or a committed prepayment date within twelve months are classified as current on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company assesses\nwhether its loans share similar risk characteristics and, if so, groups such loans in a risk pool when measuring expected credit losses. The Company considers\nthe following characteristics when evaluating whether its loans share similar risk characteristics: loan-to-value ratios, property type (e.g., office, retail,\napartment, industrial), geographic location, vacancy rates and property condition.\nCredit loss reserves are determined using a loss rate method that multiplies the unpaid principal balance of each loan within a risk pool group by an estimated\nloss rate percentage. The loss rate percentage considers both the expected loan loss severity and the probability of loan default.

Interest income on problem loans (i.e., more than 60 days delinquent, in bankruptcy or in\nprocess of foreclosure) is recognized on a cash basis. Cash payments on loans in the process of foreclosure are treated as a return of principal.\n114\n\n\nOther Investments\nOther investments consist primarily of the following:\n•\nPrivate equity and hedge fund limited partnerships, which are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Under this method, the carrying value\nof the investment is based on the value of the Company’s equity ownership of the underlying investment funds provided by the general partner or manager\nof the investments, the financial statements of which generally are audited. As a result of the timing of the receipt of the valuation information provided by\nthe fund managers, these investments are generally reported on up to a three month lag. The Company reviews investments for impairment at least\nquarterly and monitors their performance throughout the year through discussions with the administrators, managers and/or general partners. If the\nCompany becomes aware of an impairment of a limited partnership’s investments through its review or prior to receiving the limited partnership’s\nfinancial statements at the financial statement date, an impairment will be recognized by recording a reduction in the carrying value of the limited\npartnership with a corresponding charge to net investment income.\n•\nInvestment real estate, which is carried on the consolidated balance sheets at depreciated cost, including capital additions, net of write-downs for other-\nthan-temporary declines in fair value. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful life of each asset. If any real\nestate investment is considered held-for-sale, it is carried at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less estimated selling costs. The Company\ngenerally estimates fair value using net operating income and applying a capitalization rate in conjunction with comparable sales information. At the time\nof the sale, the difference between the sales price and the carrying value is recorded as a realized capital gain or loss.\n•\nPrivately-placed equity securities, which are carried on the consolidated balance sheets at cost less impairments, plus or minus subsequent adjustments for\nobservable price changes.

Experience-rated products are products in the large case pensions business where the contract holder,\nnot the Company, assumes investment and other risks, subject to, among other things, minimum guarantees provided by the Company. The effect of investment\nperformance on experience-rated products is allocated to contract holders’ accounts daily, based on the underlying investment experience and, therefore, does\nnot impact the Company’s net income (as long as the contract’s minimum guarantees are not triggered). Net investment income on assets supporting large case\npensions’ experience-rated products is included in net investment income in the consolidated statements of operations and is credited to contract holders’\naccounts through a charge to benefit costs.

During the interim\nperiod between physical inventory counts, the Company accrues for anticipated physical inventory losses on a location-by-location basis based on historical\nresults and current physical inventory trends.\nReinsurance Recoverables\nThe Company utilizes reinsurance agreements primarily to: (a) reduce required capital and (b) facilitate the acquisition or disposition of certain insurance\ncontracts. Ceded reinsurance agreements permit the Company to recover a portion of its losses from reinsurers, although they do not discharge the Company’s\nprimary liability as the direct insurer of the risks reinsured. Failure of reinsurers to indemnify the Company could result in losses; however, the Company does\nnot expect charges for unrecoverable reinsurance to have a material effect on its consolidated operating results or financial condition.

See Note 6 ‘‘Leases’’ for additional information\nabout these impairment charges as well as the Company’s finance leases.\nRight-of-Use Assets and Lease Liabilities\nThe Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at the inception of a contract. Right-of-use assets represent the Company’s right to use an\nunderlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Right-of-use assets\nand lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date of the lease, renewal date of the lease or significant remodeling of the lease space based on the\npresent value of the remaining future minimum lease payments. As the interest rate implicit in the Company’s leases is not readily determinable, the Company\nutilizes its incremental borrowing rate, determined by class of underlying asset, to discount the lease payments. The operating lease right-of-use assets also\ninclude lease payments made before commencement and are reduced by lease incentives.\nThe Company’s real estate leases typically contain options that permit renewals for additional periods of up to five years each. For real estate leases, the\noptions to extend are not considered reasonably certain at lease commencement because the Company reevaluates each lease on a regular basis to consider the\neconomic and strategic incentives of exercising the renewal options and regularly opens or closes stores to align with its operating strategy. Generally, the\nrenewal option periods are not included within the lease term and the associated payments are not included in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and\nlease liability. Similarly, renewal options are not included in the lease term for non-real estate leases because they are not considered reasonably certain of\nbeing exercised at lease commencement. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheets, and lease expense is\nrecognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the short-term lease.\nFor real estate leases, the Company accounts for lease components and nonlease components as a single lease component. Certain real estate leases require\nadditional payments based on sales volume, as well as reimbursement for real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance, which are expensed as\nincurred as variable lease costs. Other real estate leases contain one fixed lease payment that includes real estate taxes, common area maintenance and\ninsurance. These fixed payments are considered part of the lease payment and included in the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities.\nSee",

See Note 5 ‘‘Goodwill and Other Intangibles’’ for additional information about goodwill.\nIntangible Assets\nThe Company’s identifiable intangible assets consist primarily of trademarks, trade names, customer contracts/relationships, covenants not to compete,\ntechnology, provider networks and value of business acquired (“VOBA”). These intangible assets arise primarily from the determination of their respective fair\nmarket values at the date of acquisition. Amounts assigned to identifiable intangible assets, and their related useful lives, are derived from established valuation\ntechniques and management estimates.\nThe Company’s definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives based upon the pattern of future cash flows attributable to the\nasset. Other than VOBA, definite-lived intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method. VOBA is amortized over the expected life of the acquired\ncontracts in proportion to estimated premiums. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently, if\nnecessary, as further described in “Recoverability of Long-Lived Assets” below.\nSee Note 5 ‘‘Goodwill and Other Intangibles’’ for additional information about intangible assets.\nRecoverability of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets, excluding goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are tested for impairment using\nseparate tests described below, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such asset may not be recoverable. The\nCompany groups and evaluates these long-lived assets for impairment at the lowest level at which individual cash flows can be identified. If indicators of\nimpairment are present, the Company first compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset group\n(undiscounted). If the estimated future cash flows used in this analysis are less than the carrying amount of the asset group, an impairment loss calculation is\nprepared. The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the asset group’s estimated future cash flows (discounted). If\nrequired, an impairment loss is recorded for the portion of the asset group’s carrying value that exceeds the asset group’s estimated future cash flow",

There were no material impairment charges recognized on long-lived assets during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nSee Note 6 ‘‘Leases’’ for additional information about the right-of-use asset charges.\nWhen evaluating goodwill for potential impairment, the Company compares the fair value of its reporting units to their respective carrying amounts. The\nCompany estimates the fair value of its reporting units using a combination of a discounted cash flow method and a market multiple method. If the carrying\namount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. During the third quarter of both\n2022 and 2020, the Company performed its required annual impairment tests of goodwill and concluded there were no goodwill impairments as of the testing\ndates or during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2020.

Accordingly, during the third quarter of 2021,\nthe Company recorded a $431 million goodwill impairment charge on the remaining goodwill of the LTC reporting unit. The results of the impairment tests\nindicated that there was no impairment of goodwill of the remaining reporting units as of the testing date or during the year ended December 31, 2021. See\nNote 5 ‘‘Goodwill and Other Intangibles’’ for additional information about the goodwill impairment charge recorded during the year ended December 31, 2021.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value. The Company estimates the\nfair value of its indefinite-lived trademarks using the relief from royalty method under the\n118\n\n\nincome approach. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized, and the asset is written down to its\nestimated fair value.

Unpaid health care claims include an estimate of payments the Company will make for (i) services rendered to the Company’s Insured\nmembers but not yet reported to the Company and (ii) claims which have been reported to the Company but not yet paid, each as of the financial statement date\n(collectively, “IBNR”). Health care costs payable also include an estimate of the cost of services that will continue to be rendered after the financial statement\ndate if the Company is obligated to pay for such services in accordance with contractual or regulatory requirements. Such estimates are developed using\nactuarial principles and assumptions which consider, among other things, historical and projected claim submission and processing patterns, assumed and\nhistorical medical cost trends, historical utilization of medical services, claim inventory levels, changes in Insured membership and product mix, seasonality\nand other relevant factors. The Company reflects changes in these estimates in benefit costs in the Company’s consolidated operating results in the period they\nare determined. Capitation costs represent contractual monthly fees paid to participating physicians and other medical providers for providing medical care,\nregardless of the volume of medical services provided to the Insured member.

In developing its IBNR estimate, the\nCompany consistently applies these actuarial principles and assumptions each period, with consideration to the variability of related factors. There have been\nno significant changes to the methodologies or assumptions used to develop the Company’s estimate of IBNR in 2022.\nThe Company analyzes historical claim payment patterns by comparing claim incurred dates (i.e., the date services were provided) to claim payment dates to\nestimate “completion factors.” The Company uses completion factors predominantly to estimate the ultimate cost of claims incurred more than three months\nbefore the financial statement date. The Company estimates completion factors by aggregating claim data based on the month of service and month of claim\npayment and estimating the percentage of claims incurred for a given month that are complete by each month thereafter. For any given month, substantially all\nclaims are paid within six months of the date of service, but it can take up to 48 months or longer after the date of service before all of the claims are\ncompletely resolved and paid. These historically-derived completion factors are then applied to claims paid through the financial statement date to estimate the\nultimate claim cost for a given month’s incurred claim activity. The difference between the estimated ultimate claim cost and the claims paid through the\nfinancial statement date represents the Company’s estimate of claims remaining to be paid as of the financial statement date and is included in the Company’s\nhealth care costs payable. The completion factors the Company uses reflect judgments and possible adjustments based on data such as claim inventory levels,\nclaim submission and processing patterns and, to a lesser extent, other factors such as changes in health care cost trend rates, changes in Insured membership\nand changes in product mix. If claims are submitted or processed on a faster (slower) pace than prior periods, the actual claims may be more (less) complete\nthan originally estimated using the Company’s completion factors, which may result in reserves that are higher (lower) than the ultimate cost of claims.\nBecause claims incurred within three months before the financial statement date are less mature, the Company uses a combination of historically-derived\ncompletion factors and the assumed health care cost trend rate to estimate the ultimate cost\n119\n\n\nof claims incurred for these months. The Company applies its actuarial judgment and places a greater emphasis on the assumed health care cost trend rate for\nthe most recent claim incurred dates as these months may be influenced by seasonal patterns and changes in membership and product mix.\nThe Company’s health care cost trend rate is affected by changes in per member utilization of medical services as well as changes in the unit cost of such\nservices.

The health status of the Company’s Insured\nmembers, aging of the population and other demographic characteristics, advances in medical technology and other factors continue to contribute to rising per\nmember utilization and unit costs. Changes in health care practices, inflation, new technologies, increases in the cost of prescription drugs (including specialty\npharmacy drugs), direct-to-consumer marketing by pharmaceutical companies, clusters of high-cost cases, claim intensity, changes in the regulatory\nenvironment, health care provider or member fraud and numerous other factors also contribute to the cost of health care and the Company’s health care cost\ntrend rate.\nFor each reporting period, the Company uses an extensive degree of judgment in the process of estimating its health care costs payable. As a result,\nconsiderable variability and uncertainty is inherent in such estimates, particularly with respect to claims with claim incurred dates of three months or less\nbefore the financial statement date; and the adequacy of such estimates is highly sensitive to changes in assumed completion factors and the assumed health\ncare cost trend rates. For each reporting period the Company recognizes the actuarial best estimate of health care costs payable considering the potential\nvolatility in assumed completion factors and health care cost trend rates, as well as other factors. The Company believes its estimate of health care costs\npayable is reasonable and adequate to cover its obligations at December 31, 2022; however, actual claim payments may differ from the Company’s estimates. A\nworsening (or improvement) of the Company’s health care cost trend rates or changes in completion factors from those that the Company assumed in\nestimating health care costs payable at December 31, 2022 would cause these estimates to change in the near term, and such a change could be material.\nEach quarter, the Company re-examines previously established health care costs payable estimates based on actual claim payments for prior periods and other\nchanges in facts and circumstances. Given the extensive degree of judgment in this estimate, it is possible that the Company’s estimates of health care costs\npayable could develop either favorably (that is, its actual benefit costs for the period were less than estimated) or unfavorably. The changes in the Company’s\nestimate of health care costs payable may relate to a prior quarter, prior year or earlier periods.

A premium deficiency loss is recognized when it is\nprobable that expected future claims, including maintenance costs (for example, direct costs such as claim processing costs), will exceed existing reserves plus\nanticipated future premiums and reinsurance recoveries. Anticipated investment income is not considered in the calculation of premium deficiency losses for\nshort-duration contracts.

The resulting cumulative translation\nadjustments are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\nFor U.S. dollar functional currency locations, foreign currency assets and liabilities are remeasured into U.S. dollars at end-of-period exchange rates, except for\nnonmonetary balance sheet accounts which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenues and expenses are remeasured at average exchange rates in\neffect during each period, except for those expenses related to the nonmonetary balance sheet amounts which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains\nor losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in net income.\nGains and losses from foreign currency transactions and the effects of foreign currency remeasurements were not material in the years ended December 31,\n2022, 2021 or 2020.\nRevenue Recognition\nHealth Care Benefits ",

          "chunk": "ealth Care Benefits Segment\nHealth Care Benefits revenue is principally derived from insurance premiums and fees billed to customers. Revenue is recognized based on customer billings,\nwhich, in the Company’s Commercial business, reflect contracted rates per member and the number of covered members recorded in the Company’s records at\nthe time the billings are prepared. Billings are generally sent monthly for coverage during the following month. Revenue related to the Company’s Government\nbusiness is collected monthly from the U.S. federal government and various government agencies based on fixed payment rates and member eligibility.\nThe Company’s billings may be subsequently adjusted to reflect enrollment changes due to member terminations or other factors. These adjustments are known\nas retroactivity adjustments. In each period, the Company estimates the amount of future retroactivity and adjusts the recorded revenue accordingly. As\ninformation regarding actual retroactivity amounts becomes known, the Company refines its estimates and records any required adjustments to revenues in the\nperiod in which they arise.\nPremium Revenue\nPremiums are recognized as revenue in the month in which the enrollee is entitled to receive health care services. Premiums are reported net of an allowance\nfor estimated terminations and uncollectible amounts. Additionally, premium revenue subject to the minimum medical loss ratio (“MLR”) rebate requirements\nof the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (as amended, collectively, the “ACA”) is\nrecorded net of the estimated minimum MLR rebates for the current calendar year. Premiums related to unexpired contractual coverage periods (unearned\npremiums) are reported as other insurance liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized as revenue when earned.\nSome of the Company’s contracts allow for premiums to be adjusted to reflect actual experience or the relative health status of Insured members. Such\nadjustments are reasonably estimable at the outset of the contract, and adjustments to those estimates are made based on actual experience of the customer\nemerging under the contract and the terms of the underlying contract.\nServices Revenue\nServices revenue relates to contracts that can include various combinations of services or series of services which generally are capable of being distinct and\naccounted for as separate performance obligations. The Health Care Benefits segment’s services revenue primarily consists of ASC fees received in exchange\nfor performing certain claim processing and member services for ASC members. ASC fee revenue is recognized over the period the service is provided. Some\nof the Company’s administrative services contracts include guarantees with respect to certain functions, such as customer service response time, claim\nprocessing accuracy and claim processing turnaround time, as well as certain guarantees that a plan ",

With any of these guarantees, the Company is financially at risk if the conditions of the arrangements are not met, although the maximum amount at risk\ntypically is limited to a percentage of the fees otherwise payable to the Company by the customer involved. Each period the Company estimates its obligations\nunder the terms of these guarantees and records its estimate as an offset to services revenues.\nAccounting for Medicare Part D\nRevenues include insurance premiums earned by the Company’s PDPs, which are determined based on the PDP’s annual bid and related contractual\narrangements with the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”). The insurance\n122\n\n\npremiums include a beneficiary premium, which is the responsibility of the PDP member, and can be subsidized by CMS in the case of low-income members,\nand a direct premium paid by CMS. Premiums collected in advance are initially recorded within other insurance liabilities and are then recognized ratably as\nrevenue over the period in which members are entitled to receive benefits.\nRevenues also include a risk-sharing feature of the Medicare Part D program design referred to as the risk corridor. The Company estimates variable\nconsideration in the form of amounts payable to, or receivable from, CMS under the risk corridor, and adjusts revenue based on calculations of additional\nsubsidies to be received from or owed to CMS at the end of the reporting year.\nIn addition to Medicare Part D premiums, the Company receives additional payments each month from CMS related to catastrophic reinsurance, low-income\ncost-sharing subsidies and coverage gap benefits. If the subsidies received differ from the amounts earned from actual prescriptions transferred, the difference\nis recorded in either accounts receivable, net or accrued expenses.\nPharmacy Services Segment\nThe Pharmacy Services segment sells prescription drugs directly through its mail service dispensing pharmacies and indirectly through the Company’s retail\npharmacy network. The Company’s pharmacy benefit arrangements are accounted for in a manner consistent with a master supply arrangement as there are no\ncontractual minimum volumes and each prescription is considered a separate purchasing decision and distinct performance obligation transferred at a point in\ntime. PBM services performed in connection with each prescription claim are considered part of a single performance obligation which culminates in the\ndispensing of prescription drugs.\nThe Company recognizes revenue using the gross method at the contract price negotiated with its clients when the Company has concluded it controls the\nprescription drug before it is transferred to the client plan members. The Company controls prescriptions dispensed indirectly through its retail pharmacy\nnetwork because it has separate contractual arrangements with those pharmacies, has discretion in setting the pr",

The\nCompany estimates these rebates at period-end based on actual and estimated claims data and its estimates of the manufacturers’ rebates earned by its clients.\nThe estimates are based on the best available data at period-end and recent history for the various factors that can affect the amount of rebates due to the client.\nThe Company adjusts its rebates payable to clients to the actual amounts paid when these rebates are paid or as significant events occur.

Thus, the Company has determined that there is an additional\nperformance obligation to those customers at the time of the initial transaction. The Company allocates the transaction price to the initial transaction and the\nExtraBucks Rewards transaction based upon the relative standalone selling price, which considers historical redemption patterns for the rewards.

The Company recognizes the funded status of its pension and OPEB plans on the consolidated balance sheets based on the year-end measurements of\nplan assets and benefit obligations. When the fair value of plan assets are in excess of the plan benefit obligations, the amounts are reported in other current\nassets and other assets. When the fair value of plan benefit obligations are in excess of plan assets, the amounts are reported in accrued expenses and other\nlong-term liabilities based on the amount by which the actuarial present value of benefits payable in the next twelve months included in the benefit obligation\nexceeds the fair value of plan assets. The net periodic benefit income for the Company’s pension and OPEB plans do not contain a service cost component as\nthese plans have been frozen for an extended period of time. Non-service cost components of pension and postretirement net periodic benefit income are\nincluded in other income in the consolidated statements of operations.\nEarnings per Share\nEarnings per share is computed using the treasury stock method.

The Company does not have a future obligation to fund losses or debts on behalf of these investments; however, it may\nvoluntarily contribute funds.

The Red Oak arrangement had an initial term of ten years. In 2021, the Red Oak arrangement was amended\nto extend the initial term an additional five years, for a total term of 15 years. Under this arrangement, the Company and Cardinal contributed their sourcing\nand supply chain expertise to Red Oak and agreed to source and negotiate generic pharmaceutical supply contracts for both companies through Red Oak;\nhowever, Red Oak does not own or hold inventory on behalf of either company. No physical assets (e.g., property and equipment) were contributed to Red Oak\nby either company, and minimal funding was provided to capitalize Red Oak. The Company has determined that it is the primary beneficiary of this VIE\nbecause it has the ability to direct the activities of Red Oak. Consequently, the Company consolidates Red Oak in its consolidated financial statements within\nthe Retail/LTC segment.\nCardinal is required to pay the Company quarterly payments, which began in October 2014 and will extend through June 2029. As milestones are met, the\nquarterly payments increase. The Company received $183 million from Cardinal during each of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.

This standard requires the Company to review cash flow assumptions for its long-duration insurance contracts at least annually and recognize the\neffect of changes in future cash flow assumptions in net income. This standard also requires the Company to update discount rate assumptions quarterly and\nrecognize the effect of changes in these assumptions in other comprehensive income (loss). The rate used to discount the Company’s liability for future policy\nbenefits will be based on an estimate of the yield for an upper-medium grade fixed-income instrument with a duration profile matching that of the Company’s\nliabilities. In addition, this standard changes the amortization method for deferred acquisition costs and requires additional disclosures regarding the long\nduration insurance contract liabilities in the Company’s interim and annual financial statements. The standard is effective for public companies for fiscal years,\nand interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company adopted this accounting standard on January 1, 2023, using the\nmodified retrospective transition method as of the earliest period presented, January 1, 2021, also referred to as the transition date, for changes primarily related\nto the liability for future policy benefits and deferred acquisition costs. The Company is still in the process of finalizing the impact of the new standard on its\nhistorical financial statements, but expects to record an increase to its liability for future policy benefits with a corresponding change in accumulated other\ncomprehensive income on the transition date of approximately $1 billion as a result of updating the rate used to discount the liabilities to reflect the yield for an\nupper-medium grade fixed-income instrument compared to the Company’s expected investment yield under the existing guidance.\n131\n\n\n2.\nAcquisitions, Divestitures and Asset Sales\nProposed Oak Street Health Acquisition\nOn February 7, 2023, the Company entered into a definitive merger agreement to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Oak Street Health, Inc.

Accordingly, in the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded office real estate optimization charges of\n$117 million, primarily consisting of $71 million related to operating lease right-of-use assets and $44 million related to property and equipment, within the\nHealth Care Benefits, Corporate/Other and Pharmacy Services segments.\nStore Impairment Charges\nThe Company evaluates its retail store right-of-use and property and equipment assets for impairment at the retail store level, which is the lowest level at which\ncash flows can be identified. For retail stores where there is an indicator of impairment present, the Company first compares the carrying amount of the asset\ngroup to the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset group (undiscounted). If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows used in the analysis are\nless than the carrying amount of the asset group, an impairment loss calculation is prepared. The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying amount of\nthe asset group to its estimated fair value which is the greater of the asset group’s estimated future cash flows (discounted), or the consideration of what a\nmarket participant would pay to lease the assets, net of leasing costs. The Company’s estimate of fair value considers historical results, current operating trends,\nconsolidated sales, profitability and cash flow results and forecasts. For assets which the Company has determined it will be able to sublease, the estimated\nfuture cash flows include the estimated sublease income, net of estimated leasing costs.\nWhen the carrying value of an asset group exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recorded to reduce the value of the asset group to its estimated\nfair value. As the impaired assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis primarily using unobservable inputs as of the measurement date, the assets\nare classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company completed a strategic review of its retail business and announced the creation of new formats for its stores to\ncontinue to drive higher engagement with customers. As part of this review, the Company evaluated changes in population, consumer buying patterns and\nfuture health needs to ensure it has the right kinds of stores in the right locations for consumers and for the business. In connection with this initiative, on\nNovember 17, 2021, the Board of Directors of CVS Health Corporation (the “Board”) authorized the closing of approximately 900 retail stores, approximately\n300 stores each year, between 2022 and 2024. As a result, management determined that there were indicators of impairment with respect to the impacted stores’\nasset groups, including the associated operating lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment.

The Company believes COVID-19’s impact on its businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial\ncondition primarily will be driven by the geographies impacted and the severity and duration of the pandemic; the pandemic’s impact on the U.S. and global\neconomies and consumer behavior and health care utilization patterns; and the timing, scope and impact of legislation as well as other federal, state and local\ngovernmental responses to the pandemic. Those primary drivers are beyond the Company’s knowledge and control. As a result, the impact COVID-19 will\nhave on the Company’s businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition is uncertain, but the impact could be adverse and material. COVID-\n19 also may result in legal and regulatory proceedings, investigations and claims against the Company.\nGuarantees\nThe Company has the following significant guarantee arrangements at December 31, 2022:\n•\nASC Claim Funding Accounts - The Company has arrangements with certain banks for the processing of claim payments for its ASC customers. The\nbanks maintain accounts to fund claims of the Company’s ASC customers. The customer is responsible for funding the amount paid by the bank each day.\nIn these arrangements, the Company guarantees that the banks will not sustain losses if the responsible ASC customer does not properly fund its account.\nThe aggregate maximum exposure under these arrangements is generally limited to $250 million. The Company can limit its exposure to these guarantees\nby suspending the payment of claims for ASC customers that have not adequately funded the amount paid by the bank.\n•\nSeparate Accounts Assets - Certain Separate Accounts assets associated with the large case pensions business in the Corporate/Other segment represent\nfunds maintained as a contractual requirement to fund specific pension annuities that the Company has guaranteed. Minimum contractual obligations\nunderlying the guaranteed benefits in these Separate Accounts were approximately $941 million and $1.3 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively. See Note 1 ‘‘Significant Accounting Policies’’ for additional information on Separate Accounts. Contract holders assume all investment and\nmortality risk and are required to maintain Separate Accounts balances at or above a specified level. The level of required funds is a function of the risk\nunderlying the Separate Account’s investment strategy.

As a result, the Company was not required to maintain any additional liability for its related guarantees at\nDecember 31, 2022.\nLease Guarantees\nBetween 1995 and 1997, the Company sold or spun off a number of subsidiaries, including Bob’s Stores and Linens ‘n Things, each of which subsequently\nfiled for bankruptcy, and Marshalls. In many cases, when a former subsidiary leased a store, the Company provided a guarantee of the former subsidiary’s lease\nobligations for the initial lease term and any extension thereof pursuant to a renewal option provided for in the lease prior to the time of the disposition. When\nthe subsidiaries were disposed of and accounted for as discontinued operations, the Company’s guarantees remained in place, although each initial purchaser\nagreed to indemnify the Company for any lease obligations the Company was required to satisfy. If any of the purchasers or any of the former subsidiaries fail\nto make the required payments under a store lease, the Company could be required to satisfy those obligations, and any significant adverse impact of COVID-\n19 on such purchasers and/or former subsidiaries increases the risk that the Company will be required to satisfy those obligations. As of December 31, 2022,\nthe Company guaranteed 67 such store leases (excluding the lease guarantees related to Linens ‘n Things, which have been recorded as a liability on the\nconsolidated balance sheets), with the maximum remaining lease term extending through 2034.\nGuaranty Fund Assessments, Market Stabilization and Other Non-Voluntary Risk Sharing Pools\nUnder guaranty fund laws existing in all states, insurers doing business in those states can be assessed (in most states up to prescribed limits) for certain\nobligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants. The life and health insurance guaranty associations in which the Company\nparticipates that operate under these laws respond to insolvencies of long-term care insurers and life insurers as well as health insurers. The Company’s\nassessments generally are based on a formula relating to the Company’s health care premiums in the state compared to the premiums of other insurers. Certain\nstates allow assessments to be recovered over time as offsets to premium taxes. Some states have similar laws relating to HMOs and/or other payors such as\nnot-for-profit consumer-governed health plans established under the ACA.\nIn 2009, the Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner placed long-term care insurer Penn Treaty Network America Insurance Company and one of its subsidiaries\n(collectively, “Penn Treaty”) in rehabilitation, an intermediate action before insolvency, and subsequently petitioned a state court to convert the rehabilitation\ninto a liquidation.

CMS uses various payment mechanisms to allocate and adjust premium payments to the Company’s and other\ncompanies’ Medicare plans by considering the applicable health status of Medicare members as supported by information prepared, maintained and provided\nby providers. The Company collects claim and encounter data from providers and generally relies on providers to appropriately code their submissions to the\nCompany and document their medical records, including the diagnosis data submitted to the Company with claims. CMS pays increased premiums to Medicare\nAdvantage plans and Medicare PDP plans for members who have certain medical conditions identified with specific diagnosis codes. Federal regulators review\nand audit the providers’ medical records to determine whether those records support the related diagnosis codes that determine the members’ health status and\nthe resulting risk-adjusted premium payments to the Company. In that regard, CMS has instituted risk adjustment data validation (“RADV”) audits of various\nMedicare Advantage plans, including certain of the Company’s plans, to validate coding practices and supporting medical record documentation maintained by\nproviders and the resulting risk-adjusted premium payments to the plans. CMS may require the Company to refund premium payments if the Company’s risk-\nadjusted premiums are not properly supported by medical record data. The Office of the Inspector General of the HHS (the “OIG”) also is auditing the\nCompany’s risk adjustment-related data and that of other companies.

Under the revised methodology, among other things, CMS announced extrapolation of the error rate identified in the audit sample along with the\napplication of a process to account for errors in the government’s traditional fee-for-service Medicare program (“FFS Adjuster”). For contract years prior to\n2011, CMS did not extrapolate sample error rates to the entire contract, nor did CMS propose to apply a FFS adjuster. By applying the FFS Adjuster, Medicare\nAdvantage organizations would have been liable for repayments only to the extent that their extrapolated payment errors exceeded the error rate in Original\nMedicare, which could have impacted the extrapolated repayments to which Medicare Advantage organizations are subject. This revised contract-level audit\nmethodology increased the Company’s exposure to premium refunds to CMS based on incomplete medical records maintained by providers. In the RADV\naudit methodology CMS used from 2011-2013, CMS selected only a few of the Company’s Medicare Advantage contracts for various contract years for\ncontract-level RADV audits. In October 2018, CMS in the proposed rule (“Proposed Rule”) announced a new methodology for RADV audits targeting certain\nhealth conditions and members with many diagnostic conditions along with extrapolation for the error rates identified without use of a FFS Adjuster.

The Company’s\nsegments maintain separate financial information, and the Company’s chief operating decision maker (the “CODM”) evaluates the segments’ operating results\non a regular basis in deciding how to allocate resources among the segments and in assessing segment performance. The CODM evaluates the performance of\nthe Company’s segments based on adjusted operating income, which is defined as operating income (GAAP measure) excluding the impact of amortization of\nintangible assets and other items, if any, that neither relate to the ordinary course of the Company’s business nor reflect the Company’s underlying business\nperformance. See the reconciliation of consolidated operating income (GAAP measure) to consolidated adjusted operating income below for further context\nregarding the items excluded from operating income in determining adjusted operating income. The Company uses adjusted operating income as its principal\nmeasure of segment performance as it enhances the Company’s ability to compare past financial performance with current performance and analyze underlying\nbusiness performance and trends. Non-GAAP financial measures the Company discloses, such as consolidated adjusted operating income, should not be\nconsidered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nIn 2022, 2021 and 2020, revenues from the federal government accounted for 18%, 17% and 16%, respectively, of the Company’s consolidated total\nrevenues, primarily related to contracts with CMS for coverage of Medicare-eligible individuals within the Health Care Benefits segment.\n176\n\n\nThe following is a reconciliation of financial measures of the Company’s segments to the consolidated totals:\nIn millions\nHealth Care\nBenefits\nPharmacy \nServices \nRetail/\nLTC\nCorporate/\nOther\nIntersegment\nEliminations \nConsolidated\nTotals\n2022:\nRevenues from external customers\n$\n90,844  $\n157,787  $\n72,874  $\n124 \n$\n— \n$\n321,629 \nIntersegment revenues\n89 \n11,449 \n33,764 \n— \n(45,302)\n— \nNet investment income (loss)\n476 \n— \n(44)\n406 \n— \n838 \nTotal revenues\n91,409 \n169,236 \n106,594 \n530 \n(45,302)\n322,467 \n  Adjusted operating income (loss)\n5,984 \n7,356 \n6,705 \n(1,785)\n(728)\n17,532 \nDepreciation and amortization\n1,629 \n567 \n1,813 \n238 \n— \n4,247 \n2021:\nRevenues from external customers\n81,515 \n143,194 \n66,078 \n125 \n— \n290,912 \nIntersegment revenues",

Although intangible assets contribute to the Company’s revenue generation, the amortization of intangible assets does not\ndirectly relate to the underwriting of the Company’s insurance products, the services performed for the Company’s customers or the sale of the Company’s products or services. Additionally,\nintangible asset amortization expense typically fluctuates based on the size and timing of the Company’s acquisition activity. Accordingly, the Company believes excluding the amortization of\nintangible assets enhances the Company’s and investors’ ability to compare the Company’s past financial performance with its current performance and to analyze underlying business\nperformance and trends. Intangible asset amortization excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure represents the entire amount recorded within the Company’s GAAP financial\nstatements, and the revenue generated by the associated intangible assets has not been excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure. Intangible asset amortization is excluded from the\nrelated non-GAAP financial measure because the amortization, unlike the related revenue, is not affected by operations of any particular period unless an intangible asset becomes impaired or\nthe estimated useful life of an intangible asset is revised.\n(2)\nIn 2022, the office real estate optimization charges primarily relate to the abandonment of leased real estate and the related right-of-use assets and property and equipment in connection with the\nplanned reduction of corporate office real estate space in response to the Company’s new flexible work arrangement.

During 2022, the loss on assets held for sale also relates to the Commercial Business reporting unit within the Health Care Benefits segment. In March\n2022, the Company reached an agreement to sell its Thailand business, which was included in the Commercial Business reporting unit. At that time, a portion of the Commercial Business\ngoodwill was specifically allocated to the Thailand business.

The Company’s\nsystem of internal control over financial reporting is enhanced by periodic reviews by the Company’s internal auditors, written policies and procedures and a\nwritten Code of Conduct adopted by CVS Health Corporation’s Board of Directors, applicable to all employees of the Company. In addition, the Company has\nan internal Disclosure Committee, comprised of management from each functional area within the Company, which performs a separate review of disclosure\ncontrols and procedures. There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system of internal control over financial reporting.\nBased on management’s assessment, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective and provides reasonable\nassurance that assets are safeguarded and that the financial records are reliable for preparing financial statements as of December 31, 2022.\nErnst & Young LLP, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, is appointed by CVS Health Corporation’s Board of Directors and ratified\nby CVS Health Corporation’s stockholders. They were engaged to render an opinion regarding the fair presentation of the Company’s consolidated financial\nstatements as well as conducting an audit of internal control over financial reporting. Their reports included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K are based upon audits\nconducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).\nChanges in internal control over financial reporting\nThere has been no change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of\nRule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 that occurred during the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2022 that has materially affected, or is reas",

Except as otherwise required by law, or by the provisions of the preferred stock or the preference stock, or provided in any resolution adopted by the\nCVS Health board of directors (the “board”) with respect to any subsequently created class or series of shares of CVS Health, the holders of the shares of\ncommon stock exclusively possess all voting power. The Charter precludes cumulative voting in the election of directors. The Charter provides for a majority\nvote standard for uncontested elections of directors, and a plurality of votes standard for contested elections of directors. Subject to any rights of any\noutstanding series of preferred stock or preference stock, (i) the holders of shares of common stock are entitled to such dividends as may be declared from time\nto time by the board from funds available therefor, (ii) no dividends may be declared, paid, or set aside for payment on shares of common stock unless full\ncumulative dividends are paid on any outstanding preference stock and any other preferred stock issued and outstanding at such time that is designated to have\nsuch dividend preference and (iii) upon dissolution the holders of shares of common stock are entitled to receive pro rata all assets of CVS Health available for\ndistribution to such holders, subject to any liquidation preferences designated to any preferred stock or preference stock that may be issued and outstanding at\nsuch time of liquidation.\nNo Preemptive Rights\nThe Charter provides that no holder of any shares of CVS Health of any class or series may have any preemptive right to purchase or subscribe to any\nshares of CVS Health or any security convertible into shares of CVS Health of any class or series.\nProvisions Relating to Amendments to CVS Health’s Charter and By-Laws\nUnder Delaware law, stockholders have the right to adopt, amend or repeal the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of a corporation. However,\nDelaware law requires that any amendment to the Charter also be approved by the board. Under Delaware law, unless a higher vote is required in a\ncorporation’s certificate of incorporation, amendments to the corporation’s certificate of incorporation will be adopted upon receiving at a properly convened\nmeeting the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by all stockholders entitled to vote thereon, and if any class or series is entitled to vote thereon as a\nclass, the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast in each class vote.\nIn addition, the By-Laws may be amended by the board with respect to all matters not exclusively",

New entrants into the\nmarketplace, as well as consolidation within the industry, have contributed to and are expected to intensify the competitive environment. In addition, the rapid\npace of change as the industry evolves towards a consumer-focused retail marketplace, including Insurance Exchanges, and the increased use of technology to\ninteract with members, providers and customers, increase the risks the Company faces from new entrants and disruptive actions by existing competitors\ncompared to prior periods.\nThe Company believes that the significant factors that distinguish competing health plans include the perceived overall quality (including accreditation\nstatus), quality of service, comprehensiveness of coverage, cost (including premium rates, provider discounts and member out-of-pocket costs), product\ndesign, financial stability and ratings, breadth and quality of provider networks, ability to offer different provider network options, providers available in such\nnetworks, and quality of member support and care management programs. The Company believes that it is competitive on each of these factors. The\nCompany’s ability to increase the number of persons covered by its health plans or to increase Health Care Benefits segment revenues is affected by its ability\nto differentiate itself from its competitors on these factors. Competition may also affect the availability of services from providers, including primary care\nphysicians, specialists and hospitals.\nInsured products compete with local and regional health care benefits plans, health care benefits and other plans sponsored by other large commercial health\ncare benefit insurance companies, health system owned health plans, new entrants into the marketplace and numerous for-profit and not-for-profit\norganizations operating under licenses from the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Ass",

To help improve clinical outcomes for members and clients, the Company conducts ongoing, independent reviews of\nall drugs, including those appearing on the formularies and generic equivalent products. Many of the Company’s clients choose to adopt a template formulary\noffering as part of their plan design. PBM clients are given capabilities to offer real time benefits information for a member’s specific plan design, provided\ndigitally at the point of prescribing, at the CVS pharmacy and directly to members.\nRetail Pharmacy Network Management Services\nThe Company maintains a national network of approximately 66,000 retail pharmacies, consisting of approximately 40,000 chain pharmacies (which include\nCVS pharmacy locations) and approximately 26,000 independent pharmacies, in the United States, including Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, Guam and\nthe U.S. Virgin Islands. When a customer fills a prescription in a retail pharmacy, the pharmacy sends prescription data electronically to the Company from the\npoint-of-sale. This data interfaces with the Company’s proprietary prescription management systems, which verify relevant plan member data and eligibility,\nwhile also performing a drug utilization review to help evaluate clinical appropriateness and safety and confirming that the pharmacy will receive payment for\nthe prescription.\nMail Order Pharmacy Services\nThe Pharmacy Services segment operates mail order dispensing pharmacies in the United States.

The Biden administration most recently renewed\nthe PHE on January 11, 2023 and has indicated that they intend for the PHE to expire on May 11, 2023. The Families First Coronavirus Response Act (the\n“Families First Act”) and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) were enacted in March 2020. Each of the Families First\nAct and the CARES Act requires the Company to provide coverage for COVID-19 related medical services, in many cases without member cost-sharing, in its\nInsured Health Care Benefits products.\nThe CARES Act also provides relief funding to providers to reimburse them for health care related expenses incurred in preventing, preparing for and/or\nresponding to COVID-19 (provided no other source is obligated to reimburse those expenses) or lost health care related revenues that are attributable to\nCOVID-19. Under the CARES Act, the Company receives reimbursement for uninsured patients in connection with COVID-19 testing and vaccination as well\nas monoclonal antibody treatment. Aside from such reimbursement, the Company has not requested any funding under the CARES Act. However, in the\nsecond quarter of 2020, the Company received $43 million from the CARES Act provider relief fund, all of which was returned to the HHS during the second\nquarter of 2020.\nThe CARES Act also allows for the deferral of the payment of the employer share of Social Security taxes effective March 27, 2020 by permitting them to\nremit the associated payments in two equal installments on or about December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2022.

Several of these are subject to judicial challenges.

Employees must apply and be approved for a reasonable accommodation in order to\nbe exempt from the vaccination requirement.\nAdditionally, in January 2022, the HHS announced that commercial health insurers must cover the costs of up to eight rapid COVID-19 OTC test kits per\nindividual per 30-day period.

These\nrequirements may increase benefit costs in those businesses and jurisdictions, and may increase revenues in our retail business.

Potential sanctions for violating these\nlaws include recoupment or reduction of government reimbursement amounts, civil penalties, treble damages, and exclusion from participation in government\nhealth care programs. Such laws include the federal False Claims Act (the “False Claims Act”), the federal anti-kickback statute (the “AKS”), state false claims\nacts and anti-kickback statutes in most states, the federal “Stark Law” and related state laws. In particular, the False Claims Act prohibits intentionally\nsubmitting, conspiring to submit, or causing to be submitted, false claims, records, or statements to the federal government, or intentionally failing to return\noverpayments, in connection with reimbursement by federal government programs. In addition, any claim for government reimbursement also violates the\nFalse Claims Act where it results from a violation of the AKS.\nBoth federal and state false claims laws permit private individuals to file qui tam or “whistleblower” lawsuits on behalf of the federal or state government.\nParticipants in the health and related benefits industry, including the Company, frequently are subject to actions under the False Claims Act or similar state\nlaws. The federal Stark Law generally prohibits physicians from referring Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries for certain services, including outpatient\nprescription drugs, to any entity with which the physician, or an immediate family member of the physician, has a financial relationship. The Stark Law further\nprohibits the entity receiving a prohibited referral from presenting a claim for reimbursement by Medicare or Medicaid for services furnished pursuant to the\nprohibited referral.

If a Medicare Advantage or Medicare Part D contract pays minimum MLR rebates for three consecutive years, it will become ineligible to\nenroll new members. If a Medicare Advantage or Medicare Part D contract pays such rebates for five consecutive years, it will be terminated by CMS. Due to\npotential lower utilization of medical services by Medicare beneficiaries during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is possible certain Medicare Advantage contracts\nmay not meet the 85% MLR for consecutive years.\nThe Company’s Medicare Advantage and PDP products are heavily regulated by CMS. The regulations and contractual requirements applicable to the\nCompany and other private participants in Medicare programs are complex, expensive to comply with and subject to change. For example, the Medicare\nAdvantage Overpayment Rule, issued in 2014, implemented the ACA requirements that Medicare Advantage and PDP plans report and refund to CMS\noverpayments that those plans receive from CMS. Failure to notify overpayments to CMS could result in liability under the False Claims Act. The precise\ninterpretation, impact and legality of this rule are subject to pending litigation. Payments the Company receives from CMS for its Medicare Advantage and Part\nD businesses also are subject to risk adjustment based on the health status of the individuals enrolled.

The new safe harbors are (i) for rebates which are passed on to\nthe patient at the point of sale and (ii) for flat service fee payments made to PBMs which cannot be tied to the list prices of drugs. It is unclear whether the\nRebate Rule will be enforceable, whether pharmaceutical companies will respond by reducing list prices, whether list prices in the private market may also be\nreduced, and what the resulting impact will be to PBMs or the Company. The Pharmaceutical Care Management Association (the “PCMA”), which represents\nPBMs, has filed a suit in an effort to block the Rebate Rule, claiming that the Rebate Rule would lead to higher premiums in Medicare Part D and was adopted\nin an unlawful manner. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Act of 2021 delays the effective date of the rebate rule to January 2026, and the Inflation Reduction Act,\nenacted in August 2022, further delays the Rebate Rule through 2032.\nIn July 2022, the 2% Medicare sequester required by the Budget Control Act of 2011 resumed, meaning that Medicare claims incur a 2% reduction in Medicare\npayment.

It is also possible that Congress may\nconsider changes to Medicare Advantage payment policies due to recent recommendations by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission and to reduce the\npotential added cost burden of costly new benefits, or policies that impact drug pricing such as price controls and inflationary rebates applied to pharmaceutical\nmanufacturers.\nIt is not possible to predict the outcome of such regulatory or Congressional activity, any of which could materially and adversely affect the Company.\nMedicare Audits - CMS regularly audits the Company’s performance to determine its compliance with CMS’s regulations and its contracts with CMS and to\nassess the quality of services it provides to Medicare Advantage and PDP beneficiaries. For example, CMS conducts risk adjustment data validation (“RADV”)\naudits of a subset of Medicare Advantage contracts for each contract year. Since 2011, C",

The OIG also is auditing the Company’s risk adjustment\ndata and that of other companies, and the Company expects CMS and the OIG to continue auditing risk adjustment data. The Company also has received Civil\nInvestigative Demands (“CIDs”) from, and provided documents and information to, the Civil Division of the DOJ in connection with a current investigation of\nits patient chart review processes in connection with risk adjustment data submissions under Parts C and D of the Medicare program.\nOn January 30, 2023, CMS released the final rule concerning Part C contract-level Risk Adjustment Data Validation Audits (the “RADV Audit Rule”). The\nRADV Audit Rule eliminated the application of a fee-for-service adjuster (“FFS Adjuster”) in contract-level RADV audits but continued the use of\nextrapolation in such audits of Medicare Advantage organizations. The FFS Adjuster that was announced in 2012 was to be used by CMS to determine a\npermissible level of payment error. By applying the FFS Adjuster, Medicare Advantage organizations would have been liable for repayments only to the extent\nthat their extrapolated payment errors exceeded the error rate in Original Medicare, which could have impacted the extrapolated repayments to which Medicare\nAdvantage organizations are subject. Under the RADV Audit Rule, CMS, in most cases, will conduct RADV audits for payment year 2018 and subsequent\npayment years using extrapolation without the application of a FFS Adjuster. The RADV Audit Rule may have potential adverse effects, which could be\nmaterial, on the Company’s operating results, financial condition, and cash flows. CMS also has announced that it will not conduct RADV audits on all\ncontracts; instead, it will only audit contracts it believes are at the highest risk for overpayments based on its statistical modeling.\nMedicare Star Ratings - A portion of each Medicare Advantage plan’s reimbursement is tied to the plan’s “star ratings.” The star rating system considers a\nvariety of measures adopted by CMS, including quality of preventative services, chronic illness management, compliance and overall customer satisfaction.\nOnly Medicare Advantage plans with an overall star rating of 4 or more stars (out of 5 stars) are eligible for a quality bonus in their basic premium rates. As a\nresult, the Company’s Medicare Advantage plans’ operating results in 2023 and going forward will be significantly affected by their star ratings. The\nCompany’s star ratings and past performance scores are adversely affected by any compliance issues that may have arisen each year in its Medicare operations.\nCMS released the Company’s 2023 star ratings in October 2022. The Company’s 2023 star ratings will be used to determine which of its Medicare Advantage\nplans have ratings of 4 stars or higher and qualify for bonu",

Based on the 2023 star ratings, the percentage of the Company’s Medicare\nAdvantage members in 4 or more stars plans is expected to drop to 21% (based on enrollment and contract affiliation at December 31, 2022), as compared to\n87%\n21\n\n\nbased on the 2022 star ratings. The main driver of this decrease was a 1 star decrease in the Company’s Aetna National PPO, which dropped from 4.5 to 3.5\nstars, while many of the Company’s other plans remain rated at 4 or more stars. The decrease in the star rating for the Aetna National PPO will mean that it will\nno longer be eligible for CMS’ quality bonus payments related to 2024, though the Company’s contract diversification efforts, which will partially mitigate\ncertain adverse impacts associated with the decrease in the star rating for the Aetna National PPO, have received regulatory approval. CMS also gives PDPs\nstar ratings that affect each PDP’s enrollment. Medicare Advantage and PDP plans that are rated less than 3 stars for three consecutive years are subject to\ncontract termination by CMS. CMS continues to revise its star ratings system to make it harder to achieve 4 or more stars. There can be no assurances that the\nCompany will be successful in maintaining or improving its star ratings in future years. Accordingly, the Company’s Medicare Advantage plans may not\ncontinue to be or become eligible for full level quality bonuses, which could adversely affect the benefits such plans can offer, reduce membership and/or\nreduce profit margins.\nMedicare Payment Rates - In April 2022, CMS issued its final notice detailing final 2023 Medicare Advantage payment rates. Final 2023 Medicare\nAdvantage rates resulted in an expected average increase in revenue for the Medicare Advantage industry of 5.00%, excluding the CMS estimate of Medicare\nAdvantage risk score trend. On February 1, 2023, CMS issued an advance notice detailing proposed 2024 Medicare Advantage payment rates. The 2024\nMedicare Advantage rates, if finalized as proposed, will result in an expected average decrease in revenue for the Medicare Advantage industry of 2.27%,\nexcluding the CMS estimate of Medicare Advantage risk score trend. CMS intends to publish the final 2024 rate announcement no later than April 3, 2023. The\nfederal government may seek to impose restrictions on the configuration of pharmacy or other provider networks for Medicare Advantage and/or PDP plans, or\notherwise restrict the ability of these plans to alter benefits, negotiate prices or establish other terms to improve affordability or maintain viability of products.\nThe Company currently believes that the payments it has received and will receive in the near term are adequate to justify the Company’s continued\nparticipation in the Medicare Advantage and PDP programs, although there are economic and political pressures to continue to reduce spending on the\nprogram, and this outlook could change.\n340B Drug Pricing Program – The 340B Drug Prici",

In 2020, a number of pharmaceutical manufacturers\nbegan programs that limited Covered Entities’ participation in the program through contract pharmacies arrangements. In May 2021, HRSA sent enforcement\nletters to multiple manufacturers to curb these practices. In September 2021, HRSA forwarded the enforcement actions to the OIG for potential imposition of\ncivil monetary penalties. Those enforcement actions are currently subject to ongoing litigation. In November 2022, HRSA issued proposed rules that would\noverhaul the 340B Drug Pricing Programs Administrative Dispute Resolution process. The revisions are designed to make the process more accessible by\nmaking it more expeditious and less formal, as well as more equitable by requiring fewer resources to participate. A reduction in Covered Entities’ participation\nin contract pharmacy arrangements, as a result of the pending enforcement actions or otherwise, a reduction in the use of the Company’s administrative\nservices by Covered Entities, or a reduction in drug manufacturers’ participation in the program could materially and adversely affect the Company.\nAnti-Remuneration Laws - Federal law prohibits, among other things, an entity from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving, subject\nto certain exceptions and “safe harbors,” any remuneration to induce the referral of individuals or the purchase, lease or order of items or services for which\npayment may be made under Medicare, Medicaid or certain other federal and state health care programs. A number of states have similar laws, some of which\nare not limited to services paid for with government funds. Sanctions for violating these federal and state anti-remuneration laws may include imprisonment,\ncriminal and civil fines, and exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state government-sponsored health care programs.\nCompanies involved in public health care programs such as Medicare and/or Medicaid are required to maintain compliance programs to detect and deter fraud,\nwaste and abuse, and are often the subject of fraud, waste and abuse investigations and audits. The Company has invested significant resources to comply with\nMedicare and Medicaid program standards. Ongoing vigorous law enforcement and the highly technical regulatory scheme mean that the Company’s\ncompliance efforts in this area will continue to require significant resources.\nAntitrust and Unfair Competition - The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) investigates and prosecutes practices that are “unfair trade practices” or\n“unfair methods of competition.” Numerous lawsuits have been filed throughout the United States against pharmaceutical manufacturers, retail pharmacies\nand/or PBMs under various federal a",

In addition to PII, the Company uses and discloses de-identified data for analytical\nand other purposes when permitted. Additionally, there are industry standards for handling credit card data known as the Payment Card Industry Data Security\nStandard, which are a set of requirements designed to help ensure that entities that process, store or transmit credit card information maintain a secure\nenvironment. Certain states have incorporated these requirements into state laws or enacted other requirements relating to the use and/or disclosure of PII.\nThe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and the regulations issued thereunder (collectively, “HIPAA”), as further modified by\nthe American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (“ARRA”) impose extensive requirements on the way in which health plans, providers, health care\nclearinghouses (known as “covered entities”) and their business associates use, disclose and safeguard protected health information (“PHI”). Further, ARRA\nrequires the Company and other covered entities to report any breaches of PHI to impacted individuals and to the HHS and to notify the media in any states\nwhere 500 or more people are impacted by the unauthorized release or use of or access to PHI. Criminal penalties and civil sanctions may be imposed for\nfailing to comply with HIPAA standards.

The HITECH Act also extended HIPAA privacy and security requirements and penalties directly to business associates. HHS has begun to audit health\nplans, providers and other parties to enforce HIPAA compliance, including with respect to data security.\nIn addition to HIPAA, state health privacy laws apply to the extent they are more protective of individual privacy than is HIPAA, including laws that place\nstricter controls on the release of information relating to specific diseases or conditions and requirements to notify members of unauthorized release or use of or\naccess to PHI. States also have adopted regulations to implement provisions of the Financial Modernization Act of 1999 (also known as the Gramm-Leach-\nBliley Act (“GLBA”)) which generally require insurers, including health insurers, to provide customers with notice regarding how their non-public personal\nhealth and financial information is used and the opportunity to “opt out” of certain disclosures before the insurer shares such information with a non-affiliated\nthird party. Like HIPAA, GLBA sets a “floor” standard, allowing states to adopt more stringent requirements governing privacy protection. Complying with\nadditional state requirements requires us to make additional investments beyond those the Company has made to comply with HIPAA and GLBA.\nThe Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 encourages organizations to share cyber threat indicators with the federal government and, among other\nthings, directs HHS to develop a set of voluntary cybersecurity best practices for organizations in the health care industry. In addition, states have begun to\nenact more comprehensive privacy laws and regulations addressing consumer rights to data access, deletion, protection or transparency, such as the California\nConsumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”). States also are starting to issue regulations and proposed regulations specifically related to cybersecurity, such as the\nregulations issued by the New York Department of Financial Services. Complying with conflicting cybersecurity regulations, which may differ from state to\nstate, requires significant resources. In addition, differing approaches to state privacy and/or cyber-security regulation and varying enforcement philosophies\nmay materially and adversely affect the Company’s ability to standardize its products and services across state lines. Widely-reported large scale commercial\ndata breaches in the United States and abroad increase the likelihood that additional data security legislation will be considered by additional states.

These standards may differ from, and be\nmore stringent than, HIPAA.\nConsumer Protection Laws - The federal government has many consumer protection laws, such as the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Federal Postal\nService Act and the Consumer Product Safety Act. Most states also have similar consumer protection laws and a growing number of states regulate subscription\nprograms. In addition, the federal government and most states have adopted laws and/or regulations requiring places of public accommodation, health care\nservices and other goods and\n23\n\n\nservices to be accessible to people with disabilities. These consumer protection and accessibility laws and regulations have been the basis for investigations,\nlawsuits and multistate settlements relating to, among other matters, the marketing of loyalty programs, and health care products and services, pricing accuracy,\nexpired front store products, financial incentives provided by drug manufacturers to pharmacies in connection with therapeutic interchange programs,\ndisclosures related to how personal data is used and protected and the accessibility of goods and services to people with disabilities. As a result of the\nCompany’s direct-to-consumer activities, including mobile and web-based solutions offered to members and to other consumers, the Company also is subject\nto federal and state regulations applicable to electronic communications and to other general consumer protection laws and regulations.

Since then,\nCongress has extended and modified the Medicare sequester a number of times. The CARES Act temporarily suspended the Medicare sequester and\nextended mandatory sequestration to 2030. In July 2022, the 2% Medicare sequester resumed.

These contracts with the OPM and applicable government regulations establish\npremium rating arrangements for this program. In addition to other requirements, such as the Transparency in Coverage Rule note above, OPM regulations\nrequire that community-rated FEHB plans meet a FEHB program-specific minimum MLR by plan code and market. Managing to these rules is complicated by\nthe simultaneous application of the minimum MLR standards and associated premium rebate requirements of the ACA. The Company also has a contractual\narrangement with carriers for the FEHB program, such as the BlueCross BlueShield Association, to provide pharmacy services to federal employees, postal\nworkers, annuitants, and their dependents under the Government-wide Service Benefit Plan, as authorized by the FEHB Act and as part of the FEHB program.\nAdditionally, the Company manages certain FEHB plans on a “cost-plus” basis.

The Company has taken steps to be able to continue to serve customers in the European Economic Area following the\nUnited Kingdom’s exit from the EU (“Brexit”).\nThe Company’s international operations are subject to different, and sometimes more stringent, legal and regulatory requirements, which vary widely by\njurisdiction, including anti-corruption laws; economic sanctions laws; various privacy, insurance, tax, tariff and trade laws and regulations; corporate\ngovernance, privacy, data protection (including the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation which began to apply across the EU during 2018), data mining,\ndata transfer, labor and employment, intellectual property, consumer protection and investment laws and regulations; discriminatory licensing procedures;\ncompulsory cessions of reinsurance; required localization of records and funds; higher premium and income taxes; limitations on dividends and repatriation of\ncapital; and requirements for local participation in an insurer’s ownership. In addition, the presence of operations in foreign countries potentially increases the\nCompany’s exposure to the anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-money laundering provisions of U.S. law, including the FCPA, and corresponding foreign\nlaws, including the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 (the “UK Bribery Act”).\nAnti-Corruption Laws - The FCPA prohibits offering, promising or authorizing others to give anything of value to a foreign government official to obtain or\nretain business or otherwise secure a business advantage. The Company also is subject to applicable anti-corruption laws of the jurisdictions in which it\noperates. In many countries outside the United States, health care professionals are employed by the government. Therefore, the Company’s dealings with them\nare subject to regulation under the FCPA. Violations of the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions as well as\nother penalties, and there continues to be a heightened level of FCPA enforcement activity by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and\nthe DOJ. The UK Bribery Act is an anti-corruption law that is broader in scope than the FCPA and applies to all companies with a nexus to the United\nKingdom.

In general, these limitations apply to certain customer\nsegments and limit the Company’s ability to set prices for new or renewing groups, or both, based on specific characteristics of the group or the group’s prior\nclaim experience. In some states, these laws and regulations restrict the Company’s ability to price for the risk it assumes and/or reflect reasonable costs in the\nCompany’s pricing.\nThe ACA expanded the premium rate review process by, among other things, requiring the Company’s Commercial Insured rates to be reviewed for\n“reasonableness” at either the state or the federal level. HHS established a federal premium rate review process that generally applies to proposed premium rate\nincreases equal to or exceeding a federally (or lower state) specified threshold. HHS’s rate review process imposes additional public disclosure requirements as\nwell as additional review on filings requesting premium rate increases equal to or exceeding this “reasonableness” threshold. These combined state and federal\nreview requirements may prevent, further delay or otherwise affect the Company’s ability to price for the risk it assumes, which could adversely affect its\nMBRs and operating results, particularly during periods of increased utilization of medical services and/or medical cost trend or when such utilization and/or\ntrend exceeds the Company’s projections.\nThe ACA also specifies minimum MLRs of 85% for large group Commercial products and 80% for individual and small group Commercial products. Because\nthe ACA minimum MLRs are structured as “floors” for many of their requirements, states have the latitude to enact more stringent rules governing these\nrestrictions. For Commercial products, states have and may adopt higher minimum MLR requirements, use more stringent definitions of “medical loss ratio,”\nincorporate minimum MLR requirements into prospective premium rate filings, require prior approval of premium rates or impose other requirements related\nto minimum MLR. Minimum MLR requirements and similar actions further limit the level of margin the Company can earn in its Insured Commercial\nproducts while leaving the Company exposed to medical costs that are higher than those reflected in its pricing. The Company also may be subject to\nsignificant fines, penalties, premium refunds and litigation if it fails to comply with minimum MLR laws and regulations.\nIn addition, the Company requested increases in its premium rates in its Commercial Health Care Benefits business for 2023 and expects to request future\nincreases in those rates in order to adequately price for projected medical cost trends, required expansions of coverage and rating limits, and significant\nassessments, fees and taxes imposed by the federal and state governments, including as a result of the ACA.

These rate increases may be significant and thus heighten the risks of\nadverse publicity, adverse regulatory action and adverse selection and the likelihood that the Company’s requested premium rate increases will be denied,\nreduced or delayed, which could lead to operating margin compression.\nMany of the laws and regulations governing the Company’s pricing and underwriting practices also limit the differentials in premium rates insurers and other\ncarriers may charge between new and renewal business, and/or between groups based on differing characteristics. They may also require that carriers disclose\nto customers the basis on which the carrier establishes new business and renewal premium rates and limit the ability of a carrier to terminate customers’\ncoverage.\nMedicaid Regulation - The Company is seeking to substantially grow its Medicaid, dual eligible and dual eligible special needs plan businesses over the next\nseveral years. As a result, the Company also is increasing its exposure to changes in government policy with respect to and/or regulation of the various\nMedicaid, dual eligible and dual eligible special needs plan programs in which the Company participates, including changes in the amounts payable to the\nCompany under those programs.\nIn addition to a quality rating system that applies to Medicaid and Managed Medicaid plans, federal regulations give states the option to choose to establish a\nminimum MLR of at least 85% for their Managed Medicaid plans, including those offered by the Company. Regardless of whether a state establishes a\nminimum MLR, it must use plan-reported MLR data to set future\n30\n\n\npayment rates for managed care, so that its plans will “reasonably achieve” an MLR of at least 85%. For Managed Medicaid products, states may use more\nstringent definitions of “medical loss ratio”, use discretion in choosing a quantitative standard for determining provider network adequacy, or impose other\nrequirements related to minimum MLR. Minimum MLR requirements and similar actions further limit the level of margin the Company can earn in its Insured\nMedicaid products while leaving the Company exposed to medical costs that are higher than those reflected in its pricing. The Company also may be subject to\nsignificant fines, penalties, premium refunds and litigation if it fails to comply with minimum MLR laws and regulations.\nStates continue to consider Medicaid expansion; however, to date 12 states have not expanded, which will drop to 11 states once South Dakota’s expansion\ntakes effect in July 2023.

While historically the Company has ultimately\nrecovered more than half of guaranty fund assessments through statutorily permitted premium tax offsets, significant increases in assessments could lead to\nlegislative and/or regulatory actions that limit future offsets.\nLaws and Regulations Related to the Pharmacy Services Segment\nIn addition to the laws and regulations discussed above that may affect multiple segments of the Company’s business, the Company is subject to federal, state\nand local statutes and regulations governing the operation of its Pharmacy Services segment specifically. Among these are the following:\nPBM Laws and Regulation - Legislation and/or regulations seeking to regulate PBM activities in a comprehensive manner have been proposed or enacted in a\nmajority of states. This legislation could adversely affect the Company’s ability to conduct business on commercially reasonable terms in states where the\nlegislation is in effect and the Company’s ability to standardize its PBM products and services across state lines. In addition, certain quasi-regulatory\norganizations, including the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy and the National Council of Insurance Legislators, have issued model regulations or\nmay propose future regulations concerning PBMs and/or PBM activities. Similarly, credentialing organizations such as URAC have established voluntary\nstandards regarding PBM, mail order pharmacy and/or specialty pharmacy activities. While the actions of these quasi-regulatory or standard-setting\norganizations do not have the force of law, they may influence states to adopt their requirements or recommendations and influence client requirements for\nPBM, mail order pharmacy and/or specialty pharmacy services. Moreover, any standards established by these organizations could also impact the Company’s\nhealth plan clients and/or the services provided to those clients and/or the Company’s health plans.\nThe Company’s PBM activities also are regulated directly and indirectly at the federal and state levels, including being subject to the False Claims Act and state\nfalse claims acts and the AKS and state anti-kickback laws. These laws and regulations govern, and proposed legislation and regulations may govern and/or\nfurther restrict, critical PBM practices, including disclosure, receipt and retention of rebates and other payments received from pharmaceutical manufacturers;\nuse of, administration of and/or changes to drug formularies, maximum allowable cost (“MAC”) list pricing, average wholesale prices (“AWP”) and/or clinical\nprograms; the offering to plan sponsors of pricing tha",

However, state departments of insurance are increasing their oversight of PBM activities due to\nlegislation passing in a number of states requiring PBMs to register or obtain a license with the department, including through market conduct examinations\nand other audits our licensed entities. In addition, rulemaking is either underway or has already taken place in a number of states with the areas of focus\nincluding licensure requirements, pharmacy reimbursement, network design, cost sharing and pharmacy audits - most of which fall under the state insurance\ncode.\n32\n\n\nPharmacy Network Access Legislation - Medicare Part D and a majority of states now have some form of legislation affecting the Company’s (and its health\nplans’ and its health plan clients’) ability to limit access to a pharmacy provider network or remove pharmacy network providers. For example, certain “any\nwilling provider” legislation may require the Company or its clients to admit a nonparticipating pharmacy if such pharmacy is willing and able to meet the\nplan’s price and other applicable terms and conditions for network participation. These laws could negatively affect the services and economic benefits\nachievable through a limited pharmacy provider network. Also, a majority of states now have some form of legislation affecting the Company’s ability (and the\nCompany’s and its client health plans’ ability) to conduct audits of network pharmacies regarding claims submitted to the Company for payment. These laws\ncould negatively affect the Company’s ability to recover overpayments of claims submitted by network pharmacies that the Company identifies through\npharmacy audits.

MAC methodology is a common cost management practice used by private and public payors (including CMS) to pay pharmacies for\ndispensing generic prescription drugs. MAC prices specify the allowable reimbursement by a PBM for a particular strength and dosage of a generic drug that is\navailable from multiple manufacturers but sold at different prices. State legislation can regulate the disclosure of MAC prices and MAC price methodologies,\nthe kinds of drugs that a PBM can pay for at a MAC price, and the rights of pharmacies to appeal a MAC price established by a PBM. These laws could\nnegatively affect the Company’s ability to establish MAC prices for generic drugs. Additionally, some states have passed legislation that would restrict certain\ntypes of retroactive reconciliation or recoupment from pharmacies in the network or create a reimbursement benchmark mandate, such as the national average\ndrug acquisition cost and/or the wholesale acquisition cost (“WAC”), plus a set dispensing fee, for pharmacies in the network.\nFormulary and Plan Design Regulation - A number of government entities regulate the administration of prescription drug benefits. HHS regulates how\nMedicare Part D formularies are developed and administered, including requiring the inclusion of all drugs in certain classes and categories, subject to limited\nexceptions. Under the ACA, CMS imposes drug coverage requirements for health plans required to cover essential health benefits, including plans offered\nthrough federal or state Public Exchanges. Additionally, the NAIC and health care accreditation agencies like NCQA and URAC have developed model acts\nand standards for formulary development that are often incorporated into government requirements. Many states regulate the scope of prescription drug\ncoverage, as well as the delivery channels to receive prescriptions, for insurers, MCOs and Medicaid managed care plans. The increasing government\nregulation of formularies could significantly affect the Company’s ability to develop and administer formularies, pharmacy networks and other plan design\nfeatures. Similarly, some states prohibit health plan sponsors from implementing certain restrictive pharmacy benefit plan design features. This regulation could\nlimit or preclude (i) limited networks, (ii) a requirement to use particular providers, (iii) copayment differentials among providers and (iv) formulary tiering\npractices.\nLaws and Regulations Related to the Retail/LTC Segment\nIn addition to the laws and regulations discussed above that may affect multiple segments of the Company’s business, the Company is subject to federal, state\nand local statutes and regulations governing the operation of its Retail/LTC segment specifically.

If there is a rise in infection rates or the development of new variants or viruses, we may have to re-institute, extend or expand these\ninitiatives, which could adversely impact our businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition.

In addition, government-imposed limitations on Medicare and Medicaid\nreimbursements to health plans and providers have caused the private sector to bear a greater share of increasing health care and other benefits costs over time,\nand future amendments to the ACA that increase the uninsured population may amplify this issue. Other factors that affect our health care and other benefit\ncosts include epidemics or other pandemics, changes as a result of the ACA, changes to the ACA and other changes in the regulatory environment, the\nevolution toward a consumer driven business model, new technologies, influenza-related health care costs (which may be substantial and higher than we\nexpected), clusters of high-cost cases, health care\n37\n\n\nprovider and member fraud, and numerous other factors that are or may be beyond our control.

Our medical cost management programs may not be successful and may have a smaller impact on health care and benefit costs than we\nexpect. The factors described above may adversely affect our ability to predict and manage health care and other benefit costs, which can adversely affect our\ncompetitiveness and operating results.\nFurthermore, if we are not able to accurately and promptly anticipate and detect medical cost trends or accurately estimate the cost of incurred but not yet\nreported claims or reported claims that have not been paid, our ability to take timely corrective actions to limit future health care costs and reflect our current\nbenefit cost experience in our pricing process may be limited, which would further amplify the extent of any adverse impact on our operating results.

During the second quarter,\nCOVID-19 testing and treatment costs persisted, however at levels significantly lower than those observed during the first quarter. Beginning in the third\nquarter of 2021, medical costs once again increased primarily driven by the spread of emerging new variants of COVID-19, which resulted in increased testing\nand treatment costs throughout the remainder of the year.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the impact of COVID-19 within the Health Care Benefits segment has generally stabilized as a result of the\nCompany’s ability to capture COVID-19 related medical costs in pricing.\nRetail/LTC Segment\nDuring March 2020, the Company experienced increased prescription volume due to the greater use of 90-day prescriptions and early refills of maintenance\nmedications, as well as increased front store volume as consumers prepared for the COVID-19 pandemic. Beginning in the second quarter and continuing\nthroughout the remainder of the year, the Company experienced reduced customer traffic in its retail pharmacies and MinuteClinic locations due to shelter-in-\nplace orders as well as reduced new therapy prescriptions and decreased long-term care prescription volume as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\naddition, the Company incurred incremental operating expenses associated with the Company’s COVID-19 pandemic response efforts and waived fees\nassociated with prescription home delivery and associated front store products. During 2020, the Company also played a key role in supporting the local\ncommunities in which it operates through the administration of diagnostic testing at its CVS pharmacy locations, as well as in long-term care facilities, at\ncommunity-based testing sites in underserved areas and through its Return Ready\nsolution. The Company also began administering COVID-19 vaccinations\nin long-term care facilities during December 2020.\nDuring the first quarter of 2021, the Company experienced reduced customer traffic in its retail pharmacies, which reflected the impact of a weaker cough, cold\nand flu season, while it administered the highest quarterly volume of COVID-19 diagnostic tests. The Company began administering COVID-19 vaccines in its\nretail pharmacies during February 2021. During the second quarter, the segment generated earnings from COVID-19 vaccines and saw improved customer\ntraffic as vaccinated customers began more actively shopping in CVS locations. During the third and fourth quarters, emerging new variants drove the\ncontinued administration of COVID-19 vaccinations (including boosters) and diagnostic testing, while the segment also generated earnings from the sale of\nover-the-counter (“OTC”",

Although intangible assets contribute to the Company’s revenue generation, the amortization of intangible assets does not\ndirectly relate to the underwriting of the Company’s insurance products, the services performed for the Company’s customers or the sale of the Company’s products or services. Additionally,\nintangible asset amortization expense typically fluctuates based on the size and timing of the Company’s acquisition activity. Accordingly, the Company believes excluding the amortization of\nintangible assets enhances the Company’s and investors’ ability to compare the Company’s past financial performance with its current performance and to analyze underlying business\nperformance and trends.

Intangible asset amortization is excluded from the\nrelated non-GAAP financial measure because the amortization, unlike the related revenue, is not affected by operations of any particular period unless an intangible asset becomes impaired or\nthe estimated useful life of an intangible asset is revised.\n(2)\nIn 2022, the office real estate optimization charges primarily relate to the abandonment of leased real estate and the related right-of-use assets and property and equipment in connection with the\nplanned reduction of corporate office real estate space in response to the Company’s new flexible work arrangement.

The increase was primarily due to incremental costs associated with\nincreased volume, increased investments in the segment’s operations and capabilities, as well as decreased gains from legal settlements in 2022 compared\nto 2021.

The decrease in adjusted operating income was primarily driven\nby decreased COVID-19 vaccinations and diagnostic testing, continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure, increased investments in the segment’s\noperations and capabilities and decreased gains from legal settlements in 2022 compared to 2021.

The RBC framework described above for\ninsurers has been extended by the NAIC to health organizations, including HMOs.

Estimates and judgments are based on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to\nbe important at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, the Company reviews its accounting policies and how they are\napplied and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements. While the Company believes the historical experience, current trends and other factors\nconsidered by management support the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, actual\nresults could differ from estimates, and such differences could be material.\nSignificant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 ‘‘Significant Accounting Policies’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K.

Revenue is recognized based on customer billings,\nwhich, in the Company’s Commercial business, reflect contracted rates per member and the number of covered members recorded in the Company’s records at\nthe time the billings are prepared.

These adjustments are known\nas retroactivity adjustments. In each period, the Company estimates the amount of future retroactivity and adjusts the recorded revenue accordingly. As\ninformation regarding actual retroactivity amounts becomes known, the Company refines its estimates and records any required adjustments to revenues in the\nperiod in which they arise. A significant difference in the actual level of retroactivity compared to estimated levels would have a significant effect on the\nCompany’s operating results.\nPremium Revenue\nPremiums are recognized as revenue in the month in which the enrollee is entitled to receive health care services. Premiums are reported net of an allowance\nfor estimated terminations and uncollectible amounts. Additionally, premium revenue subject to the MLR rebate requirements of the ACA is recorded net of the\nestimated minimum MLR rebates for the current calendar year. Premiums related to unexpired contractual coverage periods (unearned premiums) are reported\nas other insurance liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized as revenue when earned.\nSome of the Company’s contracts allow for premiums to be adjusted to reflect actual experience or the relative health status of Insured members. Such\nadjustments are reasonably estimable at the outset of the contract, and adjustments to those estimates are made based on actual experience of the customer\nemerging under the contract and the terms of the underlying contract.\nServices Revenue\nServices revenue relates to contracts that can include various combinations of services or series of services which generally are capable of being distinct and\naccounted for as separate performance obligations. The Health Care Benefits segment’s services revenue primarily consists of ASC fees received in exchange\nfor performing certain claim processing and member services for ASC members. ASC fee revenue is recognized over the period the service is provided. Some\nof the Company’s administrative services contracts include guarantees with respect to certain functions, such as customer service response time, claim\nprocessing accuracy and claim processing turnaround time, as well as certain guarantees that a plan sponsor’s benefit claim experience will fall within a certain\nrange. With any of these guarantees, the Company is financially at risk if the conditions of the arrangements are not met, although the maximum amount at risk\ntypically is limited to a percentage of the fees otherwise payable to the Company by the customer involved.

The insurance premiums include a beneficiary premium, which is the responsibility of the PDP member, and can be subsidized by\nCMS in the case of low-income members, and a direct premium paid by CMS. Premiums collected in advance are initially recorded within other insurance\nliabilities and are then recognized ratably as revenue over the period in which members are entitled to receive benefits.\nRevenues also include a risk-sharing feature of the Medicare Part D program design referred to as the risk corridor. The Company estimates variable\nconsideration in the form of amounts payable to, or receivable from, CMS under the risk corridor, and adjusts revenue based on calculations of additional\nsubsidies to be received from or owed to CMS at the end of the reporting year.\nIn addition to Medicare Part D premiums, the Company receives additional payments each month from CMS related to catastrophic reinsurance, low-income\ncost-sharing subsidies and coverage gap benefits. If the subsidies received differ from the amounts earned from actual prescriptions transferred, the difference\nis recorded in either accounts receivable, net or accrued expenses.\nPharmacy Services Segment\nThe Pharmacy Services segment sells prescription drugs directly through its mail service dispensing pharmacies and indirectly through the Company’s retail\npharmacy network. The Company’s pharmacy benefit arrangements are accounted for in a manner consistent with a master supply arrangement as there are no\ncontractual minimum volumes and each prescription is considered a separate purchasing decision and distinct performance obligation transferred at a point in\ntime. PBM services performed in connection with each prescription claim are considered part of a single performance obligation which culminates in the\ndispensing of prescription drugs.\nThe Company recognizes revenue using the gross method at the contract price negotiated with its clients when the Company has concluded it controls the\nprescription drug before it is transferred to the client plan members. The Company controls prescriptions dispensed indirectly through its retail pharmacy\nnetwork because it has separate contractual arrangements with those pharmacies, has discretion in setting the price for the transaction and assumes primary\nresponsibility for fulfilling the promise to provide prescription drugs to its client plan members while also performing the related PBM services.\nRevenues include (i) the portion of the price the client pays directly to the Company, net of any discounts earned on brand name drugs or other discounts and\nrefunds paid back to the client (see “Drug Discounts” and “Guarantees” below), (ii) the price paid to the Company by client plan members for mail order\nprescriptions and the price paid to retail network pharmacies by client plan members for retail prescriptions (“retail co-payments”), and (i",

The Company has established the following revenue recognition policies for the\nPharmacy Services segment:\n•\nRevenues generated from prescription drugs sold by mail service dispensing pharmacies are recognized when the prescription drug is delivered to the\nclient plan member. At the time of delivery, the Company has performed substantially all of its performance obligations under its client contracts and does\nnot experience a significant level of returns or reshipments.\n•\nRevenues generated from prescription drugs sold by third party pharmacies in the Company’s retail pharmacy network and associated administrative fees\nare recognized at the Company’s point-of-sale, which is when the claim is adjudicated by the Company’s online claims processing system and the\nCompany has transferred control of the prescription drug and completed all of its performance obligations.\nFor contracts under which the Company acts as an agent or does not control the prescription drugs prior to transfer to the client plan member, revenue is\nrecognized using the net method.\nDrug Discounts\nThe Company records revenue net of manufacturers’ rebates earned by its clients based on their plan members’ utilization of brand-name formulary drugs. The\nCompany estimates these rebates at period-end based on actual and estimated claims data and its estimates of the manufacturers’ rebates earned by its clients.\nThe estimates are based on the best available data at period-end and recent history for the various factors that can affect the amount of rebates due to the client.\nThe Company adjusts its rebates\n94\n\n\npayable to clients to the actual amounts paid when these rebates are paid or as significant events occur. Any cumulative effect of these adjustments is recorded\nagainst revenues at the time it is identified. Adjustments generally result from contract changes with clients or manufacturers that have retroactive rebate\nadjustments, differences between the estimated and actual product mix subject to rebates, or whether the brand name drug was included in the applicable\nformulary. The effect of adjustments between estimated and actual manufacturers’ rebate amounts has not been material to the Company’s operating results or\nfinancial condition.\nGuarantees\nThe Company also adjusts revenues for refunds owed to clients resulting from pricing guarantees and performance against defined service and performance\nmetrics.

Sales taxes are not included in revenues.\nLoyalty and Other Programs\nThe Company’s customer loyalty program, ExtraCare , consists of two components, ExtraSavings\n and ExtraBucks  Rewards. ExtraSavings are coupons that\nare recorded as a reduction of revenue when redeemed as the Company concluded that they do not represent a promise to the customer to deliver additional\ngoods or services at the time of issuance because they are not tied to a specific transaction or spending level.\nExtraBucks Rewards are accumulated by customers based on their historical spending levels. Thus, the Company has determined that there is an additional\nperformance obligation to those customers at the time of the initial transaction. The Company allocates the transaction price to the initial transaction and the\nExtraBucks Rewards transaction based upon the relative standalone selling price, which considers historical redemption patterns for the rewards. Revenue\nallocated to ExtraBucks Rewards is recognized as those rewards are redeemed. At the end of each period, unredeemed ExtraBucks Rewards are reflected as a\ncontract liability.\nThe Company also offers a subscription-based membership program, CarePass , under which members are entitled to a suite of benefits delivered over the\ncourse of the subscription period, as well as a promotional reward that can be redeemed for future goods and services.

The Company monitors its\nrevenues and receivables from these reimbursement sources, as well as long-term care facilities and other third party insurance payors, and reduces revenue at\nthe revenue recognition date to properly account for the variable consideration due to anticipated differences between billed and reimbursed amounts.\nAccordingly, the total revenues and receivables reported in the Company’s consolidated financial statements are recorded at the amount expected to be\nultimately received from these payors.\n®\nTM\n®\n®\n95\n\n\nPatient co-payments associated with Medicare Part D, certain state Medicaid programs, Medicare Part B and certain third party payors typically are not\ncollected at the time products are delivered or services are rendered, but are billed to the individuals as part of normal billing procedures and subject to normal\naccounts receivable collections procedures.\nWalk-In Medical Clinics\nFor services provided by the Company’s walk-in medical clinics, revenue recognition occurs for completed services provided to patients, with adjustments\ntaken for third party payor contractual obligations and patient direct bill historical collection rates.\nImpairments of Debt Securities\nThe Company regularly reviews its debt securities to determine whether a decline in fair value below the cost basis or carrying value has occurred. If a debt\nsecurity is in an unrealized loss position and the Company has the intent to sell the security, or it is more likely than not that the Company will have to sell the\nsecurity before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the amortized cost basis of the security is written down to its fair value and the difference is recognized in\nnet income. If a debt security is in an unrealized loss position and the Company does not have the intent to sell and it is more likely than not that the Company\nwill not have to sell such security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the Company bifurcates the impairment into credit-related and non-credit related\n(yield-related) components. The amount of the credit-related component is recorded as an allowance for credit losses and recognized in net income, and the\namount of the non-credit related component is included in other comprehensive income (loss). The Company analyzes all facts and circumstances believed to\nbe relevant for each investment when performing this analysis, in accordance with applicable accounting guidance.\nIn evaluating whether a credit related loss exists, the Company considers a vari",

For unrealized losses determined to be\nthe result of market conditions (for example, increasing interest rates and volatility due to conditions in the overall market) or industry-related events, the\nCompany determines whether it intends to sell the debt security or if it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the debt security prior\nto the anticipated recovery of the debt security’s amortized cost basis. If either case is true, the Company recognizes a non-credit related impairment, and the\ncost basis or carrying amount of the debt security is written down to fair value.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded yield-related impairment losses on debt securities of $143 million, $42\nmillion and $49 million, respectively.

Unexpected changes to market factors and circumstances that\nwere not present in past reporting periods are among the factors that may result in a current period decision to sell debt securities that were not impaired in\nprior reporting periods.\nVendor Allowances and Purchase Discounts\nVendor and manufacturer receivables were $12.4 billion and $10.6 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, the majority of which relate to\npurchase discounts and vendor allowances as described below.\nPharmacy Services Segment\nThe Pharmacy Services segment receives purchase discounts on products purchased.

The Pharmacy Services segment also receives additional discounts under its wholesaler contracts if it exceeds\ncontractually defined purchase volumes. In addition, the Pharmacy Services segment receives fees from pharmaceutical manufacturers for administrative\nservices. Purchase discounts and administrative service fees are recorded as a reduction of cost of products sold.\nRetail/LTC Segment\nVendor allowances received by the Retail/LTC segment reduce the carrying cost of inventory and are recognized in cost of products sold when the related\ninventory is sold, unless they are specifically identified as a reimbursement of incremental costs for promotional programs and/or other services provided.\nAmounts that are directly linked to advertising commitments are recognized as a reduction of advertising expense (included in operating expenses) when the\nrelated advertising commitment is satisfied.

For real estate leases, the\noptions to extend are not considered reasonably certain at lease commencement because the Company reevaluates each lease on a regular basis to consider the\neconomic and strategic incentives of exercising the renewal options and regularly opens or closes stores to align with its operating strategy. Generally, the\nrenewal option periods are not included within the lease term and the associated payments are not included in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and\nlease liability. Similarly, renewal options are not included in the lease term for non-real estate leases because they are not considered reasonably certain of\nbeing exercised at lease commencement. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheets, and lease expense is\nrecognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the short-term lease.\nFor real estate leases, the Company accounts for lease components and nonlease components as a single lease component. Certain real estate leases require\nadditional payments based on sales volume, as well as reimbursement for real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance, which are expensed as\nincurred as variable lease costs. Other real estate leases contain one fixed lease payment that includes real estate taxes, common area maintenance and\ninsurance.

The fair value of the reporting units is estimated using a combination of a discounted cash flow method and a market multiple\nmethod. If the net book value (carrying amount) of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the reporting unit’s goodwill is considered to be impaired, and an\nimpairment is recognized in an amount equal to the excess.\nThe determination of the fair value of the reporting units requires the Company to make significant assumptions and estimates.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nThe Company’s earnings and financial condition are exposed to interest rate risk, credit quality risk, market valuation risk, foreign currency risk, commodity\nrisk and operational risk.\nEvaluation of Interest Rate and Credit Quality Risk\nThe Company manages interest rate risk by seeking to maintain a tight match between the durations of assets and liabilities when appropriate. The Company\nmanages credit quality risk by seeking to maintain high average credit quality ratings and diversified sector exposure within its debt securities portfolio. In\nconnection with its investment and risk management objectives, the Company also uses derivative financial instruments whose market value is at least partially\ndetermined by, among other things, levels of or changes in interest rates (short-term or long-term), duration, prepayment rates, equity markets or credit\nratings/spreads. The Company’s use of these derivatives is generally limited to hedging risk and has principally consisted of using interest rate swaps, treasury\nrate locks, forward contracts, futures contracts, warrants, put options and credit default swaps. These instruments, viewed separately, subject the Company to\nvarying degrees of interest rate, equity price and credit risk. However, when used for",

See Note 2 ‘‘Acquisitions, Divestitures and Asset Sales’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\nInvestment risks associated with experience-rated products generally do not impact the Company’s operating results. The risks associated with investments\nsupporting experience-rated pension and annuity products in the large case pensions business in the Company’s Corporate/Other segment are assumed by the\ncontract holders and not by the Company (subject to, among other things, certain minimum guarantees). Assets supporting experience-rated products may be\nsubject to contract holder or participant withdrawals.\nThe debt securities in the Company’s investment portfolio had an average credit quality rating of A at both December 31, 2022 and 2021, with a fair value of\napproximately $6.0 billion and $6.7 billion rated AAA at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The fair value of debt securities that were rated below\ninvestment grade (that is, having a credit quality rating below BBB-/Baa3) was $1.9 billion and $2.3 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively (of\nwhich 1.6% and 2.0% at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, supported experience-rated products).\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company held $202 million and $305 million, respectively, of municipal debt securities that were guaranteed by third\nparties, representing 1% of total investments at both December 31, 2022 and 2021. These securities had an average credit quality rating of AA+ and AA at\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, with the guarantee. These securities had an average credit quality rating of A at both December 31, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively, without the guarantee. The Company does not have any significant concentration of investments with third party guarantors (either direct or\nindirect).\nThe Company generally classifies debt securities as available for sale, and carries them at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets. At both December 31,\n2022 and 2021, less than 1% of debt securities were valued using inputs that reflect the Company’s assumptions (categorized as Level 3 inputs in accordance\nwith accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America). See Note 4 ‘‘Fair Value’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional\ninformation on the methodologies and key assumptions used to determine the fair value of investments.

If a debt security is in an unrealized loss\nposition and the Company does not have the intent to sell and it is more likely than not that the Company will not have to sell such security before recovery of\nits amortized cost basis, the Company bifurcates the impairment into credit-related and non-credit related components. The amount of the credit-related\ncomponent is recorded as an allowance for credit losses and recognized in net income, and the amount of the non-credit related component is included in other\ncomprehensive income (loss). The impairment of debt securities is considered a critical accounting policy. See ‘‘Critical Accounting Policies - Impairments of\nDebt Securities” in the MD&A included in Item 7 of this 10-K for additional information.\nEvaluation of Market Valuation Risks\nThe Company regularly evaluates its risk from market-sensitive instruments by examining, among other things, levels of or changes in interest rates (short-term\nor long-term), duration, prepayment rates, equity markets and/or credit ratings/spreads. The Company also regularly evaluates the appropriateness of\ninvestments relative to management-approved investment guidelines (and operates within those guidelines) and the business objectives of its portfolios.\nOn a quarterly basis, the Company reviews the impact of hypothetical net losses in its investment portfolio on the Company’s consolidated near-term financial\ncondition, operating results and cash flows assuming the occurrence of certain reasonably possible changes in near-term market rates and prices. Interest rate\nchanges (whether resulting from changes in treasury yields or credit spreads or other factors) represent the most material risk exposure category for the\nCompany. The Company has estimated the impact on the fair value of market sensitive instruments based on the net present value of cash flows using a\nrepresentative set of likely future interest rate scenarios. The assumptions used were as follows: an immediate increase of 100 basis points in interest rates\n(which the Company believes represents a moderately adverse scenario) for long-term debt issued by the Company, as well as its interest rate sensitive\ninvestments and an immediate decrease of 15% in prices for publicly traded domestic equity securities in the Company’s investment portfolio.\nAssuming an immediate inc",

Changes in the fair value of\nlong-term debt do not impact the Company’s operating results or financial condition.\n•\nThe theoretical reduction in the fair value of interest rate sensitive investments partially offset by the theoretical reduction in the fair value of interest rate\nsensitive liabilities would result in a net decline in fair value of approximately $595 million ($750 million pretax) related to continuing non-experience-\nrated products. Reductions in the fair value of investment securities would be reflected as an unrealized loss in equity, as the Company classifies these debt\nsecurities as available for sale. The Company does not record liabilities at fair value.\nIf the value of the Company’s publicly traded domestic equity securities held within its investment portfolio were to decline by 15%, this would result in a net\ndecline in fair value of $20 million ($26 million pretax).\nBased on overall exposure to interest rate risk and equity price risk, the Company believes that these changes in market rates and prices would not materially\naffect consolidated near-term financial condition, operating results or cash flows as of December 31, 2022.\nEvaluation of Foreign Currency and Commodity Risk\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company did not have any material foreign currency exchange rate or commodity derivative instruments in place and\nbelieves its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk is not material.\nEvaluation of Operational Risks\nThe Company also faces certain operational risks. Those risks include risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic and risks related to information security,\nincluding cybersecurity.\nThe spread of COVID-19, or actions taken to mitigate its spread, could have material and adverse effects on our ability to operate our businesses effectively,\nincluding as a result of the complete or partial closure of facilities or labor shortages.

See Note 2 ‘‘Acquisitions, Divestitures and Asset Sales’’\nfor additional information on the Company’s sale of PayFlex.\n113\n\n\nInvestments\nDebt Securities\nDebt securities consist primarily of U.S. Treasury and agency securities, mortgage-backed securities, corporate and foreign bonds and other debt securities.\nDebt securities are classified as either current or long-term investments based on their contractual maturities unless the Company intends to sell an investment\nwithin the next twelve months, in which case it is classified as current on the consolidated balance sheets. Debt securities are classified as available for sale and\nare carried at fair value. See Note 4 ‘‘Fair Value’’ for additional information on how the Company estimates the fair value of these investments.\nIf a debt security is in an unrealized loss position and the Company has the intent to sell the security, or it is more likely than not that the Company will have to\nsell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the amortized cost basis of the security is written down to its fair value and the difference is\nrecognized in net income. If a debt security is in an unrealized loss position and the Company does not have the intent to sell and it is more likely than not that\nthe Company will not have to sell such security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the Company bifurcates the impairment into credit-related and non-\ncredit related (yield-related) components.

The amount of the credit-related component is recorded as an allowance for credit losses and recognized in net income, and the\namount of the non-credit related component is included in other comprehensive income (loss). Interest is not accrued on debt securities when management\nbelieves the collection of interest is unlikely.\nThe credit-related component is determined by comparing the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security, considering all reasonably\navailable information relevant to the collectability of the security, with the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be\ncollected is less than the amortized cost basis of the security, the Company records an allowance for credit losses, which is limited by the amount that the fair\nvalue is less than amortized cost basis.\nFor mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities, the Company recognizes income using an effective yield based on anticipated prepayments and the\nestimated economic life of the securities. When estimates of prepayments change, the effective yield is recalculated to reflect actual payments to date and\nanticipated future payments. The Company’s investment in the security is adjusted to the amount that would have existed had the new effective yield been\napplied since the acquisition of the security, with adjustments recognized in net income.\nEquity Securities\nEquity securities with readily available fair values are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income.\nMortgage Loans\nMortgage loan investments on the consolidated balance sheets are valued at the unpaid principal balance, net of an allowance for credit losses. Mortgage loans\nwith a maturity date or a committed prepayment date within twelve months are classified as current on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company assesses\nwhether its loans share similar risk characteristics and, if so, groups such loans in a risk pool when measuring expected credit losses. The Company considers\nthe following characteristics when evaluating whether its loans share similar risk characteristics: loan-to-value ratios, property type (e.g., office, retail,\napartment, industrial), geographic location, vacancy rates and property condition.\nCredit loss reserves are determined using a loss rate method that multiplies the unpaid principal balance of each loan within a risk pool group by an estimated\nloss rate percentage. The loss rate percentage considers both the expected loan loss severity and the probability of loan default.

Interest income on problem loans (i.e., more than 60 days delinquent, in bankruptcy or in\nprocess of foreclosure) is recognized on a cash basis. Cash payments on loans in the process of foreclosure are treated as a return of principal.\n114\n\n\nOther Investments\nOther investments consist primarily of the following:\n•\nPrivate equity and hedge fund limited partnerships, which are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Under this method, the carrying value\nof the investment is based on the value of the Company’s equity ownership of the underlying investment funds provided by the general partner or manager\nof the investments, the financial statements of which generally are audited. As a result of the timing of the receipt of the valuation information provided by\nthe fund managers, these investments are generally reported on up to a three month lag. The Company reviews investments for impairment at least\nquarterly and monitors their performance throughout the year through discussions with the administrators, managers and/or general partners. If the\nCompany becomes aware of an impairment of a limited partnership’s investments through its review or prior to receiving the limited partnership’s\nfinancial statements at the financial statement date, an impairment will be recognized by recording a reduction in the carrying value of the limited\npartnership with a corresponding charge to net investment income.\n•\nInvestment real estate, which is carried on the consolidated balance sheets at depreciated cost, including capital additions, net of write-downs for other-\nthan-temporary declines in fair value. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful life of each asset. If any real\nestate investment is considered held-for-sale, it is carried at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less estimated selling costs. The Company\ngenerally estimates fair value using net operating income and applying a capitalization rate in conjunction with comparable sales information. At the time\nof the sale, the difference between the sales price and the carrying value is recorded as a realized capital gain or loss.\n•\nPrivately-placed equity securities, which are carried on the consolidated balance sheets at cost less impairments, plus or minus subsequent adjustments for\nobservable price changes.

Experience-rated products are products in the large case pensions business where the contract holder,\nnot the Company, assumes investment and other risks, subject to, among other things, minimum guarantees provided by the Company. The effect of investment\nperformance on experience-rated products is allocated to contract holders’ accounts daily, based on the underlying investment experience and, therefore, does\nnot impact the Company’s net income (as long as the contract’s minimum guarantees are not triggered). Net investment income on assets supporting large case\npensions’ experience-rated products is included in net investment income in the consolidated statements of operations and is credited to contract holders’\naccounts through a charge to benefit costs. The contract holders’ accounts are reflected in policyholders’ funds on the consolidated balance sheets.\nRealized capital gains and losses on investments (other than realized capital gains and losses on investments supporting experience-rated products) are included\nas a component of net investment income in the consolidated statements of operations.

Purchases and sales of\nmortgage loans and investment real estate are reflected on the closing date.\nRealized capital gains and losses on investments supporting large case pensions’ experience-rated products are not included in realized capital gains and losses\nin the consolidated statements of operations and instead are credited directly to contract holders’ accounts.

During the interim\nperiod between physical inventory counts, the Company accrues for anticipated physical inventory losses on a location-by-location basis based on historical\nresults and current physical inventory trends.\nReinsurance Recoverables\nThe Company utilizes reinsurance agreements primarily to: (a) reduce required capital and (b) facilitate the acquisition or disposition of certain insurance\ncontracts. Ceded reinsurance agreements permit the Company to recover a portion of its losses from reinsurers, although they do not discharge the Company’s\nprimary liability as the direct insurer of the risks reinsured. Failure of reinsurers to indemnify the Company could result in losses; however, the Company does\nnot expect charges for unrecoverable reinsurance to have a material effect on its consolidated operating results or financial condition.

Acquisition costs for certain long-duration\ninsurance contracts are deferred and are recorded as other current assets or other assets on the consolidated balance sheets and are amortized over the estimated\nlife of the contracts. The amortization of deferred acquisition costs is recorded in operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.

See Note 6 ‘‘Leases’’ for additional information\nabout these impairment charges as well as the Company’s finance leases.\nRight-of-Use Assets and Lease Liabilities\nThe Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at the inception of a contract. Right-of-use assets represent the Company’s right to use an\nunderlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Right-of-use assets\nand lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date of the lease, renewal date of the lease or significant remodeling of the lease space based on the\npresent value of the remaining future minimum lease payments. As the interest rate implicit in the Company’s leases is not readily determinable, the Company\nutilizes its incremental borrowing rate, determined by class of underlying asset, to discount the lease payments. The operating lease right-of-use assets also\ninclude lease payments made before commencement and are reduced by lease incentives.\nThe Company’s real estate leases typically contain options that permit renewals for additional periods of up to five years each. For real estate leases, the\noptions to extend are not considered reasonably certain at lease commencement because the Company reevaluates each lease on a regular basis to consider the\neconomic and strategic incentives of exercising the renewal options and regularly opens or closes stores to align with its operating strategy. Generally, the\nrenewal option periods are not included within the lease term and the associated payments are not included in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and\nlease liability. Similarly, renewal options are not included in the lease term for non-real estate leases because they are not considered reasonably certain of\nbeing exercised at lease commencement. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheets, and lease expense is\nrecognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the short-term lease.\nFor real estate leases, the Company accounts for lease components and nonlease components as a single lease component. Certain real estate leases require\nadditional payments based on sales volume, as well as reimbursement for real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance, which are expensed as\nincurred as variable lease costs. Other real estate leases contain one fixed lease payment that includes real estate taxes, common area maintenance and\ninsurance. These fixed payments are considered part of the lease payment and included in the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities.\nSee",

See Note 5 ‘‘Goodwill and Other Intangibles’’ for additional information about goodwill.\nIntangible Assets\nThe Company’s identifiable intangible assets consist primarily of trademarks, trade names, customer contracts/relationships, covenants not to compete,\ntechnology, provider networks and value of business acquired (“VOBA”). These intangible assets arise primarily from the determination of their respective fair\nmarket values at the date of acquisition. Amounts assigned to identifiable intangible assets, and their related useful lives, are derived from established valuation\ntechniques and management estimates.\nThe Company’s definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives based upon the pattern of future cash flows attributable to the\nasset. Other than VOBA, definite-lived intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method. VOBA is amortized over the expected life of the acquired\ncontracts in proportion to estimated premiums. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently, if\nnecessary, as further described in “Recoverability of Long-Lived Assets” below.\nSee Note 5 ‘‘Goodwill and Other Intangibles’’ for additional information about intangible assets.\nRecoverability of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets, excluding goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are tested for impairment using\nseparate tests described below, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such asset may not be recoverable. The\nCompany groups and evaluates these long-lived assets for impairment at the lowest level at which individual cash flows can be identified. If indicators of\nimpairment are present, the Company first compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset group\n(undiscounted). If the estimated future cash flows used in this analysis are less than the carrying amount of the asset group, an impairment loss calculation is\nprepared. The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the asset group’s estimated future cash flows (discounted). If\nrequired, an impairment loss is recorded for the portion of the asset group’s carrying value that exceeds the asset group’s estimated future cash flow",

There were no material impairment charges recognized on long-lived assets during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nSee Note 6 ‘‘Leases’’ for additional information about the right-of-use asset charges.\nWhen evaluating goodwill for potential impairment, the Company compares the fair value of its reporting units to their respective carrying amounts. The\nCompany estimates the fair value of its reporting units using a combination of a discounted cash flow method and a market multiple method. If the carrying\namount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. During the third quarter of both\n2022 and 2020, the Company performed its required annual impairment tests of goodwill and concluded there were no goodwill impairments as of the testing\ndates or during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2020.

Accordingly, during the third quarter of 2021,\nthe Company recorded a $431 million goodwill impairment charge on the remaining goodwill of the LTC reporting unit. The results of the impairment tests\nindicated that there was no impairment of goodwill of the remaining reporting units as of the testing date or during the year ended December 31, 2021. See\nNote 5 ‘‘Goodwill and Other Intangibles’’ for additional information about the goodwill impairment charge recorded during the year ended December 31, 2021.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value. The Company estimates the\nfair value of its indefinite-lived trademarks using the relief from royalty method under the\n118\n\n\nincome approach. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized, and the asset is written down to its\nestimated fair value.

Unpaid health care claims include an estimate of payments the Company will make for (i) services rendered to the Company’s Insured\nmembers but not yet reported to the Company and (ii) claims which have been reported to the Company but not yet paid, each as of the financial statement date\n(collectively, “IBNR”). Health care costs payable also include an estimate of the cost of services that will continue to be rendered after the financial statement\ndate if the Company is obligated to pay for such services in accordance with contractual or regulatory requirements.

In developing its IBNR estimate, the\nCompany consistently applies these actuarial principles and assumptions each period, with consideration to the variability of related factors. There have been\nno significant changes to the methodologies or assumptions used to develop the Company’s estimate of IBNR in 2022.\nThe Company analyzes historical claim payment patterns by comparing claim incurred dates (i.e., the date services were provided) to claim payment dates to\nestimate “completion factors.” The Company uses completion factors predominantly to estimate the ultimate cost of claims incurred more than three months\nbefore the financial statement date. The Company estimates completion factors by aggregating claim data based on the month of service and month of claim\npayment and estimating the percentage of claims incurred for a given month that are complete by each month thereafter. For any given month, substantially all\nclaims are paid within six months of the date of service, but it can take up to 48 months or longer after the date of service before all of the claims are\ncompletely resolved and paid. These historically-derived completion factors are then applied to claims paid through the financial statement date to estimate the\nultimate claim cost for a given month’s incurred claim activity. The difference between the estimated ultimate claim cost and the claims paid through the\nfinancial statement date represents the Company’s estimate of claims remaining to be paid as of the financial statement date and is included in the Company’s\nhealth care costs payable. The completion factors the Company uses reflect judgments and possible adjustments based on data such as claim inventory levels,\nclaim submission and processing patterns and, to a lesser extent, other factors such as changes in health care cost trend rates, changes in Insured membership\nand changes in product mix. If claims are submitted or processed on a faster (slower) pace than prior periods, the actual claims may be more (less) complete\nthan originally estimated using the Company’s completion factors, which may result in reserves that are higher (lower) than the ultimate cost of claims.\nBecause claims incurred within three months before the financial statement date are less mature, the Company uses a combination of historically-derived\ncompletion factors and the assumed health care cost trend rate to estimate the ultimate cost\n119\n\n\nof claims incurred for these months. The Company applies its actuarial judgment and places a greater emphasis on the assumed health care cost trend rate for\nthe most recent claim incurred dates as these months may be influenced by seasonal patterns and changes in membership and product mix.\nThe Company’s health care cost trend rate is affected by changes in per member utilization of medical services as well as changes in the unit cost of such\nservices.

The health status of the Company’s Insured\nmembers, aging of the population and other demographic characteristics, advances in medical technology and other factors continue to contribute to rising per\nmember utilization and unit costs. Changes in health care practices, inflation, new technologies, increases in the cost of prescription drugs (including specialty\npharmacy drugs), direct-to-consumer marketing by pharmaceutical companies, clusters of high-cost cases, claim intensity, changes in the regulatory\nenvironment, health care provider or member fraud and numerous other factors also contribute to the cost of health care and the Company’s health care cost\ntrend rate.\nFor each reporting period, the Company uses an extensive degree of judgment in the process of estimating its health care costs payable. As a result,\nconsiderable variability and uncertainty is inherent in such estimates, particularly with respect to claims with claim incurred dates of three months or less\nbefore the financial statement date; and the adequacy of such estimates is highly sensitive to changes in assumed completion factors and the assumed health\ncare cost trend rates. For each reporting period the Company recognizes the actuarial best estimate of health care costs payable considering the potential\nvolatility in assumed completion factors and health care cost trend rates, as well as other factors. The Company believes its estimate of health care costs\npayable is reasonable and adequate to cover its obligations at December 31, 2022; however, actual claim payments may differ from the Company’s estimates. A\nworsening (or improvement) of the Company’s health care cost trend rates or changes in completion factors from those that the Company assumed in\nestimating health care costs payable at December 31, 2022 would cause these estimates to change in the near term, and such a change could be material.\nEach quarter, the Company re-examines previously established health care costs payable estimates based on actual claim payments for prior periods and other\nchanges in facts and circumstances. Given the extensive degree of judgment in this estimate, it is possible that the Company’s estimates of health care costs\npayable could develop either favorably (that is, its actual benefit costs for the period were less than estimated) or unfavorably.

          "chunk": "ealth Care Benefits Segment\nHealth Care Benefits revenue is principally derived from insurance premiums and fees billed to customers. Revenue is recognized based on customer billings,\nwhich, in the Company’s Commercial business, reflect contracted rates per member and the number of covered members recorded in the Company’s records at\nthe time the billings are prepared. Billings are generally sent monthly for coverage during the following month. Revenue related to the Company’s Government\nbusiness is collected monthly from the U.S. federal government and various government agencies based on fixed payment rates and member eligibility.\nThe Company’s billings may be subsequently adjusted to reflect enrollment changes due to member terminations or other factors. These adjustments are known\nas retroactivity adjustments. In each period, the Company estimates the amount of future retroactivity and adjusts the recorded revenue accordingly. As\ninformation regarding actual retroactivity amounts becomes known, the Company refines its estimates and records any required adjustments to revenues in the\nperiod in which they arise.\nPremium Revenue\nPremiums are recognized as revenue in the month in which the enrollee is entitled to receive health care services. Premiums are reported net of an allowance\nfor estimated terminations and uncollectible amounts. Additionally, premium revenue subject to the minimum medical loss ratio (“MLR”) rebate requirements\nof the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (as amended, collectively, the “ACA”) is\nrecorded net of the estimated minimum MLR rebates for the current calendar year. Premiums related to unexpired contractual coverage periods (unearned\npremiums) are reported as other insurance liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized as revenue when earned.\nSome of the Company’s contracts allow for premiums to be adjusted to reflect actual experience or the relative health status of Insured members. Such\nadjustments are reasonably estimable at the outset of the contract, and adjustments to those estimates are made based on actual experience of the customer\nemerging under the contract and the terms of the underlying contract.\nServices Revenue\nServices revenue relates to contracts that can include various combinations of services or series of services which generally are capable of being distinct and\naccounted for as separate performance obligations. The Health Care Benefits segment’s services revenue primarily consists of ASC fees received in exchange\nfor performing certain claim processing and member services for ASC members. ASC fee revenue is recognized over the period the service is provided. Some\nof the Company’s administrative services contracts include guarantees with respect to certain functions, such as customer service response time, claim\nprocessing accuracy and claim processing turnaround time, as well as certain guarantees that a plan ",

With any of these guarantees, the Company is financially at risk if the conditions of the arrangements are not met, although the maximum amount at risk\ntypically is limited to a percentage of the fees otherwise payable to the Company by the customer involved. Each period the Company estimates its obligations\nunder the terms of these guarantees and records its estimate as an offset to services revenues.\nAccounting for Medicare Part D\nRevenues include insurance premiums earned by the Company’s PDPs, which are determined based on the PDP’s annual bid and related contractual\narrangements with the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”). The insurance\n122\n\n\npremiums include a beneficiary premium, which is the responsibility of the PDP member, and can be subsidized by CMS in the case of low-income members,\nand a direct premium paid by CMS. Premiums collected in advance are initially recorded within other insurance liabilities and are then recognized ratably as\nrevenue over the period in which members are entitled to receive benefits.\nRevenues also include a risk-sharing feature of the Medicare Part D program design referred to as the risk corridor. The Company estimates variable\nconsideration in the form of amounts payable to, or receivable from, CMS under the risk corridor, and adjusts revenue based on calculations of additional\nsubsidies to be received from or owed to CMS at the end of the reporting year.\nIn addition to Medicare Part D premiums, the Company receives additional payments each month from CMS related to catastrophic reinsurance, low-income\ncost-sharing subsidies and coverage gap benefits. If the subsidies received differ from the amounts earned from actual prescriptions transferred, the difference\nis recorded in either accounts receivable, net or accrued expenses.\nPharmacy Services Segment\nThe Pharmacy Services segment sells prescription drugs directly through its mail service dispensing pharmacies and indirectly through the Company’s retail\npharmacy network. The Company’s pharmacy benefit arrangements are accounted for in a manner consistent with a master supply arrangement as there are no\ncontractual minimum volumes and each prescription is considered a separate purchasing decision and distinct performance obligation transferred at a point in\ntime. PBM services performed in connection with each prescription claim are considered part of a single performance obligation which culminates in the\ndispensing of prescription drugs.\nThe Company recognizes revenue using the gross method at the contract price negotiated with its clients when the Company has concluded it controls the\nprescription drug before it is transferred to the client plan members.

Thus, the Company has determined that there is an additional\nperformance obligation to those customers at the time of the initial transaction.

The Company recognizes the funded status of its pension and OPEB plans on the consolidated balance sheets based on the year-end measurements of\nplan assets and benefit obligations. When the fair value of plan assets are in excess of the plan benefit obligations, the amounts are reported in other current\nassets and other assets. When the fair value of plan benefit obligations are in excess of plan assets, the amounts are reported in accrued expenses and other\nlong-term liabilities based on the amount by which the actuarial present value of benefits payable in the next twelve months included in the benefit obligation\nexceeds the fair value of plan assets. The net periodic benefit income for the Company’s pension and OPEB plans do not contain a service cost component as\nthese plans have been frozen for an extended period of time. Non-service cost components of pension and postretirement net periodic benefit income are\nincluded in other income in the consolidated statements of operations.\nEarnings per Share\nEarnings per share is computed using the treasury stock method.

The Company does not have a future obligation to fund losses or debts on behalf of these investments; however, it may\nvoluntarily contribute funds.

(“Cardinal”) established Red Oak Sourcing, LLC (“Red Oak”), a generic pharmaceutical sourcing entity in\nwhich the Company and Cardinal each own 50%. The Red Oak arrangement had an initial term of ten years. In 2021, the Red Oak arrangement was amended\nto extend the initial term an additional five years, for a total term of 15 years. Under this arrangement, the Company and Cardinal contributed their sourcing\nand supply chain expertise to Red Oak and agreed to source and negotiate generic pharmaceutical supply contracts for both companies through Red Oak;\nhowever, Red Oak does not own or hold inventory on behalf of either company. No physical assets (e.g., property and equipment) were contributed to Red Oak\nby either company, and minimal funding was provided to capitalize Red Oak. The Company has determined that it is the primary beneficiary of this VIE\nbecause it has the ability to direct the activities of Red Oak. Consequently, the Company consolidates Red Oak in its consolidated financial statements within\nthe Retail/LTC segment.\nCardinal is required to pay the Company quarterly payments, which began in October 2014 and will extend through June 2029. As milestones are met, the\nquarterly payments increase. The Company received $183 million from Cardinal during each of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.

This standard requires the Company to review cash flow assumptions for its long-duration insurance contracts at least annually and recognize the\neffect of changes in future cash flow assumptions in net income. This standard also requires the Company to update discount rate assumptions quarterly and\nrecognize the effect of changes in these assumptions in other comprehensive income (loss). The rate used to discount the Company’s liability for future policy\nbenefits will be based on an estimate of the yield for an upper-medium grade fixed-income instrument with a duration profile matching that of the Company’s\nliabilities. In addition, this standard changes the amortization method for deferred acquisition costs and requires additional disclosures regarding the long\nduration insurance contract liabilities in the Company’s interim and annual financial statements. The standard is effective for public companies for fiscal years,\nand interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company adopted this accounting standard on January 1, 2023, using the\nmodified retrospective transition method as of the earliest period presented, January 1, 2021, also referred to as the transition date, for changes primarily related\nto the liability for future policy benefits and deferred acquisition costs. The Company is still in the process of finalizing the impact of the new standard on its\nhistorical financial statements, but expects to record an increase to its liability for future policy benefits with a corresponding change in accumulated other\ncomprehensive income on the transition date of approximately $1 billion as a result of updating the rate used to discount the liabilities to reflect the yield for an\nupper-medium grade fixed-income instrument compared to the Company’s expected investment yield under the existing guidance.\n131\n\n\n2.\nAcquisitions, Divestitures and Asset Sales\nProposed Oak Street Health Acquisition\nOn February 7, 2023, the Company entered into a definitive merger agreement to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Oak Street Health, Inc.

Accordingly, in the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded office real estate optimization charges of\n$117 million, primarily consisting of $71 million related to operating lease right-of-use assets and $44 million related to property and equipment, within the\nHealth Care Benefits, Corporate/Other and Pharmacy Services segments.\nStore Impairment Charges\nThe Company evaluates its retail store right-of-use and property and equipment assets for impairment at the retail store level, which is the lowest level at which\ncash flows can be identified. For retail stores where there is an indicator of impairment present, the Company first compares the carrying amount of the asset\ngroup to the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset group (undiscounted). If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows used in the analysis are\nless than the carrying amount of the asset group, an impairment loss calculation is prepared. The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying amount of\nthe asset group to its estimated fair value which is the greater of the asset group’s estimated future cash flows (discounted), or the consideration of what a\nmarket participant would pay to lease the assets, net of leasing costs. The Company’s estimate of fair value considers historical results, current operating trends,\nconsolidated sales, profitability and cash flow results and forecasts. For assets which the Company has determined it will be able to sublease, the estimated\nfuture cash flows include the estimated sublease income, net of estimated leasing costs.\nWhen the carrying value of an asset group exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recorded to reduce the value of the asset group to its estimated\nfair value. As the impaired assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis primarily using unobservable inputs as of the measurement date, the assets\nare classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company completed a strategic review of its retail business and announced the creation of new formats for its stores to\ncontinue to drive higher engagement with customers. As part of this review, the Company evaluated changes in population, consumer buying patterns and\nfuture health needs to ensure it has the right kinds of stores in the right locations for consumers and for the business. In connection with this initiative, on\nNovember 17, 2021, the Board of Directors of CVS Health Corporation (the “Board”) authorized the closing of approximately 900 retail stores, approximately\n300 stores each year, between 2022 and 2024. As a result, management determined that there were indicators of impairment with respect to the impacted stores’\nasset groups, including the associated operating lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment.

Projected benefit payments are\ndiscounted to the measurement date using the corresponding rate from the yield curve that is consistent with the maturity profile of the expected\nliability cash flows.\nExpected Return on Plan Assets - The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is determined by using the plan’s target allocation and return\nexpectations based on many factors including forecasted long-term capital market real returns and the inflationary outlook on a plan by plan basis.

The Company believes COVID-19’s impact on its businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial\ncondition primarily will be driven by the geographies impacted and the severity and duration of the pandemic; the pandemic’s impact on the U.S. and global\neconomies and consumer behavior and health care utilization patterns; and the timing, scope and impact of legislation as well as other federal, state and local\ngovernmental responses to the pandemic. Those primary drivers are beyond the Company’s knowledge and control. As a result, the impact COVID-19 will\nhave on the Company’s businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition is uncertain, but the impact could be adverse and material. COVID-\n19 also may result in legal and regulatory proceedings, investigations and claims against the Company.\nGuarantees\nThe Company has the following significant guarantee arrangements at December 31, 2022:\n•\nASC Claim Funding Accounts - The Company has arrangements with certain banks for the processing of claim payments for its ASC customers. The\nbanks maintain accounts to fund claims of the Company’s ASC customers. The customer is responsible for funding the amount paid by the bank each day.\nIn these arrangements, the Company guarantees that the banks will not sustain losses if the responsible ASC customer does not properly fund its account.\nThe aggregate maximum exposure under these arrangements is generally limited to $250 million. The Company can limit its exposure to these guarantees\nby suspending the payment of claims for ASC customers that have not adequately funded the amount paid by the bank.\n•\nSeparate Accounts Assets - Certain Separate Accounts assets associated with the large case pensions business in the Corporate/Other segment represent\nfunds maintained as a contractual requirement to fund specific pension annuities that the Company has guaranteed. Minimum contractual obligations\nunderlying the guaranteed benefits in these Separate Accounts were approximately $941 million and $1.3 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively. See Note 1 ‘‘Significant Accounting Policies’’ for additional information on Separate Accounts. Contract holders assume all investment and\nmortality risk and are required to maintain Separate Accounts balances at or above a specified level. The level of required funds is a function of the risk\nunderlying the Separate Account’s investment strategy.

As a result, the Company was not required to maintain any additional liability for its related guarantees at\nDecember 31, 2022.\nLease Guarantees\nBetween 1995 and 1997, the Company sold or spun off a number of subsidiaries, including Bob’s Stores and Linens ‘n Things, each of which subsequently\nfiled for bankruptcy, and Marshalls. In many cases, when a former subsidiary leased a store, the Company provided a guarantee of the former subsidiary’s lease\nobligations for the initial lease term and any extension thereof pursuant to a renewal option provided for in the lease prior to the time of the disposition. When\nthe subsidiaries were disposed of and accounted for as discontinued operations, the Company’s guarantees remained in place, although each initial purchaser\nagreed to indemnify the Company for any lease obligations the Company was required to satisfy. If any of the purchasers or any of the former subsidiaries fail\nto make the required payments under a store lease, the Company could be required to satisfy those obligations, and any significant adverse impact of COVID-\n19 on such purchasers and/or former subsidiaries increases the risk that the Company will be required to satisfy those obligations. As of December 31, 2022,\nthe Company guaranteed 67 such store leases (excluding the lease guarantees related to Linens ‘n Things, which have been recorded as a liability on the\nconsolidated balance sheets), with the maximum remaining lease term extending through 2034.\nGuaranty Fund Assessments, Market Stabilization and Other Non-Voluntary Risk Sharing Pools\nUnder guaranty fund laws existing in all states, insurers doing business in those states can be assessed (in most states up to prescribed limits) for certain\nobligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants. The life and health insurance guaranty associations in which the Company\nparticipates that operate under these laws respond to insolvencies of long-term care insurers and life insurers as well as health insurers. The Company’s\nassessments generally are based on a formula relating to the Company’s health care premiums in the state compared to the premiums of other insurers. Certain\nstates allow assessments to be recovered over time as offsets to premium taxes. Some states have similar laws relating to HMOs and/or other payors such as\nnot-for-profit consumer-governed health plans established under the ACA.\nIn 2009, the Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner placed long-term care insurer Penn Treaty Network America Insurance Company and one of its subsidiaries\n(collectively, “Penn Treaty”) in rehabilitation, an intermediate action before insolvency, and subsequently petitioned a state court to convert the rehabilitation\ninto a liquidation.

CMS uses various payment mechanisms to allocate and adjust premium payments to the Company’s and other\ncompanies’ Medicare plans by considering the applicable health status of Medicare members as supported by information prepared, maintained and provided\nby providers. The Company collects claim and encounter data from providers and generally relies on providers to appropriately code their submissions to the\nCompany and document their medical records, including the diagnosis data submitted to the Company with claims. CMS pays increased premiums to Medicare\nAdvantage plans and Medicare PDP plans for members who have certain medical conditions identified with specific diagnosis codes. Federal regulators review\nand audit the providers’ medical records to determine whether those records support the related diagnosis codes that determine the members’ health status and\nthe resulting risk-adjusted premium payments to the Company. In that regard, CMS has instituted risk adjustment data validation (“RADV”) audits of various\nMedicare Advantage plans, including certain of the Company’s plans, to validate coding practices and supporting medical record documentation maintained by\nproviders and the resulting risk-adjusted premium payments to the plans. CMS may require the Company to refund premium payments if the Company’s risk-\nadjusted premiums are not properly supported by medical record data. The Office of the Inspector General of the HHS (the “OIG”) also is auditing the\nCompany’s risk adjustment-related data and that of other companies.

Under the revised methodology, among other things, CMS announced extrapolation of the error rate identified in the audit sample along with the\napplication of a process to account for errors in the government’s traditional fee-for-service Medicare program (“FFS Adjuster”). For contract years prior to\n2011, CMS did not extrapolate sample error rates to the entire contract, nor did CMS propose to apply a FFS adjuster. By applying the FFS Adjuster, Medicare\nAdvantage organizations would have been liable for repayments only to the extent that their extrapolated payment errors exceeded the error rate in Original\nMedicare, which could have impacted the extrapolated repayments to which Medicare Advantage organizations are subject. This revised contract-level audit\nmethodology increased the Company’s exposure to premium refunds to CMS based on incomplete medical records maintained by providers. In the RADV\naudit methodology CMS used from 2011-2013, CMS selected only a few of the Company’s Medicare Advantage contracts for various contract years for\ncontract-level RADV audits. In October 2018, CMS in the proposed rule (“Proposed Rule”) announced a new methodology for RADV audits targeting certain\nhealth conditions and members with many diagnostic conditions along with extrapolation for the error rates identified without use of a FFS Adjuster.

The Company’s\nsegments maintain separate financial information, and the Company’s chief operating decision maker (the “CODM”) evaluates the segments’ operating results\non a regular basis in deciding how to allocate resources among the segments and in assessing segment performance. The CODM evaluates the performance of\nthe Company’s segments based on adjusted operating income, which is defined as operating income (GAAP measure) excluding the impact of amortization of\nintangible assets and other items, if any, that neither relate to the ordinary course of the Company’s business nor reflect the Company’s underlying business\nperformance. See the reconciliation of consolidated operating income (GAAP measure) to consolidated adjusted operating income below for further context\nregarding the items excluded from operating income in determining adjusted operating income. The Company uses adjusted operating income as its principal\nmeasure of segment performance as it enhances the Company’s ability to compare past financial performance with current performance and analyze underlying\nbusiness performance and trends. Non-GAAP financial measures the Company discloses, such as consolidated adjusted operating income, should not be\nconsidered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nIn 2022, 2021 and 2020, revenues from the federal government accounted for 18%, 17% and 16%, respectively, of the Company’s consolidated total\nrevenues, primarily related to contracts with CMS for coverage of Medicare-eligible individuals within the Health Care Benefits segment.\n176\n\n\nThe following is a reconciliation of financial measures of the Company’s segments to the consolidated totals:\nIn millions\nHealth Care\nBenefits\nPharmacy \nServices \nRetail/\nLTC\nCorporate/\nOther\nIntersegment\nEliminations \nConsolidated\nTotals\n2022:\nRevenues from external customers\n$\n90,844  $\n157,787  $\n72,874  $\n124 \n$\n— \n$\n321,629 \nIntersegment revenues\n89 \n11,449 \n33,764 \n— \n(45,302)\n— \nNet investment income (loss)\n476 \n— \n(44)\n406 \n— \n838 \nTotal revenues\n91,409 \n169,236 \n106,594 \n530 \n(45,302)\n322,467 \n  Adjusted operating income (loss)\n5,984 \n7,356 \n6,705 \n(1,785)\n(728)\n17,532 \nDepreciation and amortization\n1,629 \n567 \n1,813 \n238 \n— \n4,247 \n2021:\nRevenues from external customers\n81,515 \n143,194 \n66,078 \n125 \n— \n290,912 \nIntersegment revenues",

Although intangible assets contribute to the Company’s revenue generation, the amortization of intangible assets does not\ndirectly relate to the underwriting of the Company’s insurance products, the services performed for the Company’s customers or the sale of the Company’s products or services. Additionally,\nintangible asset amortization expense typically fluctuates based on the size and timing of the Company’s acquisition activity. Accordingly, the Company believes excluding the amortization of\nintangible assets enhances the Company’s and investors’ ability to compare the Company’s past financial performance with its current performance and to analyze underlying business\nperformance and trends. Intangible asset amortization excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure represents the entire amount recorded within the Company’s GAAP financial\nstatements, and the revenue generated by the associated intangible assets has not been excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure. Intangible asset amortization is excluded from the\nrelated non-GAAP financial measure because the amortization, unlike the related revenue, is not affected by operations of any particular period unless an intangible asset becomes impaired or\nthe estimated useful life of an intangible asset is revised.\n(2)\nIn 2022, the office real estate optimization charges primarily relate to the abandonment of leased real estate and the related right-of-use assets and property and equipment in connection with the\nplanned reduction of corporate office real estate space in response to the Company’s new flexible work arrangement. The office real estate optimization charges are reflected in the Company’s\nGAAP consolidated statement of operations in operating expenses within the Health Care Benefits, Corporate/Other and Pharmacy Services segments.\n(3)\nIn 2022, the gain on divestiture of subsidiaries represents the pre-tax gain on the sale of bswift, which the Company sold in November 2022, and the pre-tax gain on the sale of PayFlex, which\nthe Company sold in June 2022. In 2020, the gain on divestiture of subsidiary represents the pre-tax gain on the sale of the Workers’ Compensation business, which the Company sold in July\n2020. The gains on divestitures are reflected as a reduction of operating expenses in the Company’s GAAP consolidated statements of operations within the Health Care Benefits segment.\n(4)\nIn 2022, the opioid litigation charges relate to agreements to resolve substantially all opioid claims against the Company by certain states and governmental entities.

The carrying value of the LTC business was determined to be greater than its estimated\nfair value less costs to sell and a loss on assets held for sale was recorded during the third quarter of 2022. As of December 31, 2022, the net assets of the LTC business continued to meet the\ncriteria for held-for-sale accounting and during the fourth quarter of 2022, an incremental loss on assets held for sale was recorded to write down the carrying value of the LTC business to its\nestimated fair value less costs to sell. During 2022, the loss on assets held for sale also relates to the Commercial Business reporting unit within the Health Care Benefits segment. In March\n2022, the Company reached an agreement to sell its Thailand business, which was included in the Commercial Business reporting unit. At that time, a portion of the Commercial Business\ngoodwill was specifically allocated to the Thailand business. The net assets of the Thailand business were accounted for as assets held for sale at March 31, 2022. The carrying value of the\nThailand business was determined to be greater than its estimated fair value less costs to sell and a loss on assets held for sale was recorded during the first quarter of 2022.

Except as otherwise required by law, or by the provisions of the preferred stock or the preference stock, or provided in any resolution adopted by the\nCVS Health board of directors (the “board”) with respect to any subsequently created class or series of shares of CVS Health, the holders of the shares of\ncommon stock exclusively possess all voting power. The Charter precludes cumulative voting in the election of directors. The Charter provides for a majority\nvote standard for uncontested elections of directors, and a plurality of votes standard for contested elections of directors. Subject to any rights of any\noutstanding series of preferred stock or preference stock, (i) the holders of shares of common stock are entitled to such dividends as may be declared from time\nto time by the board from funds available therefor, (ii) no dividends may be declared, paid, or set aside for payment on shares of common stock unless full\ncumulative dividends are paid on any outstanding preference stock and any other preferred stock issued and outstanding at such time that is designated to have\nsuch dividend preference and (iii) upon dissolution the holders of shares of common stock are entitled to receive pro rata all assets of CVS Health available for\ndistribution to such holders, subject to any liquidation preferences designated to any preferred stock or preference stock that may be issued and outstanding at\nsuch time of liquidation.\nNo Preemptive Rights\nThe Charter provides that no holder of any shares of CVS Health of any class or series may have any preemptive right to purchase or subscribe to any\nshares of CVS Health or any security convertible into shares of CVS Health of any class or series.\nProvisions Relating to Amendments to CVS Health’s Charter and By-Laws\nUnder Delaware law, stockholders have the right to adopt, amend or repeal the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of a corporation. However,\nDelaware law requires that any amendment to the Charter also be approved by the board. Under Delaware law, unless a higher vote is required in a\ncorporation’s certificate of incorporation, amendments to the corporation’s certificate of incorporation will be adopted upon receiving at a properly convened\nmeeting the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by all stockholders entitled to vote thereon, and if any class or series is entitled to vote thereon as a\nclass, the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast in each class vote.\nIn addition, the By-Laws may be amended by the board with respect to all matters not exclusively",

The Charter also authorizes the board to issue shares of preferred stock or preference stock, from time to time, in such class or\nclasses, and such series within any class, and with such designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights, and qualifications,\nlimitations or restrictions thereof as the board may determine, including, for example, (i) the designation of the class or series; (ii) the number of shares of the\nclass or series, which number the board may thereafter (except where otherwise provided in the designation of any subsequently authorized class or series)\nincrease or decrease (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding); (iii) whether dividends, if any, will be cumulative or noncumulative and the\ndividend rate of the class or series; (iv) the dates on which dividends, if any, will be payable; (v) the redemption rights and price or prices, if any, for shares of\nthe class or series; (vi) the terms and amounts of any sinking fund provided for the purchase or redemption of shares of the class or series; (vii) the amounts\npayable on shares of the class or series in the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of CVS Health;\n(viii) whether the shares of the class or series will be convertible into shares of any other class or series, or any other security, of CVS Health or any other\ncorporation, and, if so, the specification of such other class or series or such other security, the conversion price or prices or rate or rates, any adjustments\nthereof, the date or dates as of which such shares will be convertible and all other terms and conditions upon which such conversion may be made;\n(ix) restrictions on the issuance of shares of the same class or series or of any other class or series; and (x) the voting rights, if any, of the holders of such class\nor series.

New entrants into the\nmarketplace, as well as consolidation within the industry, have contributed to and are expected to intensify the competitive environment. In addition, the rapid\npace of change as the industry evolves towards a consumer-focused retail marketplace, including Insurance Exchanges, and the increased use of technology to\ninteract with members, providers and customers, increase the risks the Company faces from new entrants and disruptive actions by existing competitors\ncompared to prior periods.\nThe Company believes that the significant factors that distinguish competing health plans include the perceived overall quality (including accreditation\nstatus), quality of service, comprehensiveness of coverage, cost (including premium rates, provider discounts and member out-of-pocket costs), product\ndesign, financial stability and ratings, breadth and quality of provider networks, ability to offer different provider network options, providers available in such\nnetworks, and quality of member support and care management programs. The Company believes that it is competitive on each of these factors. The\nCompany’s ability to increase the number of persons covered by its health plans or to increase Health Care Benefits segment revenues is affected by its ability\nto differentiate itself from its competitors on these factors.

The Biden administration most recently renewed\nthe PHE on January 11, 2023 and has indicated that they intend for the PHE to expire on May 11, 2023. The Families First Coronavirus Response Act (the\n“Families First Act”) and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) were enacted in March 2020. Each of the Families First\nAct and the CARES Act requires the Company to provide coverage for COVID-19 related medical services, in many cases without member cost-sharing, in its\nInsured Health Care Benefits products.\nThe CARES Act also provides relief funding to providers to reimburse them for health care related expenses incurred in preventing, preparing for and/or\nresponding to COVID-19 (provided no other source is obligated to reimburse those expenses) or lost health care related revenues that are attributable to\nCOVID-19. Under the CARES Act, the Company receives reimbursement for uninsured patients in connection with COVID-19 testing and vaccination as well\nas monoclonal antibody treatment. Aside from such reimbursement, the Company has not requested any funding under the CARES Act. However, in the\nsecond quarter of 2020, the Company received $43 million from the CARES Act provider relief fund, all of which was returned to the HHS during the second\nquarter of 2020.\nThe CARES Act also allows for the deferral of the payment of the employer share of Social Security taxes effective March 27, 2020 by permitting them to\nremit the associated payments in two equal installments on or about December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2022.

Several of these are subject to judicial challenges. We are continuing to closely monitor and update\nour practices in response to developments or changes in the COVID-19 vaccination policies established by various federal agencies as well as the several state-\nand municipal-specific COVID-19 vaccine mandates that provide expanded exemptions, modifications, requirements or restrictions regarding employee\nvaccinations.

Employees must apply and be approved for a reasonable accommodation in order to\nbe exempt from the vaccination requirement.\nAdditionally, in January 2022, the HHS announced that commercial health insurers must cover the costs of up to eight rapid COVID-19 OTC test kits per\nindividual per 30-day period. Coverage for COVID-19 OTC test kits has subsequently been required by Medicare and, in many states, Medicaid. These\nrequirements may increase benefit costs in those businesses and jurisdictions, and may increase revenues in our retail business.

Potential sanctions for violating these\nlaws include recoupment or reduction of government reimbursement amounts, civil penalties, treble damages, and exclusion from participation in government\nhealth care programs. Such laws include the federal False Claims Act (the “False Claims Act”), the federal anti-kickback statute (the “AKS”), state false claims\nacts and anti-kickback statutes in most states, the federal “Stark Law” and related state laws. In particular, the False Claims Act prohibits intentionally\nsubmitting, conspiring to submit, or causing to be submitted, false claims, records, or statements to the federal government, or intentionally failing to return\noverpayments, in connection with reimbursement by federal government programs. In addition, any claim for government reimbursement also violates the\nFalse Claims Act where it results from a violation of the AKS.\nBoth federal and state false claims laws permit private individuals to file qui tam or “whistleblower” lawsuits on behalf of the federal or state government.\nParticipants in the health and related benefits industry, including the Company, frequently are subject to actions under the False Claims Act or similar state\nlaws. The federal Stark Law generally prohibits physicians from referring Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries for certain services, including outpatient\nprescription drugs, to any entity with which the physician, or an immediate family member of the physician, has a financial relationship. The Stark Law further\nprohibits the entity receiving a prohibited referral from presenting a claim for reimbursement by Medicare or Medicaid for services furnished pursuant to the\nprohibited referral.

Even though the ACA was deemed constitutional, there may nevertheless be\ncontinued efforts to invalidate, modify, repeal or replace portions of it.

For example, the ACA requires minimum MLRs for Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part\nD plans of 85%. If a Medicare Advantage or Medicare Part D contract pays minimum MLR rebates for three consecutive years, it will become ineligible to\nenroll new members. If a Medicare Advantage or Medicare Part D contract pays such rebates for five consecutive years, it will be terminated by CMS. Due to\npotential lower utilization of medical services by Medicare beneficiaries during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is possible certain Medicare Advantage contracts\nmay not meet the 85% MLR for consecutive years.\nThe Company’s Medicare Advantage and PDP products are heavily regulated by CMS. The regulations and contractual requirements applicable to the\nCompany and other private participants in Medicare programs are complex, expensive to comply with and subject to change. For example, the Medicare\nAdvantage Overpayment Rule, issued in 2014, implemented the ACA requirements that Medicare Advantage and PDP plans report and refund to CMS\noverpayments that those plans receive from CMS. Failure to notify overpayments to CMS could result in liability under the False Claims Act. The precise\ninterpretation, impact and legality of this rule are subject to pending litigation. Payments the Company receives from CMS for its Medicare Advantage and Part\nD businesses also are subject to risk adjustment based on the health status of the individuals enrolled. Elements of that risk adjustment mechanism continue to\nbe challenged by the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”), the Office of the Inspector General of the HHS (the “OIG”) and CMS itself.

The new safe harbors are (i) for rebates which are passed on to\nthe patient at the point of sale and (ii) for flat service fee payments made to PBMs which cannot be tied to the list prices of drugs. It is unclear whether the\nRebate Rule will be enforceable, whether pharmaceutical companies will respond by reducing list prices, whether list prices in the private market may also be\nreduced, and what the resulting impact will be to PBMs or the Company. The Pharmaceutical Care Management Association (the “PCMA”), which represents\nPBMs, has filed a suit in an effort to block the Rebate Rule, claiming that the Rebate Rule would lead to higher premiums in Medicare Part D and was adopted\nin an unlawful manner. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Act of 2021 delays the effective date of the rebate rule to January 2026, and the Inflation Reduction Act,\nenacted in August 2022, further delays the Rebate Rule through 2032.\nIn July 2022, the 2% Medicare sequester required by the Budget Control Act of 2011 resumed, meaning that Medicare claims incur a 2% reduction in Medicare\npayment. The sequester had been suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nGoing forward, the Company expects CMS, the OIG, the DOJ, other federal agencies and the U.S. Congress to continue to scrutinize closely each component\nof the Medicare program (including Medicare Advantage, PDPs, demonstration projects such as Medicare-Medicaid plans and provider network access and\nadequacy), modify the terms and requirements of the program and possibly seek to recast or limit private insurers’ roles. It is also possible that Congress may\nconsider changes to Medicare Advantage payment policies due to recent recommendations by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission and to reduce the\npotential added cost burden of costly new benefits, or policies that impact drug pricing such as price controls and inflationary rebates applied to pharmaceutical\nmanufacturers.\nIt is not possible to predict the outcome of such regulatory or Congressional activity, any of which could materially and adversely affect the Company.\nMedicare Audits - CMS regularly audits the Company’s performance to determine its compliance with CMS’s regulations and its contracts with CMS and to\nassess the quality of services it provides to Medicare Advantage and PDP beneficiaries. For example, CMS conducts risk adjustment data validation (“RADV”)\naudits of a subset of Medicare Advantage contracts for each contract year. Since 2011, C",

The OIG also is auditing the Company’s risk adjustment\ndata and that of other companies, and the Company expects CMS and the OIG to continue auditing risk adjustment data. The Company also has received Civil\nInvestigative Demands (“CIDs”) from, and provided documents and information to, the Civil Division of the DOJ in connection with a current investigation of\nits patient chart review processes in connection with risk adjustment data submissions under Parts C and D of the Medicare program.\nOn January 30, 2023, CMS released the final rule concerning Part C contract-level Risk Adjustment Data Validation Audits (the “RADV Audit Rule”). The\nRADV Audit Rule eliminated the application of a fee-for-service adjuster (“FFS Adjuster”) in contract-level RADV audits but continued the use of\nextrapolation in such audits of Medicare Advantage organizations. The FFS Adjuster that was announced in 2012 was to be used by CMS to determine a\npermissible level of payment error. By applying the FFS Adjuster, Medicare Advantage organizations would have been liable for repayments only to the extent\nthat their extrapolated payment errors exceeded the error rate in Original Medicare, which could have impacted the extrapolated repayments to which Medicare\nAdvantage organizations are subject. Under the RADV Audit Rule, CMS, in most cases, will conduct RADV audits for payment year 2018 and subsequent\npayment years using extrapolation without the application of a FFS Adjuster. The RADV Audit Rule may have potential adverse effects, which could be\nmaterial, on the Company’s operating results, financial condition, and cash flows. CMS also has announced that it will not conduct RADV audits on all\ncontracts; instead, it will only audit contracts it believes are at the highest risk for overpayments based on its statistical modeling.\nMedicare Star Ratings - A portion of each Medicare Advantage plan’s reimbursement is tied to the plan’s “star ratings.” The star rating system considers a\nvariety of measures adopted by CMS, including quality of preventative services, chronic illness management, compliance and overall customer satisfaction.\nOnly Medicare Advantage plans with an overall star rating of 4 or more stars (out of 5 stars) are eligible for a quality bonus in their basic premium rates. As a\nresult, the Company’s Medicare Advantage plans’ operating results in 2023 and going forward will be significantly affected by their star ratings. The\nCompany’s star ratings and past performance scores are adversely affected by any compliance issues that may have arisen each year in its Medicare operations.\nCMS released the Company’s 2023 star ratings in October 2022. The Company’s 2023 star ratings will be used to determine which of its Medicare Advantage\nplans have ratings of 4 stars or higher and qualify for bonu",

Based on the 2023 star ratings, the percentage of the Company’s Medicare\nAdvantage members in 4 or more stars plans is expected to drop to 21% (based on enrollment and contract affiliation at December 31, 2022), as compared to\n87%\n21\n\n\nbased on the 2022 star ratings. The main driver of this decrease was a 1 star decrease in the Company’s Aetna National PPO, which dropped from 4.5 to 3.5\nstars, while many of the Company’s other plans remain rated at 4 or more stars. The decrease in the star rating for the Aetna National PPO will mean that it will\nno longer be eligible for CMS’ quality bonus payments related to 2024, though the Company’s contract diversification efforts, which will partially mitigate\ncertain adverse impacts associated with the decrease in the star rating for the Aetna National PPO, have received regulatory approval. CMS also gives PDPs\nstar ratings that affect each PDP’s enrollment. Medicare Advantage and PDP plans that are rated less than 3 stars for three consecutive years are subject to\ncontract termination by CMS. CMS continues to revise its star ratings system to make it harder to achieve 4 or more stars. There can be no assurances that the\nCompany will be successful in maintaining or improving its star ratings in future years. Accordingly, the Company’s Medicare Advantage plans may not\ncontinue to be or become eligible for full level quality bonuses, which could adversely affect the benefits such plans can offer, reduce membership and/or\nreduce profit margins.\nMedicare Payment Rates - In April 2022, CMS issued its final notice detailing final 2023 Medicare Advantage payment rates. Final 2023 Medicare\nAdvantage rates resulted in an expected average increase in revenue for the Medicare Advantage industry of 5.00%, excluding the CMS estimate of Medicare\nAdvantage risk score trend. On February 1, 2023, CMS issued an advance notice detailing proposed 2024 Medicare Advantage payment rates. The 2024\nMedicare Advantage rates, if finalized as proposed, will result in an expected average decrease in revenue for the Medicare Advantage industry of 2.27%,\nexcluding the CMS estimate of Medicare Advantage risk score trend. CMS intends to publish the final 2024 rate announcement no later than April 3, 2023. The\nfederal government may seek to impose restrictions on the configuration of pharmacy or other provider networks for Medicare Advantage and/or PDP plans, or\notherwise restrict the ability of these plans to alter benefits, negotiate prices or establish other terms to improve affordability or maintain viability of products.\nThe Company currently believes that the payments it has received and will receive in the near term are adequate to justify the Company’s continued\nparticipation in the Medicare Advantage and PDP programs, although there are economic and political pressures to continue to reduce spending on the\nprogram, and this outlook could change.\n340B Drug Pricing Program – The 340B Drug Prici",

In 2020, a number of pharmaceutical manufacturers\nbegan programs that limited Covered Entities’ participation in the program through contract pharmacies arrangements. In May 2021, HRSA sent enforcement\nletters to multiple manufacturers to curb these practices. In September 2021, HRSA forwarded the enforcement actions to the OIG for potential imposition of\ncivil monetary penalties. Those enforcement actions are currently subject to ongoing litigation. In November 2022, HRSA issued proposed rules that would\noverhaul the 340B Drug Pricing Programs Administrative Dispute Resolution process. The revisions are designed to make the process more accessible by\nmaking it more expeditious and less formal, as well as more equitable by requiring fewer resources to participate. A reduction in Covered Entities’ participation\nin contract pharmacy arrangements, as a result of the pending enforcement actions or otherwise, a reduction in the use of the Company’s administrative\nservices by Covered Entities, or a reduction in drug manufacturers’ participation in the program could materially and adversely affect the Company.\nAnti-Remuneration Laws - Federal law prohibits, among other things, an entity from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving, subject\nto certain exceptions and “safe harbors,” any remuneration to induce the referral of individuals or the purchase, lease or order of items or services for which\npayment may be made under Medicare, Medicaid or certain other federal and state health care programs. A number of states have similar laws, some of which\nare not limited to services paid for with government funds. Sanctions for violating these federal and state anti-remuneration laws may include imprisonment,\ncriminal and civil fines, and exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state government-sponsored health care programs.\nCompanies involved in public health care programs such as Medicare and/or Medicaid are required to maintain compliance programs to detect and deter fraud,\nwaste and abuse, and are often the subject of fraud, waste and abuse investigations and audits. The Company has invested significant resources to comply with\nMedicare and Medicaid program standards. Ongoing vigorous law enforcement and the highly technical regulatory scheme mean that the Company’s\ncompliance efforts in this area will continue to require significant resources.\nAntitrust and Unfair Competition - The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) investigates and prosecutes practices that are “unfair trade practices” or\n“unfair methods of competition.” Numerous lawsuits have been filed throughout the United States against pharmaceutical manufacturers, retail pharmacies\nand/or PBMs under various federal a",

In addition to PII, the Company uses and discloses de-identified data for analytical\nand other purposes when permitted. Additionally, there are industry standards for handling credit card data known as the Payment Card Industry Data Security\nStandard, which are a set of requirements designed to help ensure that entities that process, store or transmit credit card information maintain a secure\nenvironment. Certain states have incorporated these requirements into state laws or enacted other requirements relating to the use and/or disclosure of PII.\nThe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and the regulations issued thereunder (collectively, “HIPAA”), as further modified by\nthe American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (“ARRA”) impose extensive requirements on the way in which health plans, providers, health care\nclearinghouses (known as “covered entities”) and their business associates use, disclose and safeguard protected health information (“PHI”). Further, ARRA\nrequires the Company and other covered entities to report any breaches of PHI to impacted individuals and to the HHS and to notify the media in any states\nwhere 500 or more people are impacted by the unauthorized release or use of or access to PHI. Criminal penalties and civil sanctions may be imposed for\nfailing to comply with HIPAA standards.

The HITECH Act also extended HIPAA privacy and security requirements and penalties directly to business associates. HHS has begun to audit health\nplans, providers and other parties to enforce HIPAA compliance, including with respect to data security.\nIn addition to HIPAA, state health privacy laws apply to the extent they are more protective of individual privacy than is HIPAA, including laws that place\nstricter controls on the release of information relating to specific diseases or conditions and requirements to notify members of unauthorized release or use of or\naccess to PHI. States also have adopted regulations to implement provisions of the Financial Modernization Act of 1999 (also known as the Gramm-Leach-\nBliley Act (“GLBA”)) which generally require insurers, including health insurers, to provide customers with notice regarding how their non-public personal\nhealth and financial information is used and the opportunity to “opt out” of certain disclosures before the insurer shares such information with a non-affiliated\nthird party. Like HIPAA, GLBA sets a “floor” standard, allowing states to adopt more stringent requirements governing privacy protection. Complying with\nadditional state requirements requires us to make additional investments beyond those the Company has made to comply with HIPAA and GLBA.\nThe Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 encourages organizations to share cyber threat indicators with the federal government and, among other\nthings, directs HHS to develop a set of voluntary cybersecurity best practices for organizations in the health care industry. In addition, states have begun to\nenact more comprehensive privacy laws and regulations addressing consumer rights to data access, deletion, protection or transparency, such as the California\nConsumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”). States also are starting to issue regulations and proposed regulations specifically related to cybersecurity, such as the\nregulations issued by the New York Department of Financial Services. Complying with conflicting cybersecurity regulations, which may differ from state to\nstate, requires significant resources. In addition, differing approaches to state privacy and/or cyber-security regulation and varying enforcement philosophies\nmay materially and adversely affect the Company’s ability to standardize its products and services across state lines. Widely-reported large scale commercial\ndata breaches in the United States and abroad increase the likelihood that additional data security legislation will be considered by additional states.

These standards may differ from, and be\nmore stringent than, HIPAA.\nConsumer Protection Laws - The federal government has many consumer protection laws, such as the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Federal Postal\nService Act and the Consumer Product Safety Act. Most states also have similar consumer protection laws and a growing number of states regulate subscription\nprograms. In addition, the federal government and most states have adopted laws and/or regulations requiring places of public accommodation, health care\nservices and other goods and\n23\n\n\nservices to be accessible to people with disabilities. These consumer protection and accessibility laws and regulations have been the basis for investigations,\nlawsuits and multistate settlements relating to, among other matters, the marketing of loyalty programs, and health care products and services, pricing accuracy,\nexpired front store products, financial incentives provided by drug manufacturers to pharmacies in connection with therapeutic interchange programs,\ndisclosures related to how personal data is used and protected and the accessibility of goods and services to people with disabilities. As a result of the\nCompany’s direct-to-consumer activities, including mobile and web-based solutions offered to members and to other consumers, the Company also is subject\nto federal and state regulations applicable to electronic communications and to other general consumer protection laws and regulations.

Since then,\nCongress has extended and modified the Medicare sequester a number of times. The CARES Act temporarily suspended the Medicare sequester and\nextended mandatory sequestration to 2030.

These contracts with the OPM and applicable government regulations establish\npremium rating arrangements for this program. In addition to other requirements, such as the Transparency in Coverage Rule note above, OPM regulations\nrequire that community-rated FEHB plans meet a FEHB program-specific minimum MLR by plan code and market. Managing to these rules is complicated by\nthe simultaneous application of the minimum MLR standards and associated premium rebate requirements of the ACA. The Company also has a contractual\narrangement with carriers for the FEHB program, such as the BlueCross BlueShield Association, to provide pharmacy services to federal employees, postal\nworkers, annuitants, and their dependents under the Government-wide Service Benefit Plan, as authorized by the FEHB Act and as part of the FEHB program.\nAdditionally, the Company manages certain FEHB plans on a “cost-plus” basis.

The Company has taken steps to be able to continue to serve customers in the European Economic Area following the\nUnited Kingdom’s exit from the EU (“Brexit”).\nThe Company’s international operations are subject to different, and sometimes more stringent, legal and regulatory requirements, which vary widely by\njurisdiction, including anti-corruption laws; economic sanctions laws; various privacy, insurance, tax, tariff and trade laws and regulations; corporate\ngovernance, privacy, data protection (including the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation which began to apply across the EU during 2018), data mining,\ndata transfer, labor and employment, intellectual property, consumer protection and investment laws and regulations; discriminatory licensing procedures;\ncompulsory cessions of reinsurance; required localization of records and funds; higher premium and income taxes; limitations on dividends and repatriation of\ncapital; and requirements for local participation in an insurer’s ownership. In addition, the presence of operations in foreign countries potentially increases the\nCompany’s exposure to the anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-money laundering provisions of U.S. law, including the FCPA, and corresponding foreign\nlaws, including the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 (the “UK Bribery Act”).\nAnti-Corruption Laws - The FCPA prohibits offering, promising or authorizing others to give anything of value to a foreign government official to obtain or\nretain business or otherwise secure a business advantage. The Company also is subject to applicable anti-corruption laws of the jurisdictions in which it\noperates. In many countries outside the United States, health care professionals are employed by the government. Therefore, the Company’s dealings with them\nare subject to regulation under the FCPA. Violations of the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions as well as\nother penalties, and there continues to be a heightened level of FCPA enforcement activity by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and\nthe DOJ. The UK Bribery Act is an anti-corruption law that is broader in scope than the FCPA and applies to all companies with a nexus to the United\nKingdom.

In general, these limitations apply to certain customer\nsegments and limit the Company’s ability to set prices for new or renewing groups, or both, based on specific characteristics of the group or the group’s prior\nclaim experience. In some states, these laws and regulations restrict the Company’s ability to price for the risk it assumes and/or reflect reasonable costs in the\nCompany’s pricing.\nThe ACA expanded the premium rate review process by, among other things, requiring the Company’s Commercial Insured rates to be reviewed for\n“reasonableness” at either the state or the federal level. HHS established a federal premium rate review process that generally applies to proposed premium rate\nincreases equal to or exceeding a federally (or lower state) specified threshold. HHS’s rate review process imposes additional public disclosure requirements as\nwell as additional review on filings requesting premium rate increases equal to or exceeding this “reasonableness” threshold. These combined state and federal\nreview requirements may prevent, further delay or otherwise affect the Company’s ability to price for the risk it assumes, which could adversely affect its\nMBRs and operating results, particularly during periods of increased utilization of medical services and/or medical cost trend or when such utilization and/or\ntrend exceeds the Company’s projections.\nThe ACA also specifies minimum MLRs of 85% for large group Commercial products and 80% for individual and small group Commercial products. Because\nthe ACA minimum MLRs are structured as “floors” for many of their requirements, states have the latitude to enact more stringent rules governing these\nrestrictions. For Commercial products, states have and may adopt higher minimum MLR requirements, use more stringent definitions of “medical loss ratio,”\nincorporate minimum MLR requirements into prospective premium rate filings, require prior approval of premium rates or impose other requirements related\nto minimum MLR. Minimum MLR requirements and similar actions further limit the level of margin the Company can earn in its Insured Commercial\nproducts while leaving the Company exposed to medical costs that are higher than those reflected in its pricing. The Company also may be subject to\nsignificant fines, penalties, premium refunds and litigation if it fails to comply with minimum MLR laws and regulations.\nIn addition, the Company requested increases in its premium rates in its Commercial Health Care Benefits business for 2023 and expects to request future\nincreases in those rates in order to adequately price for projected medical cost trends, required expansions of coverage and rating limits, and significant\nassessments, fees and taxes imposed by the federal and state governments, including as a result of the ACA.

These rate increases may be significant and thus heighten the risks of\nadverse publicity, adverse regulatory action and adverse selection and the likelihood that the Company’s requested premium rate increases will be denied,\nreduced or delayed, which could lead to operating margin compression.\nMany of the laws and regulations governing the Company’s pricing and underwriting practices also limit the differentials in premium rates insurers and other\ncarriers may charge between new and renewal business, and/or between groups based on differing characteristics. They may also require that carriers disclose\nto customers the basis on which the carrier establishes new business and renewal premium rates and limit the ability of a carrier to terminate customers’\ncoverage.\nMedicaid Regulation - The Company is seeking to substantially grow its Medicaid, dual eligible and dual eligible special needs plan businesses over the next\nseveral years. As a result, the Company also is increasing its exposure to changes in government policy with respect to and/or regulation of the various\nMedicaid, dual eligible and dual eligible special needs plan programs in which the Company participates, including changes in the amounts payable to the\nCompany under those programs.\nIn addition to a quality rating system that applies to Medicaid and Managed Medicaid plans, federal regulations give states the option to choose to establish a\nminimum MLR of at least 85% for their Managed Medicaid plans, including those offered by the Company. Regardless of whether a state establishes a\nminimum MLR, it must use plan-reported MLR data to set future\n30\n\n\npayment rates for managed care, so that its plans will “reasonably achieve” an MLR of at least 85%. For Managed Medicaid products, states may use more\nstringent definitions of “medical loss ratio”, use discretion in choosing a quantitative standard for determining provider network adequacy, or impose other\nrequirements related to minimum MLR. Minimum MLR requirements and similar actions further limit the level of margin the Company can earn in its Insured\nMedicaid products while leaving the Company exposed to medical costs that are higher than those reflected in its pricing.

While historically the Company has ultimately\nrecovered more than half of guaranty fund assessments through statutorily permitted premium tax offsets, significant increases in assessments could lead to\nlegislative and/or regulatory actions that limit future offsets.\nLaws and Regulations Related to the Pharmacy Services Segment\nIn addition to the laws and regulations discussed above that may affect multiple segments of the Company’s business, the Company is subject to federal, state\nand local statutes and regulations governing the operation of its Pharmacy Services segment specifically. Among these are the following:\nPBM Laws and Regulation - Legislation and/or regulations seeking to regulate PBM activities in a comprehensive manner have been proposed or enacted in a\nmajority of states. This legislation could adversely affect the Company’s ability to conduct business on commercially reasonable terms in states where the\nlegislation is in effect and the Company’s ability to standardize its PBM products and services across state lines. In addition, certain quasi-regulatory\norganizations, including the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy and the National Council of Insurance Legislators, have issued model regulations or\nmay propose future regulations concerning PBMs and/or PBM activities. Similarly, credentialing organizations such as URAC have established voluntary\nstandards regarding PBM, mail order pharmacy and/or specialty pharmacy activities. While the actions of these quasi-regulatory or standard-setting\norganizations do not have the force of law, they may influence states to adopt their requirements or recommendations and influence client requirements for\nPBM, mail order pharmacy and/or specialty pharmacy services. Moreover, any standards established by these organizations could also impact the Company’s\nhealth plan clients and/or the services provided to those clients and/or the Company’s health plans.\nThe Company’s PBM activities also are regulated directly and indirectly at the federal and state levels, including being subject to the False Claims Act and state\nfalse claims acts and the AKS and state anti-kickback laws. These laws and regulations govern, and proposed legislation and regulations may govern and/or\nfurther restrict, critical PBM practices, including disclosure, receipt and retention of rebates and other payments received from pharmaceutical manufacturers;\nuse of, administration of and/or changes to drug formularies, maximum allowable cost (“MAC”) list pricing, average wholesale prices (“AWP”) and/or clinical\nprograms; the offering to plan sponsors of pricing tha",

However, state departments of insurance are increasing their oversight of PBM activities due to\nlegislation passing in a number of states requiring PBMs to register or obtain a license with the department, including through market conduct examinations\nand other audits our licensed entities. In addition, rulemaking is either underway or has already taken place in a number of states with the areas of focus\nincluding licensure requirements, pharmacy reimbursement, network design, cost sharing and pharmacy audits - most of which fall under the state insurance\ncode.\n32\n\n\nPharmacy Network Access Legislation - Medicare Part D and a majority of states now have some form of legislation affecting the Company’s (and its health\nplans’ and its health plan clients’) ability to limit access to a pharmacy provider network or remove pharmacy network providers. For example, certain “any\nwilling provider” legislation may require the Company or its clients to admit a nonparticipating pharmacy if such pharmacy is willing and able to meet the\nplan’s price and other applicable terms and conditions for network participation. These laws could negatively affect the services and economic benefits\nachievable through a limited pharmacy provider network. Also, a majority of states now have some form of legislation affecting the Company’s ability (and the\nCompany’s and its client health plans’ ability) to conduct audits of network pharmacies regarding claims submitted to the Company for payment. These laws\ncould negatively affect the Company’s ability to recover overpayments of claims submitted by network pharmacies that the Company identifies through\npharmacy audits.

MAC methodology is a common cost management practice used by private and public payors (including CMS) to pay pharmacies for\ndispensing generic prescription drugs. MAC prices specify the allowable reimbursement by a PBM for a particular strength and dosage of a generic drug that is\navailable from multiple manufacturers but sold at different prices. State legislation can regulate the disclosure of MAC prices and MAC price methodologies,\nthe kinds of drugs that a PBM can pay for at a MAC price, and the rights of pharmacies to appeal a MAC price established by a PBM. These laws could\nnegatively affect the Company’s ability to establish MAC prices for generic drugs. Additionally, some states have passed legislation that would restrict certain\ntypes of retroactive reconciliation or recoupment from pharmacies in the network or create a reimbursement benchmark mandate, such as the national average\ndrug acquisition cost and/or the wholesale acquisition cost (“WAC”), plus a set dispensing fee, for pharmacies in the network.\nFormulary and Plan Design Regulation - A number of government entities regulate the administration of prescription drug benefits. HHS regulates how\nMedicare Part D formularies are developed and administered, including requiring the inclusion of all drugs in certain classes and categories, subject to limited\nexceptions. Under the ACA, CMS imposes drug coverage requirements for health plans required to cover essential health benefits, including plans offered\nthrough federal or state Public Exchanges. Additionally, the NAIC and health care accreditation agencies like NCQA and URAC have developed model acts\nand standards for formulary development that are often incorporated into government requirements. Many states regulate the scope of prescription drug\ncoverage, as well as the delivery channels to receive prescriptions, for insurers, MCOs and Medicaid managed care plans. The increasing government\nregulation of formularies could significantly affect the Company’s ability to develop and administer formularies, pharmacy networks and other plan design\nfeatures. Similarly, some states prohibit health plan sponsors from implementing certain restrictive pharmacy benefit plan design features. This regulation could\nlimit or preclude (i) limited networks, (ii) a requirement to use particular providers, (iii) copayment differentials among providers and (iv) formulary tiering\npractices.\nLaws and Regulations Related to the Retail/LTC Segment\nIn addition to the laws and regulations discussed above that may affect multiple segments of the Company’s business, the Company is subject to federal, state\nand local statutes and regulations governing the operation of its Retail/LTC segment specifically.

Although certain of the economic impacts of COVID-19 have moderated and the restrictions imposed as a result\nof COVID-19 have eased, a rise in infection rates, the development of new variants or viruses could result in, among other things, a return of the following: a\nreduction in discretionary utilization, the cancellation of elective medical procedures, reduced customer traffic and front store sales in our retail pharmacies, our\ncustomers being ordered to close or severely curtail their operations, the adoption of work-from-home policies and a reduction in diagnostic reporting due to\nreductions in health care provider visits and restrictions on our access to providers’ medical records, all of which have had a negative impact on our businesses.\nIn addition, as a result of legislative and/or regulatory responses to a rise in infection rates or the development of new variants or viruses, the premiums we\ncharge in our Insured Health Care Benefits products may prove to be insufficient to cover the cost of medical services delivered to our insured medical\nmembers, which may increase significantly as a result of higher utilization rates of medical facilities and services and other increases in associated hospital and\npharmaceutical costs.\nOver the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented various initiatives, such as COVID-19 related support programs for our customers, medical\nmembers and colleagues. If there is a rise in infection rates or the development of new variants or viruses, we may have to re-institute, extend or expand these\ninitiatives, which could adversely impact our businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition. In addition, measures that were imposed to\nlimit the spread of COVID-19 may also be re-instituted, which may lead to impacts including, but not limited to, complete or partial facility closures, labor\nshortages, financial difficulties of third-party providers, supply chain disruptions and re-introduction of remote work arrangements.

Our medical cost management programs may not be successful and may have a smaller impact on health care and benefit costs than we\nexpect. The factors described above may adversely affect our ability to predict and manage health care and other benefit costs, which can adversely affect our\ncompetitiveness and operating results.\nFurthermore, if we are not able to accurately and promptly anticipate and detect medical cost trends or accurately estimate the cost of incurred but not yet\nreported claims or reported claims that have not been paid, our ability to take timely corrective actions to limit future health care costs and reflect our current\nbenefit cost experience in our pricing process may be limited, which would further amplify the extent of any adverse impact on our operating results. These\nrisks are particularly acute during periods when health care and other benefit costs, utilization and/or medical cost trends experience significant volatility and\nmedical claim submission patterns are changing rapidly as a result of COVID-19. Such risks are further magnified by the ACA and other existing and future\nlegislation and regulations that limit our ability to price for our projected and/or experienced increases in utilization and/or medical cost trends.\nMany of the requirements set forth above may change once the PHE expires.

Accordingly, the Company believes excluding the amortization of\nintangible assets enhances the Company’s and investors’ ability to compare the Company’s past financial performance with its current performance and to analyze underlying business\nperformance and trends. Intangible asset amortization excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure represents the entire amount recorded within the Company’s GAAP financial\nstatements, and the revenue generated by the associated intangible assets has not been excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure. Intangible asset amortization is excluded from the\nrelated non-GAAP financial measure because the amortization, unlike the related revenue, is not affected by operations of any particular period unless an intangible asset becomes impaired or\nthe estimated useful life of an intangible asset is revised.\n(2)\nIn 2022, the office real estate optimization charges primarily relate to the abandonment of leased real estate and the related right-of-use assets and property and equipment in connection with the\nplanned reduction of corporate office real estate space in response to the Company’s new flexible work arrangement. The office real estate optimization charges are reflected in the Company’s\nGAAP consolidated statement of operations in operating expenses within the Health Care Benefits, Corporate/Other and Pharmacy Services segments.\n(3)\nIn 2022, the gain on divestiture of subsidiaries represents the pre-tax gain on the sale of bswift, which the Company sold in November 2022, and the pre-tax gain on the sale of PayFlex, which\nthe Company sold in June 2022.

The carrying value of the LTC business was determined to be greater than its estimated\nfair value less costs to sell and a loss on assets held for sale was recorded during the third quarter of 2022. As of December 31, 2022, the net assets of the LTC business continued to meet the\ncriteria for held-for-sale accounting and during the fourth quarter of 2022, an incremental loss on assets held for sale was recorded to write down the carrying value of the LTC business to its\nestimated fair value less costs to sell. During 2022, the loss on assets held for sale also relates to the Commercial Business reporting unit within the Health Care Benefits segment. In March\n2022, the Company reached an agreement to sell its international health care business domiciled in Thailand (“Thailand business”), which was included in the Commercial Business reporting\nunit.

The increase was primarily due to incremental costs associated with\nincreased volume, increased investments in the segment’s operations and capabilities, as well as decreased gains from legal settlements in 2022 compared\nto 2021.

The decrease in adjusted operating income was primarily driven\nby decreased COVID-19 vaccinations and diagnostic testing, continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure, increased investments in the segment’s\noperations and capabilities and decreased gains from legal settlements in 2022 compared to 2021.

The RBC framework described above for\ninsurers has been extended by the NAIC to health organizations, including HMOs.

Estimates and judgments are based on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to\nbe important at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, the Company reviews its accounting policies and how they are\napplied and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements. While the Company believes the historical experience, current trends and other factors\nconsidered by management support the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, actual\nresults could differ from estimates, and such differences could be material.\nSignificant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 ‘‘Significant Accounting Policies’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K.

Revenue is recognized based on customer billings,\nwhich, in the Company’s Commercial business, reflect contracted rates per member and the number of covered members recorded in the Company’s records at\nthe time the billings are prepared.

These adjustments are known\nas retroactivity adjustments. In each period, the Company estimates the amount of future retroactivity and adjusts the recorded revenue accordingly. As\ninformation regarding actual retroactivity amounts becomes known, the Company refines its estimates and records any required adjustments to revenues in the\nperiod in which they arise. A significant difference in the actual level of retroactivity compared to estimated levels would have a significant effect on the\nCompany’s operating results.\nPremium Revenue\nPremiums are recognized as revenue in the month in which the enrollee is entitled to receive health care services. Premiums are reported net of an allowance\nfor estimated terminations and uncollectible amounts. Additionally, premium revenue subject to the MLR rebate requirements of the ACA is recorded net of the\nestimated minimum MLR rebates for the current calendar year. Premiums related to unexpired contractual coverage periods (unearned premiums) are reported\nas other insurance liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized as revenue when earned.\nSome of the Company’s contracts allow for premiums to be adjusted to reflect actual experience or the relative health status of Insured members. Such\nadjustments are reasonably estimable at the outset of the contract, and adjustments to those estimates are made based on actual experience of the customer\nemerging under the contract and the terms of the underlying contract.\nServices Revenue\nServices revenue relates to contracts that can include various combinations of services or series of services which generally are capable of being distinct and\naccounted for as separate performance obligations. The Health Care Benefits segment’s services revenue primarily consists of ASC fees received in exchange\nfor performing certain claim processing and member services for ASC members. ASC fee revenue is recognized over the period the service is provided. Some\nof the Company’s administrative services contracts include guarantees with respect to certain functions, such as customer service response time, claim\nprocessing accuracy and claim processing turnaround time, as well as certain guarantees that a plan sponsor’s benefit claim experience will fall within a certain\nrange. With any of these guarantees, the Company is financially at risk if the conditions of the arrangements are not met, although the maximum amount at risk\ntypically is limited to a percentage of the fees otherwise payable to the Company by the customer involved.

The insurance premiums include a beneficiary premium, which is the responsibility of the PDP member, and can be subsidized by\nCMS in the case of low-income members, and a direct premium paid by CMS. Premiums collected in advance are initially recorded within other insurance\nliabilities and are then recognized ratably as revenue over the period in which members are entitled to receive benefits.\nRevenues also include a risk-sharing feature of the Medicare Part D program design referred to as the risk corridor. The Company estimates variable\nconsideration in the form of amounts payable to, or receivable from, CMS under the risk corridor, and adjusts revenue based on calculations of additional\nsubsidies to be received from or owed to CMS at the end of the reporting year.\nIn addition to Medicare Part D premiums, the Company receives additional payments each month from CMS related to catastrophic reinsurance, low-income\ncost-sharing subsidies and coverage gap benefits. If the subsidies received differ from the amounts earned from actual prescriptions transferred, the difference\nis recorded in either accounts receivable, net or accrued expenses.\nPharmacy Services Segment\nThe Pharmacy Services segment sells prescription drugs directly through its mail service dispensing pharmacies and indirectly through the Company’s retail\npharmacy network. The Company’s pharmacy benefit arrangements are accounted for in a manner consistent with a master supply arrangement as there are no\ncontractual minimum volumes and each prescription is considered a separate purchasing decision and distinct performance obligation transferred at a point in\ntime. PBM services performed in connection with each prescription claim are considered part of a single performance obligation which culminates in the\ndispensing of prescription drugs.\nThe Company recognizes revenue using the gross method at the contract price negotiated with its clients when the Company has concluded it controls the\nprescription drug before it is transferred to the client plan members. The Company controls prescriptions dispensed indirectly through its retail pharmacy\nnetwork because it has separate contractual arrangements with those pharmacies, has discretion in setting the price for the transaction and assumes primary\nresponsibility for fulfilling the promise to provide prescription drugs to its client plan members while also performing the related PBM services.\nRevenues include (i) the portion of the price the client pays directly to the Company, net of any discounts earned on brand name drugs or other discounts and\nrefunds paid back to the client (see “Drug Discounts” and “Guarantees” below), (ii) the price paid to the Company by client plan members for mail order\nprescriptions and the price paid to retail network pharmacies by client plan members for retail prescriptions (“retail co-payments”), and (i",

The Company has established the following revenue recognition policies for the\nPharmacy Services segment:\n•\nRevenues generated from prescription drugs sold by mail service dispensing pharmacies are recognized when the prescription drug is delivered to the\nclient plan member. At the time of delivery, the Company has performed substantially all of its performance obligations under its client contracts and does\nnot experience a significant level of returns or reshipments.\n•\nRevenues generated from prescription drugs sold by third party pharmacies in the Company’s retail pharmacy network and associated administrative fees\nare recognized at the Company’s point-of-sale, which is when the claim is adjudicated by the Company’s online claims processing system and the\nCompany has transferred control of the prescription drug and completed all of its performance obligations.\nFor contracts under which the Company acts as an agent or does not control the prescription drugs prior to transfer to the client plan member, revenue is\nrecognized using the net method.\nDrug Discounts\nThe Company records revenue net of manufacturers’ rebates earned by its clients based on their plan members’ utilization of brand-name formulary drugs. The\nCompany estimates these rebates at period-end based on actual and estimated claims data and its estimates of the manufacturers’ rebates earned by its clients.\nThe estimates are based on the best available data at period-end and recent history for the various factors that can affect the amount of rebates due to the client.\nThe Company adjusts its rebates\n94\n\n\npayable to clients to the actual amounts paid when these rebates are paid or as significant events occur. Any cumulative effect of these adjustments is recorded\nagainst revenues at the time it is identified. Adjustments generally result from contract changes with clients or manufacturers that have retroactive rebate\nadjustments, differences between the estimated and actual product mix subject to rebates, or whether the brand name drug was included in the applicable\nformulary. The effect of adjustments between estimated and actual manufacturers’ rebate amounts has not been material to the Company’s operating results or\nfinancial condition.\nGuarantees\nThe Company also adjusts revenues for refunds owed to clients resulting from pricing guarantees and performance against defined service and performance\nmetrics.

Any amounts not expected\nto be redeemed by customers (i.e., breakage) are recognized based on historical redemption patterns.\nCustomer returns are not material to the Company’s operating results or financial condition. Sales taxes are not included in revenues.\nLoyalty and Other Programs\nThe Company’s customer loyalty program, ExtraCare , consists of two components, ExtraSavings\n and ExtraBucks  Rewards. ExtraSavings are coupons that\nare recorded as a reduction of revenue when redeemed as the Company concluded that they do not represent a promise to the customer to deliver additional\ngoods or services at the time of issuance because they are not tied to a specific transaction or spending level.\nExtraBucks Rewards are accumulated by customers based on their historical spending levels. Thus, the Company has determined that there is an additional\nperformance obligation to those customers at the time of the initial transaction. The Company allocates the transaction price to the initial transaction and the\nExtraBucks Rewards transaction based upon the relative standalone selling price, which considers historical redemption patterns for the rewards. Revenue\nallocated to ExtraBucks Rewards is recognized as those rewards are redeemed. At the end of each period, unredeemed ExtraBucks Rewards are reflected as a\ncontract liability.\nThe Company also offers a subscription-based membership program, CarePass , under which members are entitled to a suite of benefits delivered over the\ncourse of the subscription period, as well as a promotional reward that can be redeemed for future goods and services.

The Company monitors its\nrevenues and receivables from these reimbursement sources, as well as long-term care facilities and other third party insurance payors, and reduces revenue at\nthe revenue recognition date to properly account for the variable consideration due to anticipated differences between billed and reimbursed amounts.\nAccordingly, the total revenues and receivables reported in the Company’s consolidated financial statements are recorded at the amount expected to be\nultimately received from these payors.\n®\nTM\n®\n®\n95\n\n\nPatient co-payments associated with Medicare Part D, certain state Medicaid programs, Medicare Part B and certain third party payors typically are not\ncollected at the time products are delivered or services are rendered, but are billed to the individuals as part of normal billing procedures and subject to normal\naccounts receivable collections procedures.\nWalk-In Medical Clinics\nFor services provided by the Company’s walk-in medical clinics, revenue recognition occurs for completed services provided to patients, with adjustments\ntaken for third party payor contractual obligations and patient direct bill historical collection rates.\nImpairments of Debt Securities\nThe Company regularly reviews its debt securities to determine whether a decline in fair value below the cost basis or carrying value has occurred. If a debt\nsecurity is in an unrealized loss position and the Company has the intent to sell the security, or it is more likely than not that the Company will have to sell the\nsecurity before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the amortized cost basis of the security is written down to its fair value and the difference is recognized in\nnet income. If a debt security is in an unrealized loss position and the Company does not have the intent to sell and it is more likely than not that the Company\nwill not have to sell such security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the Company bifurcates the impairment into credit-related and non-credit related\n(yield-related) components. The amount of the credit-related component is recorded as an allowance for credit losses and recognized in net income, and the\namount of the non-credit related component is included in other comprehensive income (loss). The Company analyzes all facts and circumstances believed to\nbe relevant for each investment when performing this analysis, in accordance with applicable accounting guidance.\nIn evaluating whether a credit related loss exists, the Company considers a vari",

For unrealized losses determined to be\nthe result of market conditions (for example, increasing interest rates and volatility due to conditions in the overall market) or industry-related events, the\nCompany determines whether it intends to sell the debt security or if it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the debt security prior\nto the anticipated recovery of the debt security’s amortized cost basis. If either case is true, the Company recognizes a non-credit related impairment, and the\ncost basis or carrying amount of the debt security is written down to fair value.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded yield-related impairment losses on debt securities of $143 million, $42\nmillion and $49 million, respectively.

Unexpected changes to market factors and circumstances that\nwere not present in past reporting periods are among the factors that may result in a current period decision to sell debt securities that were not impaired in\nprior reporting periods.\nVendor Allowances and Purchase Discounts\nVendor and manufacturer receivables were $12.4 billion and $10.6 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, the majority of which relate to\npurchase discounts and vendor allowances as described below.\nPharmacy Services Segment\nThe Pharmacy Services segment receives purchase discounts on products purchased.

The Pharmacy Services segment also receives additional discounts under its wholesaler contracts if it exceeds\ncontractually defined purchase volumes. In addition, the Pharmacy Services segment receives fees from pharmaceutical manufacturers for administrative\nservices. Purchase discounts and administrative service fees are recorded as a reduction of cost of products sold.\nRetail/LTC Segment\nVendor allowances received by the Retail/LTC segment reduce the carrying cost of inventory and are recognized in cost of products sold when the related\ninventory is sold, unless they are specifically identified as a reimbursement of incremental costs for promotional programs and/or other services provided.\nAmounts that are directly linked to advertising commitments are recognized as a reduction of advertising expense (included in operating expenses) when the\nrelated advertising commitment is satisfied.

For real estate leases, the\noptions to extend are not considered reasonably certain at lease commencement because the Company reevaluates each lease on a regular basis to consider the\neconomic and strategic incentives of exercising the renewal options and regularly opens or closes stores to align with its operating strategy. Generally, the\nrenewal option periods are not included within the lease term and the associated payments are not included in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and\nlease liability. Similarly, renewal options are not included in the lease term for non-real estate leases because they are not considered reasonably certain of\nbeing exercised at lease commencement. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheets, and lease expense is\nrecognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the short-term lease.\nFor real estate leases, the Company accounts for lease components and nonlease components as a single lease component. Certain real estate leases require\nadditional payments based on sales volume, as well as reimbursement for real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance, which are expensed as\nincurred as variable lease costs. Other real estate leases contain one fixed lease payment that includes real estate taxes, common area maintenance and\ninsurance.

As part of this initiative, the Company evaluated its current real estate space and changes in employee work arrangement requirements to ensure it\nhad the appropriate space to support the business. As a result of this assessment, the Company determined that it would vacate and abandon certain leased\ncorporate office spaces.

The impairment test is performed by comparing the reporting unit’s fair value with its net book value (or carrying\namount), including goodwill. The fair value of the reporting units is estimated using a combination of a discounted cash flow method and a market multiple\nmethod. If the net book value (carrying amount) of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the reporting unit’s goodwill is considered to be impaired, and an\nimpairment is recognized in an amount equal to the excess.\nThe determination of the fair value of the reporting units requires the Company to make significant assumptions and estimates.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nThe Company’s earnings and financial condition are exposed to interest rate risk, credit quality risk, market valuation risk, foreign currency risk, commodity\nrisk and operational risk.\nEvaluation of Interest Rate and Credit Quality Risk\nThe Company manages interest rate risk by seeking to maintain a tight match between the durations of assets and liabilities when appropriate. The Company\nmanages credit quality risk by seeking to maintain high average credit quality ratings and diversified sector exposure within its debt securities portfolio. In\nconnection with its investment and risk management objectives, the Company also uses derivative financial instruments whose market value is at least partially\ndetermined by, among other things, levels of or changes in interest rates (short-term or long-term), duration, prepayment rates, equity markets or credit\nratings/spreads. The Company’s use of these derivatives is generally limited to hedging risk and has principally consisted of using interest rate swaps, treasury\nrate locks, forward contracts, futures contracts, warrants, put options and credit default swaps. These instruments, viewed separately, subject the Company to\nvarying degrees of interest rate, equity price and credit risk. However, when used for",

See Note 2 ‘‘Acquisitions, Divestitures and Asset Sales’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\nInvestment risks associated with experience-rated products generally do not impact the Company’s operating results. The risks associated with investments\nsupporting experience-rated pension and annuity products in the large case pensions business in the Company’s Corporate/Other segment are assumed by the\ncontract holders and not by the Company (subject to, among other things, certain minimum guarantees). Assets supporting experience-rated products may be\nsubject to contract holder or participant withdrawals.\nThe debt securities in the Company’s investment portfolio had an average credit quality rating of A at both December 31, 2022 and 2021, with a fair value of\napproximately $6.0 billion and $6.7 billion rated AAA at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The fair value of debt securities that were rated below\ninvestment grade (that is, having a credit quality rating below BBB-/Baa3) was $1.9 billion and $2.3 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively (of\nwhich 1.6% and 2.0% at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, supported experience-rated products).\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company held $202 million and $305 million, respectively, of municipal debt securities that were guaranteed by third\nparties, representing 1% of total investments at both December 31, 2022 and 2021. These securities had an average credit quality rating of AA+ and AA at\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, with the guarantee. These securities had an average credit quality rating of A at both December 31, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively, without the guarantee. The Company does not have any significant concentration of investments with third party guarantors (either direct or\nindirect).\nThe Company generally classifies debt securities as available for sale, and carries them at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets. At both December 31,\n2022 and 2021, less than 1% of debt securities were valued using inputs that reflect the Company’s assumptions (categorized as Level 3 inputs in accordance\nwith accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America). See Note 4 ‘‘Fair Value’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional\ninformation on the methodologies and key assumptions used to determine the fair value of investments.

If a debt security is in an unrealized loss\nposition and the Company does not have the intent to sell and it is more likely than not that the Company will not have to sell such security before recovery of\nits amortized cost basis, the Company bifurcates the impairment into credit-related and non-credit related components. The amount of the credit-related\ncomponent is recorded as an allowance for credit losses and recognized in net income, and the amount of the non-credit related component is included in other\ncomprehensive income (loss). The impairment of debt securities is considered a critical accounting policy. See ‘‘Critical Accounting Policies - Impairments of\nDebt Securities” in the MD&A included in Item 7 of this 10-K for additional information.\nEvaluation of Market Valuation Risks\nThe Company regularly evaluates its risk from market-sensitive instruments by examining, among other things, levels of or changes in interest rates (short-term\nor long-term), duration, prepayment rates, equity markets and/or credit ratings/spreads. The Company also regularly evaluates the appropriateness of\ninvestments relative to management-approved investment guidelines (and operates within those guidelines) and the business objectives of its portfolios.\nOn a quarterly basis, the Company reviews the impact of hypothetical net losses in its investment portfolio on the Company’s consolidated near-term financial\ncondition, operating results and cash flows assuming the occurrence of certain reasonably possible changes in near-term market rates and prices. Interest rate\nchanges (whether resulting from changes in treasury yields or credit spreads or other factors) represent the most material risk exposure category for the\nCompany. The Company has estimated the impact on the fair value of market sensitive instruments based on the net present value of cash flows using a\nrepresentative set of likely future interest rate scenarios. The assumptions used were as follows: an immediate increase of 100 basis points in interest rates\n(which the Company believes represents a moderately adverse scenario) for long-term debt issued by the Company, as well as its interest rate sensitive\ninvestments and an immediate decrease of 15% in prices for publicly traded domestic equity securities in the Company’s investment portfolio.\nAssuming an immediate inc",

Changes in the fair value of\nlong-term debt do not impact the Company’s operating results or financial condition.\n•\nThe theoretical reduction in the fair value of interest rate sensitive investments partially offset by the theoretical reduction in the fair value of interest rate\nsensitive liabilities would result in a net decline in fair value of approximately $595 million ($750 million pretax) related to continuing non-experience-\nrated products. Reductions in the fair value of investment securities would be reflected as an unrealized loss in equity, as the Company classifies these debt\nsecurities as available for sale. The Company does not record liabilities at fair value.\nIf the value of the Company’s publicly traded domestic equity securities held within its investment portfolio were to decline by 15%, this would result in a net\ndecline in fair value of $20 million ($26 million pretax).\nBased on overall exposure to interest rate risk and equity price risk, the Company believes that these changes in market rates and prices would not materially\naffect consolidated near-term financial condition, operating results or cash flows as of December 31, 2022.\nEvaluation of Foreign Currency and Commodity Risk\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company did not have any material foreign currency exchange rate or commodity derivative instruments in place and\nbelieves its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk is not material.\nEvaluation of Operational Risks\nThe Company also faces certain operational risks. Those risks include risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic and risks related to information security,\nincluding cybersecurity.\nThe spread of COVID-19, or actions taken to mitigate its spread, could have material and adverse effects on our ability to operate our businesses effectively,\nincluding as a result of the complete or partial closure of facilities or labor shortages.

See Note 2 ‘‘Acquisitions, Divestitures and Asset Sales’’\nfor additional information on the Company’s sale of PayFlex.\n113\n\n\nInvestments\nDebt Securities\nDebt securities consist primarily of U.S. Treasury and agency securities, mortgage-backed securities, corporate and foreign bonds and other debt securities.\nDebt securities are classified as either current or long-term investments based on their contractual maturities unless the Company intends to sell an investment\nwithin the next twelve months, in which case it is classified as current on the consolidated balance sheets. Debt securities are classified as available for sale and\nare carried at fair value. See Note 4 ‘‘Fair Value’’ for additional information on how the Company estimates the fair value of these investments.\nIf a debt security is in an unrealized loss position and the Company has the intent to sell the security, or it is more likely than not that the Company will have to\nsell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the amortized cost basis of the security is written down to its fair value and the difference is\nrecognized in net income. If a debt security is in an unrealized loss position and the Company does not have the intent to sell and it is more likely than not that\nthe Company will not have to sell such security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the Company bifurcates the impairment into credit-related and non-\ncredit related (yield-related) components.

The amount of the credit-related component is recorded as an allowance for credit losses and recognized in net income, and the\namount of the non-credit related component is included in other comprehensive income (loss). Interest is not accrued on debt securities when management\nbelieves the collection of interest is unlikely.\nThe credit-related component is determined by comparing the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security, considering all reasonably\navailable information relevant to the collectability of the security, with the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be\ncollected is less than the amortized cost basis of the security, the Company records an allowance for credit losses, which is limited by the amount that the fair\nvalue is less than amortized cost basis.\nFor mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities, the Company recognizes income using an effective yield based on anticipated prepayments and the\nestimated economic life of the securities. When estimates of prepayments change, the effective yield is recalculated to reflect actual payments to date and\nanticipated future payments. The Company’s investment in the security is adjusted to the amount that would have existed had the new effective yield been\napplied since the acquisition of the security, with adjustments recognized in net income.\nEquity Securities\nEquity securities with readily available fair values are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income.\nMortgage Loans\nMortgage loan investments on the consolidated balance sheets are valued at the unpaid principal balance, net of an allowance for credit losses. Mortgage loans\nwith a maturity date or a committed prepayment date within twelve months are classified as current on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company assesses\nwhether its loans share similar risk characteristics and, if so, groups such loans in a risk pool when measuring expected credit losses. The Company considers\nthe following characteristics when evaluating whether its loans share similar risk characteristics: loan-to-value ratios, property type (e.g., office, retail,\napartment, industrial), geographic location, vacancy rates and property condition.\nCredit loss reserves are determined using a loss rate method that multiplies the unpaid principal balance of each loan within a risk pool group by an estimated\nloss rate percentage. The loss rate percentage considers both the expected loan loss severity and the probability of loan default.

Interest income on problem loans (i.e., more than 60 days delinquent, in bankruptcy or in\nprocess of foreclosure) is recognized on a cash basis. Cash payments on loans in the process of foreclosure are treated as a return of principal.\n114\n\n\nOther Investments\nOther investments consist primarily of the following:\n•\nPrivate equity and hedge fund limited partnerships, which are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Under this method, the carrying value\nof the investment is based on the value of the Company’s equity ownership of the underlying investment funds provided by the general partner or manager\nof the investments, the financial statements of which generally are audited. As a result of the timing of the receipt of the valuation information provided by\nthe fund managers, these investments are generally reported on up to a three month lag. The Company reviews investments for impairment at least\nquarterly and monitors their performance throughout the year through discussions with the administrators, managers and/or general partners. If the\nCompany becomes aware of an impairment of a limited partnership’s investments through its review or prior to receiving the limited partnership’s\nfinancial statements at the financial statement date, an impairment will be recognized by recording a reduction in the carrying value of the limited\npartnership with a corresponding charge to net investment income.\n•\nInvestment real estate, which is carried on the consolidated balance sheets at depreciated cost, including capital additions, net of write-downs for other-\nthan-temporary declines in fair value. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful life of each asset. If any real\nestate investment is considered held-for-sale, it is carried at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less estimated selling costs. The Company\ngenerally estimates fair value using net operating income and applying a capitalization rate in conjunction with comparable sales information. At the time\nof the sale, the difference between the sales price and the carrying value is recorded as a realized capital gain or loss.\n•\nPrivately-placed equity securities, which are carried on the consolidated balance sheets at cost less impairments, plus or minus subsequent adjustments for\nobservable price changes.

Experience-rated products are products in the large case pensions business where the contract holder,\nnot the Company, assumes investment and other risks, subject to, among other things, minimum guarantees provided by the Company. The effect of investment\nperformance on experience-rated products is allocated to contract holders’ accounts daily, based on the underlying investment experience and, therefore, does\nnot impact the Company’s net income (as long as the contract’s minimum guarantees are not triggered). Net investment income on assets supporting large case\npensions’ experience-rated products is included in net investment income in the consolidated statements of operations and is credited to contract holders’\naccounts through a charge to benefit costs. The contract holders’ accounts are reflected in policyholders’ funds on the consolidated balance sheets.\nRealized capital gains and losses on investments (other than realized capital gains and losses on investments supporting experience-rated products) are included\nas a component of net investment income in the consolidated statements of operations. Realized capital gains and losses are determined on a specific\nidentification basis. Purchases and sales of debt and equity securities and alternative investments are reflected on the trade date. Purchases and sales of\nmortgage loans and investment real estate are reflected on the closing date.\nRealized capital gains and losses on investments supporting large case pensions’ experience-rated products are not included in realized capital gains and losses\nin the consolidated statements of operations and instead are credited directly to contract holders’ accounts.

During the interim\nperiod between physical inventory counts, the Company accrues for anticipated physical inventory losses on a location-by-location basis based on historical\nresults and current physical inventory trends.\nReinsurance Recoverables\nThe Company utilizes reinsurance agreements primarily to: (a) reduce required capital and (b) facilitate the acquisition or disposition of certain insurance\ncontracts. Ceded reinsurance agreements permit the Company to recover a portion of its losses from reinsurers, although they do not discharge the Company’s\nprimary liability as the direct insurer of the risks reinsured. Failure of reinsurers to indemnify the Company could result in losses; however, the Company does\nnot expect charges for unrecoverable reinsurance to have a material effect on its consolidated operating results or financial condition.

See Note 6 ‘‘Leases’’ for additional information\nabout these impairment charges as well as the Company’s finance leases.\nRight-of-Use Assets and Lease Liabilities\nThe Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at the inception of a contract. Right-of-use assets represent the Company’s right to use an\nunderlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Right-of-use assets\nand lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date of the lease, renewal date of the lease or significant remodeling of the lease space based on the\npresent value of the remaining future minimum lease payments. As the interest rate implicit in the Company’s leases is not readily determinable, the Company\nutilizes its incremental borrowing rate, determined by class of underlying asset, to discount the lease payments. The operating lease right-of-use assets also\ninclude lease payments made before commencement and are reduced by lease incentives.\nThe Company’s real estate leases typically contain options that permit renewals for additional periods of up to five years each. For real estate leases, the\noptions to extend are not considered reasonably certain at lease commencement because the Company reevaluates each lease on a regular basis to consider the\neconomic and strategic incentives of exercising the renewal options and regularly opens or closes stores to align with its operating strategy. Generally, the\nrenewal option periods are not included within the lease term and the associated payments are not included in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and\nlease liability. Similarly, renewal options are not included in the lease term for non-real estate leases because they are not considered reasonably certain of\nbeing exercised at lease commencement. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheets, and lease expense is\nrecognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the short-term lease.\nFor real estate leases, the Company accounts for lease components and nonlease components as a single lease component. Certain real estate leases require\nadditional payments based on sales volume, as well as reimbursement for real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance, which are expensed as\nincurred as variable lease costs. Other real estate leases contain one fixed lease payment that includes real estate taxes, common area maintenance and\ninsurance. These fixed payments are considered part of the lease payment and included in the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities.\nSee",

See Note 5 ‘‘Goodwill and Other Intangibles’’ for additional information about goodwill.\nIntangible Assets\nThe Company’s identifiable intangible assets consist primarily of trademarks, trade names, customer contracts/relationships, covenants not to compete,\ntechnology, provider networks and value of business acquired (“VOBA”). These intangible assets arise primarily from the determination of their respective fair\nmarket values at the date of acquisition. Amounts assigned to identifiable intangible assets, and their related useful lives, are derived from established valuation\ntechniques and management estimates.\nThe Company’s definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives based upon the pattern of future cash flows attributable to the\nasset. Other than VOBA, definite-lived intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method. VOBA is amortized over the expected life of the acquired\ncontracts in proportion to estimated premiums. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently, if\nnecessary, as further described in “Recoverability of Long-Lived Assets” below.\nSee Note 5 ‘‘Goodwill and Other Intangibles’’ for additional information about intangible assets.\nRecoverability of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets, excluding goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are tested for impairment using\nseparate tests described below, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such asset may not be recoverable. The\nCompany groups and evaluates these long-lived assets for impairment at the lowest level at which individual cash flows can be identified. If indicators of\nimpairment are present, the Company first compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset group\n(undiscounted). If the estimated future cash flows used in this analysis are less than the carrying amount of the asset group, an impairment loss calculation is\nprepared. The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the asset group’s estimated future cash flows (discounted). If\nrequired, an impairment loss is recorded for the portion of the asset group’s carrying value that exceeds the asset group’s estimated future cash flow",

There were no material impairment charges recognized on long-lived assets during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nSee Note 6 ‘‘Leases’’ for additional information about the right-of-use asset charges.\nWhen evaluating goodwill for potential impairment, the Company compares the fair value of its reporting units to their respective carrying amounts. The\nCompany estimates the fair value of its reporting units using a combination of a discounted cash flow method and a market multiple method. If the carrying\namount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. During the third quarter of both\n2022 and 2020, the Company performed its required annual impairment tests of goodwill and concluded there were no goodwill impairments as of the testing\ndates or during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2020.

Accordingly, during the third quarter of 2021,\nthe Company recorded a $431 million goodwill impairment charge on the remaining goodwill of the LTC reporting unit. The results of the impairment tests\nindicated that there was no impairment of goodwill of the remaining reporting units as of the testing date or during the year ended December 31, 2021. See\nNote 5 ‘‘Goodwill and Other Intangibles’’ for additional information about the goodwill impairment charge recorded during the year ended December 31, 2021.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value. The Company estimates the\nfair value of its indefinite-lived trademarks using the relief from royalty method under the\n118\n\n\nincome approach. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized, and the asset is written down to its\nestimated fair value.

Unpaid health care claims include an estimate of payments the Company will make for (i) services rendered to the Company’s Insured\nmembers but not yet reported to the Company and (ii) claims which have been reported to the Company but not yet paid, each as of the financial statement date\n(collectively, “IBNR”). Health care costs payable also include an estimate of the cost of services that will continue to be rendered after the financial statement\ndate if the Company is obligated to pay for such services in accordance with contractual or regulatory requirements. Such estimates are developed using\nactuarial principles and assumptions which consider, among other things, historical and projected claim submission and processing patterns, assumed and\nhistorical medical cost trends, historical utilization of medical services, claim inventory levels, changes in Insured membership and product mix, seasonality\nand other relevant factors.

In developing its IBNR estimate, the\nCompany consistently applies these actuarial principles and assumptions each period, with consideration to the variability of related factors. There have been\nno significant changes to the methodologies or assumptions used to develop the Company’s estimate of IBNR in 2022.\nThe Company analyzes historical claim payment patterns by comparing claim incurred dates (i.e., the date services were provided) to claim payment dates to\nestimate “completion factors.” The Company uses completion factors predominantly to estimate the ultimate cost of claims incurred more than three months\nbefore the financial statement date. The Company estimates completion factors by aggregating claim data based on the month of service and month of claim\npayment and estimating the percentage of claims incurred for a given month that are complete by each month thereafter. For any given month, substantially all\nclaims are paid within six months of the date of service, but it can take up to 48 months or longer after the date of service before all of the claims are\ncompletely resolved and paid. These historically-derived completion factors are then applied to claims paid through the financial statement date to estimate the\nultimate claim cost for a given month’s incurred claim activity. The difference between the estimated ultimate claim cost and the claims paid through the\nfinancial statement date represents the Company’s estimate of claims remaining to be paid as of the financial statement date and is included in the Company’s\nhealth care costs payable. The completion factors the Company uses reflect judgments and possible adjustments based on data such as claim inventory levels,\nclaim submission and processing patterns and, to a lesser extent, other factors such as changes in health care cost trend rates, changes in Insured membership\nand changes in product mix. If claims are submitted or processed on a faster (slower) pace than prior periods, the actual claims may be more (less) complete\nthan originally estimated using the Company’s completion factors, which may result in reserves that are higher (lower) than the ultimate cost of claims.\nBecause claims incurred within three months before the financial statement date are less mature, the Company uses a combination of historically-derived\ncompletion factors and the assumed health care cost trend rate to estimate the ultimate cost\n119\n\n\nof claims incurred for these months. The Company applies its actuarial judgment and places a greater emphasis on the assumed health care cost trend rate for\nthe most recent claim incurred dates as these months may be influenced by seasonal patterns and changes in membership and product mix.\nThe Company’s health care cost trend rate is affected by changes in per member utilization of medical services as well as changes in the unit cost of such\nservices.

The health status of the Company’s Insured\nmembers, aging of the population and other demographic characteristics, advances in medical technology and other factors continue to contribute to rising per\nmember utilization and unit costs. Changes in health care practices, inflation, new technologies, increases in the cost of prescription drugs (including specialty\npharmacy drugs), direct-to-consumer marketing by pharmaceutical companies, clusters of high-cost cases, claim intensity, changes in the regulatory\nenvironment, health care provider or member fraud and numerous other factors also contribute to the cost of health care and the Company’s health care cost\ntrend rate.\nFor each reporting period, the Company uses an extensive degree of judgment in the process of estimating its health care costs payable. As a result,\nconsiderable variability and uncertainty is inherent in such estimates, particularly with respect to claims with claim incurred dates of three months or less\nbefore the financial statement date; and the adequacy of such estimates is highly sensitive to changes in assumed completion factors and the assumed health\ncare cost trend rates. For each reporting period the Company recognizes the actuarial best estimate of health care costs payable considering the potential\nvolatility in assumed completion factors and health care cost trend rates, as well as other factors. The Company believes its estimate of health care costs\npayable is reasonable and adequate to cover its obligations at December 31, 2022; however, actual claim payments may differ from the Company’s estimates. A\nworsening (or improvement) of the Company’s health care cost trend rates or changes in completion factors from those that the Company assumed in\nestimating health care costs payable at December 31, 2022 would cause these estimates to change in the near term, and such a change could be material.\nEach quarter, the Company re-examines previously established health care costs payable estimates based on actual claim payments for prior periods and other\nchanges in facts and circumstances. Given the extensive degree of judgment in this estimate, it is possible that the Company’s estimates of health care costs\npayable could develop either favorably (that is, its actual benefit costs for the period were less than estimated) or unfavorably. The changes in the Company’s\nestimate of health care costs payable may relate to a prior quarter, prior year or earlier periods.

Anticipated investment income is not considered in the calculation of premium deficiency losses for\nshort-duration contracts.

          "chunk": "ealth Care Benefits Segment\nHealth Care Benefits revenue is principally derived from insurance premiums and fees billed to customers. Revenue is recognized based on customer billings,\nwhich, in the Company’s Commercial business, reflect contracted rates per member and the number of covered members recorded in the Company’s records at\nthe time the billings are prepared. Billings are generally sent monthly for coverage during the following month. Revenue related to the Company’s Government\nbusiness is collected monthly from the U.S. federal government and various government agencies based on fixed payment rates and member eligibility.\nThe Company’s billings may be subsequently adjusted to reflect enrollment changes due to member terminations or other factors. These adjustments are known\nas retroactivity adjustments. In each period, the Company estimates the amount of future retroactivity and adjusts the recorded revenue accordingly. As\ninformation regarding actual retroactivity amounts becomes known, the Company refines its estimates and records any required adjustments to revenues in the\nperiod in which they arise.\nPremium Revenue\nPremiums are recognized as revenue in the month in which the enrollee is entitled to receive health care services. Premiums are reported net of an allowance\nfor estimated terminations and uncollectible amounts. Additionally, premium revenue subject to the minimum medical loss ratio (“MLR”) rebate requirements\nof the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (as amended, collectively, the “ACA”) is\nrecorded net of the estimated minimum MLR rebates for the current calendar year. Premiums related to unexpired contractual coverage periods (unearned\npremiums) are reported as other insurance liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized as revenue when earned.\nSome of the Company’s contracts allow for premiums to be adjusted to reflect actual experience or the relative health status of Insured members. Such\nadjustments are reasonably estimable at the outset of the contract, and adjustments to those estimates are made based on actual experience of the customer\nemerging under the contract and the terms of the underlying contract.\nServices Revenue\nServices revenue relates to contracts that can include various combinations of services or series of services which generally are capable of being distinct and\naccounted for as separate performance obligations. The Health Care Benefits segment’s services revenue primarily consists of ASC fees received in exchange\nfor performing certain claim processing and member services for ASC members. ASC fee revenue is recognized over the period the service is provided. Some\nof the Company’s administrative services contracts include guarantees with respect to certain functions, such as customer service response time, claim\nprocessing accuracy and claim processing turnaround time, as well as certain guarantees that a plan ",

With any of these guarantees, the Company is financially at risk if the conditions of the arrangements are not met, although the maximum amount at risk\ntypically is limited to a percentage of the fees otherwise payable to the Company by the customer involved. Each period the Company estimates its obligations\nunder the terms of these guarantees and records its estimate as an offset to services revenues.\nAccounting for Medicare Part D\nRevenues include insurance premiums earned by the Company’s PDPs, which are determined based on the PDP’s annual bid and related contractual\narrangements with the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”). The insurance\n122\n\n\npremiums include a beneficiary premium, which is the responsibility of the PDP member, and can be subsidized by CMS in the case of low-income members,\nand a direct premium paid by CMS. Premiums collected in advance are initially recorded within other insurance liabilities and are then recognized ratably as\nrevenue over the period in which members are entitled to receive benefits.\nRevenues also include a risk-sharing feature of the Medicare Part D program design referred to as the risk corridor. The Company estimates variable\nconsideration in the form of amounts payable to, or receivable from, CMS under the risk corridor, and adjusts revenue based on calculations of additional\nsubsidies to be received from or owed to CMS at the end of the reporting year.\nIn addition to Medicare Part D premiums, the Company receives additional payments each month from CMS related to catastrophic reinsurance, low-income\ncost-sharing subsidies and coverage gap benefits. If the subsidies received differ from the amounts earned from actual prescriptions transferred, the difference\nis recorded in either accounts receivable, net or accrued expenses.\nPharmacy Services Segment\nThe Pharmacy Services segment sells prescription drugs directly through its mail service dispensing pharmacies and indirectly through the Company’s retail\npharmacy network. The Company’s pharmacy benefit arrangements are accounted for in a manner consistent with a master supply arrangement as there are no\ncontractual minimum volumes and each prescription is considered a separate purchasing decision and distinct performance obligation transferred at a point in\ntime. PBM services performed in connection with each prescription claim are considered part of a single performance obligation which culminates in the\ndispensing of prescription drugs.\nThe Company recognizes revenue using the gross method at the contract price negotiated with its clients when the Company has concluded it controls the\nprescription drug before it is transferred to the client plan members. The Company controls prescriptions dispensed indirectly through its retail pharmacy\nnetwork because it has separate contractual arrangements with those pharmacies, has discretion in setting the pr",

The\nCompany estimates these rebates at period-end based on actual and estimated claims data and its estimates of the manufacturers’ rebates earned by its clients.\nThe estimates are based on the best available data at period-end and recent history for the various factors that can affect the amount of rebates due to the client.\nThe Company adjusts its rebates payable to clients to the actual amounts paid when these rebates are paid or as significant events occur.

Thus, the Company has determined that there is an additional\nperformance obligation to those customers at the time of the initial transaction. The Company allocates the transaction price to the initial transaction and the\nExtraBucks Rewards transaction based upon the relative standalone selling price, which considers historical redemption patterns for the rewards.

The Company establishes a valuation allowance when it does not consider\nit more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered.\nThe Company records uncertain tax positions on the basis of a two-step process whereby (1) the Company determines whether it is more likely than not that the\ntax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition\nthreshold, the Company recognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax\nauthority.\nInterest and/or penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in the income tax provision.\nMeasurement of Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Employee Benefit Plans\nThe Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans (“pension plans”) and other postretirement employee benefit plans (“OPEB plans”) for its employees and\nretirees. The Company recognizes the funded status of its pension and OPEB plans on the consolidated balance sheets based on the year-end measurements of\nplan assets and benefit obligations. When the fair value of plan assets are in excess of the plan benefit obligations, the amounts are reported in other current\nassets and other assets. When the fair value of plan benefit obligations are in excess of plan assets, the amounts are reported in accrued expenses and other\nlong-term liabilities based on the amount by which the actuarial present value of benefits payable in the next twelve months included in the benefit obligation\nexceeds the fair value of plan assets. The net periodic benefit income for the Company’s pension and OPEB plans do not contain a service cost component as\nthese plans have been frozen for an extended period of time. Non-service cost components of pension and postretirement net periodic benefit income are\nincluded in other income in the consolidated statements of operations.\nEarnings per Share\nEarnings per share is computed using the treasury stock method.

The Red Oak arrangement had an initial term of ten years. In 2021, the Red Oak arrangement was amended\nto extend the initial term an additional five years, for a total term of 15 years. Under this arrangement, the Company and Cardinal contributed their sourcing\nand supply chain expertise to Red Oak and agreed to source and negotiate generic pharmaceutical supply contracts for both companies through Red Oak;\nhowever, Red Oak does not own or hold inventory on behalf of either company. No physical assets (e.g., property and equipment) were contributed to Red Oak\nby either company, and minimal funding was provided to capitalize Red Oak. The Company has determined that it is the primary beneficiary of this VIE\nbecause it has the ability to direct the activities of Red Oak. Consequently, the Company consolidates Red Oak in its consolidated financial statements within\nthe Retail/LTC segment.\nCardinal is required to pay the Company quarterly payments, which began in October 2014 and will extend through June 2029. As milestones are met, the\nquarterly payments increase. The Company received $183 million from Cardinal during each of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.

This standard requires the Company to review cash flow assumptions for its long-duration insurance contracts at least annually and recognize the\neffect of changes in future cash flow assumptions in net income. This standard also requires the Company to update discount rate assumptions quarterly and\nrecognize the effect of changes in these assumptions in other comprehensive income (loss). The rate used to discount the Company’s liability for future policy\nbenefits will be based on an estimate of the yield for an upper-medium grade fixed-income instrument with a duration profile matching that of the Company’s\nliabilities. In addition, this standard changes the amortization method for deferred acquisition costs and requires additional disclosures regarding the long\nduration insurance contract liabilities in the Company’s interim and annual financial statements. The standard is effective for public companies for fiscal years,\nand interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company adopted this accounting standard on January 1, 2023, using the\nmodified retrospective transition method as of the earliest period presented, January 1, 2021, also referred to as the transition date, for changes primarily related\nto the liability for future policy benefits and deferred acquisition costs. The Company is still in the process of finalizing the impact of the new standard on its\nhistorical financial statements, but expects to record an increase to its liability for future policy benefits with a corresponding change in accumulated other\ncomprehensive income on the transition date of approximately $1 billion as a result of updating the rate used to discount the liabilities to reflect the yield for an\nupper-medium grade fixed-income instrument compared to the Company’s expected investment yield under the existing guidance.\n131\n\n\n2.\nAcquisitions, Divestitures and Asset Sales\nProposed Oak Street Health Acquisition\nOn February 7, 2023, the Company entered into a definitive merger agreement to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Oak Street Health, Inc.

Accordingly, in the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded office real estate optimization charges of\n$117 million, primarily consisting of $71 million related to operating lease right-of-use assets and $44 million related to property and equipment, within the\nHealth Care Benefits, Corporate/Other and Pharmacy Services segments.\nStore Impairment Charges\nThe Company evaluates its retail store right-of-use and property and equipment assets for impairment at the retail store level, which is the lowest level at which\ncash flows can be identified. For retail stores where there is an indicator of impairment present, the Company first compares the carrying amount of the asset\ngroup to the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset group (undiscounted). If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows used in the analysis are\nless than the carrying amount of the asset group, an impairment loss calculation is prepared. The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying amount of\nthe asset group to its estimated fair value which is the greater of the asset group’s estimated future cash flows (discounted), or the consideration of what a\nmarket participant would pay to lease the assets, net of leasing costs. The Company’s estimate of fair value considers historical results, current operating trends,\nconsolidated sales, profitability and cash flow results and forecasts. For assets which the Company has determined it will be able to sublease, the estimated\nfuture cash flows include the estimated sublease income, net of estimated leasing costs.\nWhen the carrying value of an asset group exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recorded to reduce the value of the asset group to its estimated\nfair value. As the impaired assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis primarily using unobservable inputs as of the measurement date, the assets\nare classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company completed a strategic review of its retail business and announced the creation of new formats for its stores to\ncontinue to drive higher engagement with customers. As part of this review, the Company evaluated changes in population, consumer buying patterns and\nfuture health needs to ensure it has the right kinds of stores in the right locations for consumers and for the business. In connection with this initiative, on\nNovember 17, 2021, the Board of Directors of CVS Health Corporation (the “Board”) authorized the closing of approximately 900 retail stores, approximately\n300 stores each year, between 2022 and 2024. As a result, management determined that there were indicators of impairment with respect to the impacted stores’\nasset groups, including the associated operating lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment.

Projected benefit payments are\ndiscounted to the measurement date using the corresponding rate from the yield curve that is consistent with the maturity profile of the expected\nliability cash flows.\nExpected Return on Plan Assets - The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is determined by using the plan’s target allocation and return\nexpectations based on many factors including forecasted long-term capital market real returns and the inflationary outlook on a plan by plan basis.

The Company believes COVID-19’s impact on its businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial\ncondition primarily will be driven by the geographies impacted and the severity and duration of the pandemic; the pandemic’s impact on the U.S. and global\neconomies and consumer behavior and health care utilization patterns; and the timing, scope and impact of legislation as well as other federal, state and local\ngovernmental responses to the pandemic. Those primary drivers are beyond the Company’s knowledge and control. As a result, the impact COVID-19 will\nhave on the Company’s businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition is uncertain, but the impact could be adverse and material. COVID-\n19 also may result in legal and regulatory proceedings, investigations and claims against the Company.\nGuarantees\nThe Company has the following significant guarantee arrangements at December 31, 2022:\n•\nASC Claim Funding Accounts - The Company has arrangements with certain banks for the processing of claim payments for its ASC customers. The\nbanks maintain accounts to fund claims of the Company’s ASC customers. The customer is responsible for funding the amount paid by the bank each day.\nIn these arrangements, the Company guarantees that the banks will not sustain losses if the responsible ASC customer does not properly fund its account.\nThe aggregate maximum exposure under these arrangements is generally limited to $250 million. The Company can limit its exposure to these guarantees\nby suspending the payment of claims for ASC customers that have not adequately funded the amount paid by the bank.\n•\nSeparate Accounts Assets - Certain Separate Accounts assets associated with the large case pensions business in the Corporate/Other segment represent\nfunds maintained as a contractual requirement to fund specific pension annuities that the Company has guaranteed. Minimum contractual obligations\nunderlying the guaranteed benefits in these Separate Accounts were approximately $941 million and $1.3 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively. See Note 1 ‘‘Significant Accounting Policies’’ for additional information on Separate Accounts. Contract holders assume all investment and\nmortality risk and are required to maintain Separate Accounts balances at or above a specified level. The level of required funds is a function of the risk\nunderlying the Separate Account’s investment strategy. If contract holders do not maintain the required level of Separate Accounts assets to meet the\nannuity guarantees, the Company would establish an additional lia",

As a result, the Company was not required to maintain any additional liability for its related guarantees at\nDecember 31, 2022.\nLease Guarantees\nBetween 1995 and 1997, the Company sold or spun off a number of subsidiaries, including Bob’s Stores and Linens ‘n Things, each of which subsequently\nfiled for bankruptcy, and Marshalls. In many cases, when a former subsidiary leased a store, the Company provided a guarantee of the former subsidiary’s lease\nobligations for the initial lease term and any extension thereof pursuant to a renewal option provided for in the lease prior to the time of the disposition. When\nthe subsidiaries were disposed of and accounted for as discontinued operations, the Company’s guarantees remained in place, although each initial purchaser\nagreed to indemnify the Company for any lease obligations the Company was required to satisfy. If any of the purchasers or any of the former subsidiaries fail\nto make the required payments under a store lease, the Company could be required to satisfy those obligations, and any significant adverse impact of COVID-\n19 on such purchasers and/or former subsidiaries increases the risk that the Company will be required to satisfy those obligations. As of December 31, 2022,\nthe Company guaranteed 67 such store leases (excluding the lease guarantees related to Linens ‘n Things, which have been recorded as a liability on the\nconsolidated balance sheets), with the maximum remaining lease term extending through 2034.\nGuaranty Fund Assessments, Market Stabilization and Other Non-Voluntary Risk Sharing Pools\nUnder guaranty fund laws existing in all states, insurers doing business in those states can be assessed (in most states up to prescribed limits) for certain\nobligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants. The life and health insurance guaranty associations in which the Company\nparticipates that operate under these laws respond to insolvencies of long-term care insurers and life insurers as well as health insurers. The Company’s\nassessments generally are based on a formula relating to the Company’s health care premiums in the state compared to the premiums of other insurers. Certain\nstates allow assessments to be recovered over time as offsets to premium taxes. Some states have similar laws relating to HMOs and/or other payors such as\nnot-for-profit consumer-governed health plans established under the ACA.\nIn 2009, the Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner placed long-term care insurer Penn Treaty Network America Insurance Company and one of its subsidiaries\n(collectively, “Penn Treaty”) in rehabilitation, an intermediate action before insolvency, and subsequently petitioned a state court to convert the rehabilitation\ninto a liquidation.

CMS uses various payment mechanisms to allocate and adjust premium payments to the Company’s and other\ncompanies’ Medicare plans by considering the applicable health status of Medicare members as supported by information prepared, maintained and provided\nby providers. The Company collects claim and encounter data from providers and generally relies on providers to appropriately code their submissions to the\nCompany and document their medical records, including the diagnosis data submitted to the Company with claims. CMS pays increased premiums to Medicare\nAdvantage plans and Medicare PDP plans for members who have certain medical conditions identified with specific diagnosis codes. Federal regulators review\nand audit the providers’ medical records to determine whether those records support the related diagnosis codes that determine the members’ health status and\nthe resulting risk-adjusted premium payments to the Company. In that regard, CMS has instituted risk adjustment data validation (“RADV”) audits of various\nMedicare Advantage plans, including certain of the Company’s plans, to validate coding practices and supporting medical record documentation maintained by\nproviders and the resulting risk-adjusted premium payments to the plans. CMS may require the Company to refund premium payments if the Company’s risk-\nadjusted premiums are not properly supported by medical record data. The Office of the Inspector General of the HHS (the “OIG”) also is auditing the\nCompany’s risk adjustment-related data and that of other companies.

Under the revised methodology, among other things, CMS announced extrapolation of the error rate identified in the audit sample along with the\napplication of a process to account for errors in the government’s traditional fee-for-service Medicare program (“FFS Adjuster”). For contract years prior to\n2011, CMS did not extrapolate sample error rates to the entire contract, nor did CMS propose to apply a FFS adjuster. By applying the FFS Adjuster, Medicare\nAdvantage organizations would have been liable for repayments only to the extent that their extrapolated payment errors exceeded the error rate in Original\nMedicare, which could have impacted the extrapolated repayments to which Medicare Advantage organizations are subject. This revised contract-level audit\nmethodology increased the Company’s exposure to premium refunds to CMS based on incomplete medical records maintained by providers. In the RADV\naudit methodology CMS used from 2011-2013, CMS selected only a few of the Company’s Medicare Advantage contracts for various contract years for\ncontract-level RADV audits. In October 2018, CMS in the proposed rule (“Proposed Rule”) announced a new methodology for RADV audits targeting certain\nhealth conditions and members with many diagnostic conditions along with extrapolation for the error rates identified without use of a FFS Adjuster.

The Company’s\nsegments maintain separate financial information, and the Company’s chief operating decision maker (the “CODM”) evaluates the segments’ operating results\non a regular basis in deciding how to allocate resources among the segments and in assessing segment performance. The CODM evaluates the performance of\nthe Company’s segments based on adjusted operating income, which is defined as operating income (GAAP measure) excluding the impact of amortization of\nintangible assets and other items, if any, that neither relate to the ordinary course of the Company’s business nor reflect the Company’s underlying business\nperformance. See the reconciliation of consolidated operating income (GAAP measure) to consolidated adjusted operating income below for further context\nregarding the items excluded from operating income in determining adjusted operating income. The Company uses adjusted operating income as its principal\nmeasure of segment performance as it enhances the Company’s ability to compare past financial performance with current performance and analyze underlying\nbusiness performance and trends. Non-GAAP financial measures the Company discloses, such as consolidated adjusted operating income, should not be\nconsidered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nIn 2022, 2021 and 2020, revenues from the federal government accounted for 18%, 17% and 16%, respectively, of the Company’s consolidated total\nrevenues, primarily related to contracts with CMS for coverage of Medicare-eligible individuals within the Health Care Benefits segment.\n176\n\n\nThe following is a reconciliation of financial measures of the Company’s segments to the consolidated totals:\nIn millions\nHealth Care\nBenefits\nPharmacy \nServices \nRetail/\nLTC\nCorporate/\nOther\nIntersegment\nEliminations \nConsolidated\nTotals\n2022:\nRevenues from external customers\n$\n90,844  $\n157,787  $\n72,874  $\n124 \n$\n— \n$\n321,629 \nIntersegment revenues\n89 \n11,449 \n33,764 \n— \n(45,302)\n— \nNet investment income (loss)\n476 \n— \n(44)\n406 \n— \n838 \nTotal revenues\n91,409 \n169,236 \n106,594 \n530 \n(45,302)\n322,467 \n  Adjusted operating income (loss)\n5,984 \n7,356 \n6,705 \n(1,785)\n(728)\n17,532 \nDepreciation and amortization\n1,629 \n567 \n1,813 \n238 \n— \n4,247 \n2021:\nRevenues from external customers\n81,515 \n143,194 \n66,078 \n125 \n— \n290,912 \nIntersegment revenues",

Although intangible assets contribute to the Company’s revenue generation, the amortization of intangible assets does not\ndirectly relate to the underwriting of the Company’s insurance products, the services performed for the Company’s customers or the sale of the Company’s products or services. Additionally,\nintangible asset amortization expense typically fluctuates based on the size and timing of the Company’s acquisition activity. Accordingly, the Company believes excluding the amortization of\nintangible assets enhances the Company’s and investors’ ability to compare the Company’s past financial performance with its current performance and to analyze underlying business\nperformance and trends. Intangible asset amortization excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure represents the entire amount recorded within the Company’s GAAP financial\nstatements, and the revenue generated by the associated intangible assets has not been excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure. Intangible asset amortization is excluded from the\nrelated non-GAAP financial measure because the amortization, unlike the related revenue, is not affected by operations of any particular period unless an intangible asset becomes impaired or\nthe estimated useful life of an intangible asset is revised.\n(2)\nIn 2022, the office real estate optimization charges primarily relate to the abandonment of leased real estate and the related right-of-use assets and property and equipment in connection with the\nplanned reduction of corporate office real estate space in response to the Company’s new flexible work arrangement.

During 2022, the loss on assets held for sale also relates to the Commercial Business reporting unit within the Health Care Benefits segment. In March\n2022, the Company reached an agreement to sell its Thailand business, which was included in the Commercial Business reporting unit. At that time, a portion of the Commercial Business\ngoodwill was specifically allocated to the Thailand business.

The Company’s\nsystem of internal control over financial reporting is enhanced by periodic reviews by the Company’s internal auditors, written policies and procedures and a\nwritten Code of Conduct adopted by CVS Health Corporation’s Board of Directors, applicable to all employees of the Company. In addition, the Company has\nan internal Disclosure Committee, comprised of management from each functional area within the Company, which performs a separate review of disclosure\ncontrols and procedures. There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system of internal control over financial reporting.\nBased on management’s assessment, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective and provides reasonable\nassurance that assets are safeguarded and that the financial records are reliable for preparing financial statements as of December 31, 2022.\nErnst & Young LLP, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, is appointed by CVS Health Corporation’s Board of Directors and ratified\nby CVS Health Corporation’s stockholders. They were engaged to render an opinion regarding the fair presentation of the Company’s consolidated financial\nstatements as well as conducting an audit of internal control over financial reporting. Their reports included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K are based upon audits\nconducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).\nChanges in internal control over financial reporting\nThere has been no change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of\nRule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 that occurred during the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2022 that has materially affected, or is reas",

Except as otherwise required by law, or by the provisions of the preferred stock or the preference stock, or provided in any resolution adopted by the\nCVS Health board of directors (the “board”) with respect to any subsequently created class or series of shares of CVS Health, the holders of the shares of\ncommon stock exclusively possess all voting power. The Charter precludes cumulative voting in the election of directors. The Charter provides for a majority\nvote standard for uncontested elections of directors, and a plurality of votes standard for contested elections of directors. Subject to any rights of any\noutstanding series of preferred stock or preference stock, (i) the holders of shares of common stock are entitled to such dividends as may be declared from time\nto time by the board from funds available therefor, (ii) no dividends may be declared, paid, or set aside for payment on shares of common stock unless full\ncumulative dividends are paid on any outstanding preference stock and any other preferred stock issued and outstanding at such time that is designated to have\nsuch dividend preference and (iii) upon dissolution the holders of shares of common stock are entitled to receive pro rata all assets of CVS Health available for\ndistribution to such holders, subject to any liquidation preferences designated to any preferred stock or preference stock that may be issued and outstanding at\nsuch time of liquidation.\nNo Preemptive Rights\nThe Charter provides that no holder of any shares of CVS Health of any class or series may have any preemptive right to purchase or subscribe to any\nshares of CVS Health or any security convertible into shares of CVS Health of any class or series.\nProvisions Relating to Amendments to CVS Health’s Charter and By-Laws\nUnder Delaware law, stockholders have the right to adopt, amend or repeal the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of a corporation. However,\nDelaware law requires that any amendment to the Charter also be approved by the board. Under Delaware law, unless a higher vote is required in a\ncorporation’s certificate of incorporation, amendments to the corporation’s certificate of incorporation will be adopted upon receiving at a properly convened\nmeeting the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by all stockholders entitled to vote thereon, and if any class or series is entitled to vote thereon as a\nclass, the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast in each class vote.\nIn addition, the By-Laws may be amended by the board with respect to all matters not exclusively",

However, it mentions 'unrealized capital losses' and 'amortized cost basis', which suggest that the depreciation of the debt securities is related to interest rate increases rather than unfavorable changes in credit quality.\nChunk 209: The amortized cost basis of the Company's mortgage loans within each credit quality indicator by year of origination was as follows: 2022 - Total: $1,044 million, 2021 - Total: $902 million.\nChunk 215: None\nChunk 216: $1.8 billion, $2.3 billion, and $2.3 billion were the amortization expenses for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nChunk 217: The net property and equipment for finance leases is $1,324 million in 2022 and $1,187 million in 2021.\nChunk 219: The Company recorded $44 million related to property and equipment as part of office real estate optimization charges.\nChunk 220: The impairment charge consisted of a write-down of approximately $1.1 billion related to operating lease right-of-use assets and $261 million related to property and equipment, within the Retail/LTC segment.\nChunk 224: The write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs was $8 million in December 2021, $26 million in August 2021, and $45 million in December 2020.\nChunk 226: Amortization of net actuarial loss, which is $3 million in 2022, $5 million in 2021, and $2 million in 2020.\nChunk 230: The deferred income tax liabilities related to depreciation and amortization were $7,139 million and $8,381 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nChunk 253: The depreciation and amortization figures for 2022 are: $1,629M for Health Care Benefits, $567M for Pharmacy Services, $1,813M for Retail/LTC, $238M for Corporate/Other, and $4,247M in total.\nChunk 254: The depreciation and amortization figures for the years 2022 and 2020 are $4,512 million and $4,441 million, respectively. The depreciation and amortization figures for the years 2022 and 2020 are $1,837 million, $576 million, $1,884 million, and $215 million, respectively.\nChunk 255: The amortization of intangible assets is excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure because it is not affected by operations of any particular period unless an intangible asset becomes impaired or the estimated useful life of an intangible asset is revised.\n\nDepreciation Information:\nChunk 0: None\nChunk 3: None\nChunk 5: None\nChunk 7: None\nChunk 8: None\nChunk 10: None\nChunk 12: None\nChunk 14: None\nChunk 15: None\nChunk 19: None\nChunk 20: None\nChunk 22: None\nChunk 23: None\nChunk 29: None\nChunk 30: None\nChunk 46: None\nChunk 47: The total asset base is not explicitly mentioned.

However, we can infer that the total assets are not disclosed, but we can find the total liabilities and equity, which can be used to calculate the total assets if the liabilities and equity are known. The fixed assets are not explicitly stated either.\nChunk 169: The total assets for 2022 and 2021 are $228,275 million and $232,999 million respectively. The fixed assets include Property and equipment, net ($12,873 million and $12,896 million), Operating lease right-of-use assets ($17,872 million and $19,122 million), Goodwill ($78,150 million and $79,121 million), Intangible assets, net ($24,754 million and $29,026 million).\nChunk 170: Total assets: $228,275 (2022) and $232,999 (2021). However, the fixed assets are not explicitly mentioned in the provided excerpt. The closest information related to fixed assets is the 'Purchases of property and equipment' under the 'Cash flows from investing activities' section, which are $2,727 (2022), $2,520 (2021), and $2,437 (2020).\nChunk 171: None\nChunk 172: The total assets are $71,315.\nChunk 174: None\nChunk 175: Unfortunately, the provided document excerpt does not explicitly mention total assets or fixed assets.

The total property and equipment, net, is $13,117 million, and the reinsurance recoverables are recorded as other current assets or other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Therefore, the total assets would be at least $13,117 million plus the reinsurance recoverables.\nChunk 181: The total property and equipment under finance or capital leases was $2.4 billion, $2.3 billion, and $2.1 billion for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nChunk 182: None\nChunk 183: Unfortunately, the provided excerpt does not contain a summary of total assets or fixed assets. However, it does mention specific asset-related information such as office real estate optimization charges ($117 million), store impairment charge ($1.4 billion), and goodwill impairment charge ($431 million).\nChunk 184: The document excerpt does not provide information about total assets or fixed assets. However, it mentions that 'These assets and liabilities are carried at fair value.' This suggests that the asset base is valued at fair value, but does not provide a specific amount.\nChunk 188: None\nChunk 189: The total asset base is not explicitly stated, but it can be inferred that the Company had approximately $2.9 billion in assets related to Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) at December 31, 2021. However, the Company did not hold any HSA funds as of December 31, 2022. There is no information about fixed assets in the provided document excerpt.\nChunk 190: None\nChunk 191: None\nChunk 194: None\nChunk 195: None\nChunk 196: None\nChunk 197: None\nChunk 199: None\nChunk 200: None\nChunk 201: The total asset base is $1,537 million as of December 31, 2022, and $1,289 million as of December 31, 2021.

The fixed assets included in this total are property and equipment, net, which were $244 million.\nChunk 205: The total investments at December 31, 2022 were $23,891 million.\nChunk 206: Unfortunately, the provided text does not explicitly mention the total assets or fixed assets. However, we can infer that the total assets include the debt securities, investments, and other assets mentioned in the document. The total debt securities at December 31, 2022, were $20,280 million. The investments related to the 2012 conversion of an existing group annuity contract were $331 million at December 31, 2022.

There is no information about fixed assets in the provided excerpt.\nChunk 215: Total assets: $5,017 million (2022), $5,017 million (2021). Fixed assets are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text.\nChunk 216: The total intangible assets as of December 31, 2022, are $37,859 million, and as of December 31, 2021, are $41,753 million.

However, we can extract the following information about fixed assets: Property and equipment, gross is $1,608 million as of December 31, 2022, and $1,375 million as of December 31, 2021.\nChunk 218: None\nChunk 219: None\nChunk 220: None\nChunk 221: None\nChunk 222: Total debt principal: $52,753 million as of December 31, 2022. However, this is not a direct measure of the asset base. Unfortunately, the total assets and fixed assets are not explicitly mentioned in the provided excerpt.\nChunk 223: None\nChunk 224: None\nChunk 225: The total assets are $6,677 million as of the beginning of 2022 and $5,346 million as of the end of 2022. There is no information about fixed assets.\nChunk 226: The total assets recognized on the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2022 and 2021 for the defined benefit pension plans were $827 million and $946 million, respectively. However, the document excerpt does not provide information about fixed assets. It only mentions noncurrent assets, which were $827 million in 2022 and $946 million in 2021.\nChunk 227: The total pension plan assets are $4,299 million.\nChunk 228: $5,781\nChunk 229: The total asset allocation is 100% (77% in fixed income and debt securities, 5% in real estate, 3% in private equity limited partnerships and 3% in hedge funds). However, the total asset value is not explicitly stated. The Company contributed $27 million, $78 million and $25 million to its pension plans during 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, but this is not the total asset value. The Company's contributions to multiemployer pension plans were $20 million, $19 million and $19 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nChunk 230: None\nChunk 231: Unfortunately, the provided text does not contain information about the total assets or fixed assets.

      "output": "Based on the collected outputs, we have gathered the following information:\n\n1. **Capital Expenditures**: The total capital expenditures for CVS Health in 2022 were approximately $2.7 billion, with a breakdown of 73% for technology, digital, and other strategic initiatives, and 27% for store, fulfillment, and support facilities expansion and improvements.\n\n2. **Depreciation and Amortization**: The total depreciation and amortization expenses for 2022 were $4,247 million. This includes expenses across different segments such as Health Care Benefits, Pharmacy Services, and Retail/LTC.\n\n3. **Asset Base**: The total assets for CVS Health as of December 31, 2022, were $228,275 million. The fixed assets include property and equipment, net ($12,873 million), operating lease right-of-use assets ($17,872 million), goodwill ($78,150 million), and intangible assets, net ($24,754 million).\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Sufficiency of Information**: The information gathered is sufficient to assess whether CVS Health is a capital-intensive business. We have data on capital expenditures, depreciation and amortization, and the asset base, which are key indicators of capital intensity.\n\n- **Capital Intensity Assessment**: A business is considered capital-intensive if it requires significant capital investment in fixed assets to generate revenue. CVS Health's capital expenditures of $2.7 billion and significant depreciation and amortization expenses of $4,247 million suggest substantial investment in maintaining and expanding its asset base. The large total asset base of $228,275 million, with significant portions in fixed assets, further supports this.\n\n- **Conclusion**: Based on the FY2022 data, CVS Health can be considered a capital-intensive business. The substantial capital expenditures and large asset base indicate that significant capital is required to sustain and grow its operations.\n\nThere are no conflicting answers in the gathered information, and the data is consistent with the characteristics of a capital-intensive business."
