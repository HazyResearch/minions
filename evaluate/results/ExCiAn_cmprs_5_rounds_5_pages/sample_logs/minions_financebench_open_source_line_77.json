    "Yes, CVS Health requires an extensive asset base to operate, which is evident from its ROA of only 1.82% in 2022 and 3.39% in 2021, though it should be noted that a significant portion of this asset base is goodwill, and CVS's fixed assets/total assets ratio is on the lower side of 5.6%."

  "correctness_reasoning": "The predicted answer states that CVS Health is not a capital-intensive business, which directly contradicts the ground truth answer. The ground truth indicates that CVS Health is capital-intensive, as evidenced by its low ROA and the need for an extensive asset base. The evaluation rules require the stance on yes/no questions to match exactly, which is not the case here."
