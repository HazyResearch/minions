--- Question ---
What is Lockheed Martin's 2 year total revenue CAGR from FY2020 to FY2022 (in units of percents and round to one decimal place)? Provide a response to the question by primarily using the statement of income.

--- Predicted Answer ---
CAGR = ((65,984 / 65,398)^(1/2) - 1) * 100 = 0.4%

--- Ground Truth ---
['0.4%']

--- Correctness Evaluation ---
Is correct: True
Confidence: 1.00
Reasoning: The predicted answer correctly calculates the CAGR using the formula: CAGR = ((Final Value / Initial Value)^(1/Number of Years) - 1) * 100. The values used (65,984 and 65,398) match the context of the question, and the calculated CAGR of 0.4% matches the ground truth answer. The calculation is accurate and within the allowed tolerance.
