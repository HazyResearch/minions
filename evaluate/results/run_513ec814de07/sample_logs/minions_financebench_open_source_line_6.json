  "question": "Does 3M have a reasonably healthy liquidity profile based on its quick ratio for Q2 of FY2023? If the quick ratio is not relevant to measure liquidity, please state that and explain why.",
  "predicted_answer": "Based on the calculated quick ratio of 0.88, 3M does not have a reasonably healthy liquidity profile for Q2 of FY2023. This suggests that the company may struggle to meet its short-term obligations without selling inventory or securing additional financing.",
  "ground_truth": [
    "No. The quick ratio for 3M was 0.96 by Jun'23 close, which needs a bit of an improvement to touch the 1x mark"
