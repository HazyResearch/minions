--- Question ---
Does Verizon have a reasonably healthy liquidity profile based on its quick ratio for FY 2022? If the quick ratio is not relevant to measure liquidity, please state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
Verizon has a reasonably healthy liquidity profile based on its quick ratio for FY 2022.

--- Ground Truth ---
['No. The quick ratio was approximately 0.54 for Verizon. It indicated that Verizon does not have a healthy liquidity profile.']

--- Correctness Evaluation ---
Is correct: False
Confidence: 1.00
Reasoning: The predicted answer states that Verizon has a reasonably healthy liquidity profile based on its quick ratio for FY 2022, which contradicts the ground truth answer. The ground truth indicates that a quick ratio of approximately 0.54 suggests an unhealthy liquidity profile. The stance on the liquidity profile does not match, violating the evaluation rule for yes/no questions.
