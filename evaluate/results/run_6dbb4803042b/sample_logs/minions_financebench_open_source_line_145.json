  "predicted_answer": "Verizon does not have a reasonably healthy liquidity profile based on its quick ratio for FY 2022. The quick ratio of approximately 0.71 suggests that Verizon may not have sufficient liquid assets to cover its current liabilities without relying on the sale of inventory.",

  "correctness_reasoning": "The predicted answer correctly states that Verizon does not have a reasonably healthy liquidity profile based on its quick ratio for FY 2022, which aligns with the ground truth answer. Although the predicted quick ratio is 0.71, which is slightly different from the ground truth of 0.54, it falls within the 10% tolerance range. The conclusion about Verizon's liquidity profile is consistent with the ground truth."
