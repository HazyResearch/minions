--- Question ---
We need to calculate a reasonable approximation (or exact number if possible) of a financial metric. Basing your judgment by information plainly provided in the balance sheet and the P&L statement, what is Lockheed Martin's FY2020 asset turnover ratio? Asset turnover ratio is defined as: FY2020 revenue / (average total assets between FY2019 and FY2020). Round your answer to two decimal places.

--- Predicted Answer ---
1.33

--- Ground Truth ---
['1.33']

--- Correctness Evaluation ---
Is correct: True
Confidence: 1.00
Reasoning: The predicted answer of 1.33 matches the ground truth answer exactly. Given the evaluation rule for numerical answers, the predicted answer falls within the 10% tolerance range, which in this case is not needed as it is an exact match. Therefore, the predicted answer is correct.
