  "correctness_reasoning": "The predicted answer correctly states that 3M does not have a reasonably healthy liquidity profile for Q2 of FY2023 because its quick ratio is below 1.0. This aligns with the ground truth answer, which also indicates that the quick ratio is 0.96 and needs improvement to reach 1.0. The stance and key facts match exactly."
