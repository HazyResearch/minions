Total length: 377136 characters to answer this question. \n\nAlso consider the following constraints:\n- In your response do NOT use numbered lists.\n- Do NOT structure your response as a sequence of steps.\n",
      "output": "To determine which activity brought in the most or lost the least cash flow for Nike in FY2023, focus on the cash flow statement within the financial document. This section will detail cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities. Look for the net cash provided by or used in each of these activities. Pay attention to the figures that indicate the net cash flow for each category, as these will reveal which activity had the highest positive impact or the smallest negative impact on cash flow. Additionally, consider any notes or explanations accompanying these figures that might provide context or insights into significant changes or one-time events affecting cash flow."

Instead, you can assign small, isolated tasks to a less capable worker model that sees only a single chunk of text at a time. Any cross-chunk or multi-document reasoning must be handled by you.\n\n## Your Job: Write Two Python Functions\n\n### FUNCTION #1: `prepare_jobs(context, prev_job_manifests, prev_job_outputs) -> List[JobManifest]`\n- Break the document(s) into chunks (using the provided chunking function, if needed). Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 12 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`. All **multi-chunk integration** or **global reasoning** is your responsibility here.\n- Return one **aggregated string** suitable for further supervisor inspection.\n\n\n\n## Relevant Pydantic Models\n\nThe following models are already in the global scope. **Do NOT redefine or re-import them.**\n\n### JobManifest Model\n```\nclass JobManifest(BaseModel):\n    chunk: str  # the actual text for the chunk of the document\n    task: str  # the actual task instruction for the small model\n    advice: str  # optional, any additional advice on how to perform the task\n\n    chunk_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    task_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    job_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n\n```\n\n### JobOutput Model\n```\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    citation: Optional[str]\n    answer: Optional[str]\n\n```\n\n## Function Signatures\n```\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        context (List[str]): A list of documents.

NIKE is the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. We sell our products \nthrough NIKE Direct operations, which are comprised of both NIKE-owned retail stores and sales through our digital platforms \n(also referred to as \"NIKE Brand Digital\"), to retail accounts and to a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales \nrepresentatives in nearly all countries around the world. We also offer interactive consumer services and experiences through our \ndigital platforms. Nearly all of our products are manufactured by independent contractors. Nearly all footwear and apparel \nproducts are manufactured outside the United States, while equipment products are manufactured both in the United States and \nabroad.\nAll references to fiscal 2023, 2022, 2021 and 2020 are to NIKE, Inc.'s fiscal years ended May 31, 2023, 2022, 2021 and 2020, \nrespectively.

We also \ndesign products specifically for the Jordan Brand and Converse. We believe this approach allows us to create products that \nbetter meet individual consumer needs while accelerating our largest growth opportunities.\nNIKE's athletic footwear products are designed primarily for specific athletic use, although a large percentage of the products are \nworn for casual or leisure purposes. We place considerable emphasis on innovation and high-quality construction in the \ndevelopment and manufacturing of our products. Our Men's, Women's and Jordan Brand footwear products currently lead in \nfootwear sales and we expect them to continue to do so.\nWe also sell sports apparel, which features the same trademarks and are sold predominantly through the same marketing and \ndistribution channels as athletic footwear. Our sports apparel, similar to our athletic footwear products, is designed primarily for \nathletic use, although many of the products are worn for casual or leisure purposes, and demonstrates our commitment to \ninnovation and high-quality construction. Our Men's and Women's apparel products currently lead in apparel sales and we expect \nthem to continue to do so. We often market footwear, apparel and accessories in \"collections\" of similar use or by category. We \nalso market apparel with licensed college and professional team and league logos.\nWe sell a line of performance equipment and accessories under the NIKE Brand name, including bags, socks, sport balls, \neyewear",

Operating results of the Converse brand are reported on a stand-alone basis.\nIn addition to the products we sell to our wholesale customers and directly to consumers through our NIKE Direct operations, we \nhave also entered into license agreements that permit unaffiliated parties to manufacture and sell, using NIKE-owned trademarks, \ncertain apparel, digital devices and applications and other equipment designed for sports activities.\n2023 FORM 10-K   1    \n\n\nWe also offer interactive consumer services and experiences as well as digital products through our digital platforms, including \nfitness and activity apps; sport, fitness and wellness content; and digital services and features in retail stores that enhance the \nconsumer experience.\nSALES AND MARKETING\nWe experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year. Historically, revenues in the first and fourth \nfiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third fiscal quarters. However, the mix of product sales may vary \nconsiderably as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear, apparel and equipment, \nas well as other macroeconomic, strategic, operating and logistics-related factors.\nBecause NIKE is a consumer products company, the relative popularity and availability of various sports and fitness activities, as \nwell as changing design trends, affect the demand for our products. We must, therefore, respond to trends and shifts in consumer \npreferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings, developing new products, styles and categories and influencing \nsports and fitness preferences through extensive marketing. Failure to respond in a timely and adequate manner could have a \nmaterial adverse effect on our sales and profitability. This is a continuing risk. Refer to Item 1A.

For example, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and \nDevelopment (OECD) and the G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (the \"Inclusive Framework\") has put \nforth two proposals—Pillar One and Pillar Two—that revise the existing profit allocation and nexus rules and ensure a minimal \nlevel of taxation, respectively. On December 12, 2022, the European Union member states agreed to implement the Inclusive \nFramework's global corporate minimum tax rate of 15%. Other countries are also actively considering changes to their tax laws to \nadopt certain parts of the Inclusive Framework's proposals.

We also utilize tax rulings and other \nagreements to obtain certainty in treatment of certain tax matters. Tax holidays and rulings can expire from time to time and may \nbe extended when certain conditions are met, or terminated if certain conditions are not met. The impact of any changes in \nconditions would be the loss of certainty in treatment thus potentially impacting our effective income tax rate. For example, in \nJanuary 2019, the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether the Netherlands has breached State \nAid rules when granting certain tax rulings to the Company. If this matter is adversely resolved, the Netherlands may be required \nto assess additional amounts with respect to prior periods, and the Company's income taxes related to prior periods in the \nNetherlands could increase.\nWe are also subject to the examination of our tax returns by the United States Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") and other tax \nauthorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the \nadequacy of our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our tax provisions are adequate, the final determination of tax \naudits and any related disputes could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of \naudits or related disputes could have an adverse effect on our financial statements for the period or periods for which the \napplicable final determinations are made. For example, we and our subsidiaries are also engaged in a number of intercompany \ntransactions across multiple tax jurisdictions.

Management \nuses these non-GAAP measures when evaluating the Company's performance, including when making financial and operating \ndecisions.

NIKE Brand wholesale equivalent revenues consist \nof (1) sales to external wholesale customers and (2) internal sales from our wholesale operations to our NIKE Direct operations, \nwhich are charged at prices comparable to those charged to external wholesale customers. \nCOMPARABLE STORE SALES\nComparable store sales: This key metric, which excludes NIKE Brand Digital sales, comprises revenues from NIKE-owned in-\nline and factory stores for which all three of the following requirements have been met: (1) the store has been open at least one \nyear, (2) square footage has not changed by more than 15% within the past year and (3) the store has not been permanently \nrepositioned within the past year. Comparable store sales includes revenues from stores that were temporarily closed during the \nperiod as a result of COVID-19. Comparable store sales represents a performance metric that we believe is useful information for \nmanagement and investors in understanding the performance of our established NIKE-owned in-line and factory stores. \nManagement considers this metric when making financial and operating decisions. The method of calculating comparable store \nsales varies across the retail industry.

Revenues were $51.2 billion in fiscal 2023, which increased 10% and 16% compared to fiscal 2022 on a reported \nand currency-neutral basis, respectively. The increase was due to higher revenues in North America, Europe, Middle East & \nAfrica (\"EMEA\"), APLA and Greater China, which contributed approximately 7, 6, 2 and 1 percentage points to NIKE, Inc. \nRevenues, respectively. \n• NIKE Brand revenues, which represented over 90% of NIKE, Inc. Revenues, increased 10% and 16% on a reported and \ncurrency-neutral basis, respectively. This increase was primarily due to higher revenues in Men's, the Jordan Brand, \nWomen's and Kids' which grew 17%, 35%,11% and 10%, respectively, on a wholesale equivalent basis. \n• NIKE Brand footwear revenues increased 20% on a currency-neutral basis, due to higher revenues in Men's, the \nJordan Brand, Women's and Kids'. Unit sales of footwear increased 13%, while higher average selling price (\"ASP\") \nper pair contributed approximately 7 percentage points of footwear revenue growth. Higher ASP was primarily due to \nhigher full-price ASP, net of discounts, on a wholesale equivalent basis, and growth in the size of our NIKE Direct \nbusiness, partially offset by lower NIKE Direct ASP. \n• NIKE Brand apparel revenues increased 8% on a currency-neutral basis, primarily due to higher revenues in Men's. \nUnit sales of apparel increased 4%, while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 4 percentage points of \napparel revenue growth. Higher ASP was primarily due to higher full-price ASP and growth in the size of our NIKE \nDirect business, partially offset by lower NIKE Direct ASP, reflecting higher promotional activity.\n• NIKE Direct revenues increased 14% from $18.7 billion in fiscal 2022 to $21.3 billion in fiscal 2023. On a currency-neutral \nbasis, NIKE Direct revenues increased 20% primarily driven by NIKE Brand Digital sales growth of 24%, comparable store \nsales growth of 14% and the addition of ne",

Our primary foreign currency exposures arise from the recording of \ntransactions denominated in non-functional currencies and the translation of foreign currency denominated results of operations, \nfinancial position and cash flows into U.S. Dollars.\nOur foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency \nfluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We manage global foreign exchange risk \ncentrally on a portfolio basis to address those risks material to NIKE, Inc. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of \nnatural offsets and currency correlations existing within the portfolio and, where practical and material, by hedging a portion of the \nremaining exposures using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options.

Where exposures are hedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate \nmovements on our Consolidated Financial Statements; the length of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizons.

Our most significant \ntransactional foreign currency exposures are:\n• Product Costs — NIKE's product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways:\n1.\nProduct purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity:\na.\nCertain NIKE entities purchase product from the NTC, a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded \nproducts from third-party factories, predominantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the \nU.S. Dollar, then sells the products to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies. NTC sales to a NIKE \nentity with a different functional currency results in a foreign currency exposure for the NTC.\nb.\nOther NIKE entities purchase product directly from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate \na foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar.\nIn both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U.S. Dollar reduces inventory costs incurred by NIKE whereas a stronger \nU.S. Dollar increases its cost.\n2.\nFactory input costs: NIKE operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is \ndesigned to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories' foreign currency \nexposures, some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our \npayments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies (\"factory currency exposure \nindex\") in which the labor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded \nproducts (\"factory input costs\") are denominated.\nAs an offset to the impacts of the fluctuating U.S. Dollar on our non-functional currency denominated product purchases \ndescribed above, a strengthening U.S. Dollar against the",

These sales generate a foreign currency exposure.\n• Other Costs — Non-functional currency denominated costs, such as endorsement contracts, also generate foreign currency \nrisk, though to a lesser extent. \n• Non-Functional Currency Denominated Monetary Assets and Liabilities — Our global subsidiaries have various assets and \nliabilities, primarily receivables and payables, including intercompany receivables and payables, denominated in currencies \nother than their functional currencies. These balance sheet items are subject to remeasurement which may create \nfluctuations in Other (income) expense, net within our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nMANAGING TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES\nTransactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program. We manage \nthese exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect \nto use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted \nfuture cash flows, including certain product cost exposures, non-functional currency denominated external sales and other costs \ndescribed above. Generally, these are accounted for as cash flow hedges.\n2023 FORM 10-K   43    \n\n\nCertain currency forward contracts used to manage the foreign exchange exposure of non-functional currency denominated \nmonetary assets and liabilities subject to remeasurement are not formally designated as hedging instruments. Accordingly, \nchanges in fair value of these instruments are recognized in Other (income) expense, net and are intended to offset the foreign \ncurrency impact of the remeasurement of the related non-functional currency denominated asset or liability being hedged. \nTRANSLATIONAL EXPOSURES\nMany of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar.

If we estimate the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on \nour books, we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value. \nThis reserve is recorded as a charge to Cost of sales.

When the specific criteria to qualify for hedge accounting has been met, \nchanges in the fair value of contracts hedging probable forecasted future cash flows are recorded in Accumulated other \ncomprehensive income (loss), rather than Net income, until the underlying hedged transaction affects Net income. In most cases, \nthis results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into \nNet income sometime after the maturity of the derivative. One of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the notional \nvalue of these derivative contracts should not be in excess of the designated amount of anticipated transactions.

The determination of our \nprovision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex \ntax laws. On an interim basis, we estimate our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year. This estimated annual effective tax rate is \nthen applied to the year-to-date Income before income taxes excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items, to determine the \nyear-to-date Income tax expense. The income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in \nwhich they occur. As the fiscal year progresses, we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by \njurisdiction during the year. This continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for \nthe fiscal year. When this occurs, we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs.\nOn a quarterly basis, we evaluate the probability a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the \namount recognized for uncertain tax positions based on factors including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, \nsettled audit issues and new audit activity. Changes in our assessment may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an \nadditional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment changes. We recognize interest and penalties related to \nincome tax matters in Income tax expense. \nRefer to Note 7 — Income Taxes in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nOTHER CONTINGENCIES\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are subject to various legal proceedings, claims and government investigations related to \nour business, products and actions of our employees and representatives, including contractual and employment relationships, \nproduct liability, antitrust, customs, tax, intellectual property and other matters.

Assessing \nprobability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, including in some cases judgments about \nthe potential actions of third-party claimants and courts. Recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information \navailable and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain. If future adjustments to estimated probable future losses \nor actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims, we would record additional charges during the period in which the \nactual loss or change in estimate occurred.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES \nABOUT MARKET RISK\nIn the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures, we employ a variety of financial \ninstruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates. It is our policy to utilize these \nfinancial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures; we do not enter into these \ntransactions for trading or speculative purposes.\nWe are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations, primarily as a result of our international sales, product sourcing and funding \nactivities. Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of \ncurrency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We use forward and option \ncontracts to hedge certain anticipated, but not yet firmly committed, transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the \nrelated receivables and payables, including third-party and intercompany transactions. Where exposures are hedged, our \nprogram has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe timing for hedging exposures, as well as the type and duration of the hedge instruments employed, are guided by our \nhedging policies and determined based upon the nature of the exposure and prevailing market conditions. Typically, the \nCompany may enter into hedge contracts starting 12 to 24 months in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place \nincremental hedges up to 100% of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs. The majority of derivatives \noutstanding as of May 31, 2023, are designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges, primarily for Euro/U.S. Dollar, British \nPound/Euro, Chinese Yuan/U.S. Dollar, and Japanese Yen/U.S. Dollar currency pairs. Refer to Note 12 — Risk Management and \nDerivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nOur earnings are also exposed to movements in short- and long-term market interest rates. Our objective in managing this \ninterest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing \ncosts. To achieve these objectives, we maintain a mix of commercial paper, bank loans, and fixed-rate debt of varying maturities.\nMARKET RISK MEASUREMENT\nWe monitor foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of \nmarket value, sensitivity analysis and Value-at-Risk (\"VaR\"). Our market-sensitive derivative and other financial instruments are \nforeign currency forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts, intercompany loans denominated i",

The VaR determines the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate-\nsensitive financial instruments. The VaR model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. There \nare various modeling techniques that can be used in the VaR computation. Our computations are based on interrelationships \nbetween currencies and interest rates (a \"variance/co-variance\" technique). These interrelationships are a function of foreign \nexchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one-year period. The value of foreign currency \noptions does not change on a one-to-one basis with changes in the underlying currency rate. We adjust the potential loss in \noption value for the estimated sensitivity (the \"delta\" and \"gamma\") to changes in the underlying currency rate. This calculation \nreflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only and does not include the impact of such \nrate fluctuations on non-functional currency transactions (such as anticipated transactions, firm commitments, cash balances and \naccounts and loans receivable and payable), including those which are hedged by these instruments.\nThe VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value we will incur nor does it \nconsider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates. It also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss \nthat may occur. Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates \nand interrelationships, hedging instruments and hedge percentages, timing and other factors.\nThe estimated maximum one-day loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments, derived \nusing the VaR model, was $111 million and $99 million as of May 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The VaR increased year-over-\nyear as a result of an increase in foreign currency volatilities as of May 31, 2023. Such a hypothetical loss in the fair value of our \nderivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged. The average monthly change \nin the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was $289 million and $170 million \nduring fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively.\nThe instruments not included in the VaR are intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies and fixed interest rate \nU.S. Dollar denominated debt.

Operating results of the Converse brand are reported on a \nstand-alone basis.\nBASIS OF CONSOLIDATION\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of NIKE, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the \"Company\" or \"NIKE\"). All \nsignificant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. \nREVENUE RECOGNITION\nRevenue transactions associated with the sale of NIKE Brand footwear, apparel and equipment, as well as Converse products, \ncomprise a single performance obligation, which consists of the sale of products to customers either through wholesale or direct \nto consumer channels. The Company satisfies the performance obligation and records revenues when transfer of control to the \ncustomer has occurred, based on the terms of sale. A customer is considered to have control once they are able to direct the use \nand receive substantially all of the benefits of the product. \nControl is transferred to wholesale customers upon shipment or upon receipt depending on the country of the sale and the \nagreement with the customer. Control transfers to retail store customers at the time of sale and to substantially all digital \ncommerce customers upon shipment. The transaction price is determined based upon the invoiced sales price, less anticipated \nsales returns, discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers. Payment terms for wholesale transactions depend on the \ncountry of sale or agreement with the customer and payment is generally required within 90 days or less of shipment to or receipt \nby the wholesale customer. Payment is due at the time of sale for retail store and digital commerce transactions.\nConsideration for trademark licensing contracts is earned through sales-based or usage-based royalty arrangements, and the \nassociated revenues are recognized over the license period. \nTaxes assessed by governmental authorities that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing \ntransaction, and are collected by the Company from a customer, are excluded from Revenues and Cost of sales in the \nConsolidated Statements of Income. Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product \nhas transferred to a customer are accounted for as fulfillment costs and are included in Cost of sales when the related revenues \nare recognized.\nSALES-RELATED RESERVES\nConsideration promised in the Company's contracts with customers is variable due to anticipated reductions, such as sales \nreturns, discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers.

In these instances, to the extent actual payments to the endorser differ from the \nCompany's estimate due to changes in the endorser's performance, adjustments to Demand creation expense may be recorded \nin a future period.\nCertain contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percent of sales of particular products, \nwhich the Company records in Cost of sales as the related sales occur.

If such facts indicate a potential impairment, the Company would assess the \nrecoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected \nundiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life \nof the primary asset in the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not \nrecoverable, the Company will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies, which would \ntypically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset \ngroup's carrying amount and its estimated fair value.\nGOODWILL AND INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nThe Company performs annual impairment tests on goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of \neach fiscal year or when events occur or circumstances change that would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a \nreporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life below its carrying value. \nFor purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, the Company allocates goodwill across its reporting units, which are considered \nthe Company's operating segments.

If, after assessing the \ntotality of events and circumstances, the Company determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or \nindefinite-lived intangible asset is greater than its carrying amount, an impairment test is unnecessary. \nIf an impairment test is necessary, the Company will estimate the fair value of the related reporting unit or indefinite-lived \nintangible asset. If the carrying value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, the goodwill of \nthat reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is determined to be impaired and the Company will record an impairment \ncharge equal to the excess of the carrying value over the related fair value. \nThere were no accumulated impairment losses as of May 31, 2023 and 2022. Additionally, the impact to Goodwill as a result of \nacquisitions and divestitures during fiscal 2023 and 2022, was not material.\nOPERATING LEASES\nThe Company primarily leases retail store space, certain distribution and warehouse facilities, office space, equipment and other \nnon-real estate assets. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception and begins recording lease activity at \nthe commencement date, which is generally the date in which the Company takes possession of or controls the physical use of \nthe asset. Lease components are not separated from non-lease components for real estate leases within the Company's lease \nportfolio. Right-of-use (\"ROU\") assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the \nlease term with lease expense recognized on a straight-line basis. The Company's incremental borrowing rate is used to \ndetermine the present value of future lease payments unless the implicit rate is readily determinable. \nLease agreements may contain rent escalation clauses, renewal or termination options, rent holidays or certain landlord \nincentives, including tenant improvement allowances. ROU assets include amounts for scheduled rent increases and are reduced \nby the amount of lease incentives. The lease term includes the non-cancelable period of the lease and options to extend or \nterminate the lease when it is reasonably certain the Company will exercise those options. The Company does not record leases \nwith an initial term of 12 months or less on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and recognizes related lease payments in the \nConsolidated Statements of Income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Certain lease agreements include variable lease \npayments, which are based on a percent of retail sales over specified levels or adjust periodically for inflation as a result of \nchanges in a published index, primaril",

Fair value is the price the Company would receive to sell an asset or pay to \ntransfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date. The Company uses a three-level \nhierarchy that prioritizes fair value measurements based on the types of inputs used, as follows:\nNIKE, INC.      \n64\n\n\n• Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n• Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; these include \nquoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in \nmarkets that are not active.\n• Level 3: Unobservable inputs with little or no market data available, which require the reporting entity to develop its own \nassumptions.\nThe Company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires \njudgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based \non the most conservative level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nPricing vendors are utilized for a majority of Level 1 and Level 2 investments. These vendors either provide a quoted market price \nin an active market or use observable inputs without applying significant adjustments in their pricing. Observable inputs include \nbroker quotes, interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, volatilities and credit risks. The fair value \nof derivative contracts is determined using observable market inputs such as the daily market foreign currency rates, forward \npricing curves, currency volatilities, currency correlations and interest rates and considers nonperformance risk of the Company \nand its counterparties. \nThe Company's fair value measurement process includes comparing fair values to another independent pricing vendor to ensure \nappropriate fair values are recorded.\nRefer to Note 4 — Fair Value Measurements for additional information.\nFOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS\nAdjustments resulting from translating foreign functional currency financial statements into U.S. Dollars are included in the foreign \ncurrency translation adjustment, a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\nThe Company's global subsidiaries have various monetary assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, which are \ndenominated in currencies other than their functional currency.

All derivatives are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and changes in the fair value of \nderivative financial instruments are either recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), Long-term debt or Net \nincome depending on the nature of the underlying exposure, whether the derivative is formally designated as a hedge and, if \ndesignated, the extent to which the hedge is effective. The Company classifies the cash flows at settlement from derivatives in \nthe same category as the cash flows from the related hedged items. For undesignated hedges and designated cash flow hedges, \nthis is primarily within the Cash provided by operations component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. For \ndesignated net investment hedges, this is within the Cash provided by investing activities component of the Consolidated \nStatements of Cash Flows. For the Company's fair value hedges, which are interest rate swaps used to mitigate the change in \nfair value of its fixed-rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates, the related cash flows from periodic interest payments are \nreflected within the Cash provided by operations component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. \nRefer to Note 12 — Risk Management and Derivatives for additional information on the Company's risk management program \nand derivatives.\nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nThe Company accounts for stock-based compensation by estimating the fair value, net of estimated forfeitures, of equity awards \nand recognizing the related expense as Cost of sales or Operating overhead expense, as applicable, in the Consolidated \nStatements of Income on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Substantially all awards vest ratably over four years of \ncontinued employment, with stock options expiring 10 years from the date of grant. Performance-based restricted stock units vest \nbased on the Company's achievement of certain performance criteria throughout the three-year performance period and \ncontinued employment through the vesting date. The fair value of options, stock appreciation rights and employees' purchase \nrights under the employee stock purchase plans (\"ESPPs\") is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair \nvalue of restricted stock and time-vesting restricted stock units is established by the market price on the date of grant.

This approach requires the recognition of deferred \ntax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and \nthe tax basis of assets and liabilities. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount \nmanagement believes is more likely than not to be realized. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable \nearnings and is therefore uncertain. At least quarterly, the Company assesses taxable income in prior carryback periods, the \nscheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and available tax planning strategies. The Company \nuses forecasts of taxable income and considers foreign tax credit utilization in making this assessment of realization, which are \ninherently uncertain and can result in significant variation between estimated and actual results. To the extent the Company \nbelieves that recovery is not likely, a valuation allowance is established against the net deferred tax asset, which increases the \nCompany's income tax expense in the period when such determination is made.\nThe Company recognizes a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not \nthe position will be sustained upon examination by relevant tax authorities. The Company recognizes interest and penalties \nrelated to income tax matters in Income tax expense.\nRefer to Note 7 — Income Taxes for further discussion.\nEARNINGS PER SHARE\nBasic earnings per common share is calculated by dividing Net income by the weighted average number of common shares \noutstanding during the year.

In rare circumstances, the additional period of time may exceed two months due to extenuating circumstances \nrelated to the nature of the forecasted transaction that are outside the control or influence of the Company. \nThe purpose of the Company's foreign exchange risk management program is to lessen both the positive and negative effects of \ncurrency fluctuations on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Foreign currency \nexposures the Company may elect to hedge in this manner include product costs, non-functional currency denominated \nrevenues, intercompany revenues, demand creation expenses, investments in U.S. Dollar denominated available-for-sale debt \nsecurities and certain other intercompany transactions.\nProduct cost foreign currency exposures are primarily generated through non-functional currency denominated product \npurchases. NIKE entities primarily purchase product in two ways: (1) Certain NIKE entities purchase product from the NIKE \nTrading Company (\"NTC\"), a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from third-party factories, \npredominantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the product to NIKE entities in \ntheir respective functional currencies. NTC sales to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency result in a foreign currency \n2023 FORM 10-K   79    \n\n\nexposure for the NTC. (2) Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars. These \npurchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar.\nThe Company's policy permits the utilization of derivatives to reduce its foreign currency exposures where internal netting or \nother strategies cannot be effectively employed. Typically, the Company may enter into hedge contracts starting up to 12 to 24 \nmonths in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental hedges up to 100% of the exposure by the time the \nforecasted transaction occurs. The total notional amount of outstanding foreign currency derivatives designated as cash flow \nhedges was $18.2 billion as of May 31, 2023.\nAs of May 31, 2023, approximately $419 million of deferred net gains (net of tax) on both outstanding and matured derivatives in \nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are expected to be reclassified to Net income during the next 12 months \nconcurrent with the underlying hedged transactions also being recorded in Net income. Actual amounts ultimately reclassified to \nNet income are dependent on the exchange rates in effect when derivative contracts currently outstanding mature. As of May 31, \n2023, the maximum term over which the Company hedges exposures to the variability of cash flows for its forecasted \ntransactions was 27 months.\nFAIR VALUE HEDGES\nThe Company has, in the past, been exposed to the risk of changes in the fair value of certain fixed-rate debt attri",

This credit risk is limited to the unrealized gains \nin such contracts should any of these counterparties fail to perform as contracted. To manage this risk, the Company has \nestablished strict counterparty credit guidelines that are continually monitored.\nThe Company's derivative contracts contain credit risk-related contingent features designed to protect against significant \ndeterioration in counterparties' creditworthiness and their ultimate ability to settle outstanding derivative contracts in the normal \ncourse of business. The Company's bilateral credit-related contingent features generally require the owing entity, either the \nCompany or the derivative counterparty, to post collateral for the portion of the fair value in excess of $50 million should the fair \nvalue of outstanding derivatives per counterparty be greater than $50 million. Additionally, a certain level of decline in credit rating \nof either the Company or the counterparty could trigger collateral requirements.

Financing Activities: This section shows the cash inflows and outflows related to financing activities, such as borrowing, repaying debt, issuing or repurchasing shares, and so on.\n\nSince the provided excerpt does not contain any information about the Cash Flow",

Wait for the next round to run sequential tasks.\n\nFunction #2 (transform_outputs): The second function will aggregate the outputs of the small language models and provide an aggregated string for the supervisor to review.\n-> Filter the jobs based on the output of the small language models (write a custome filter function -- in some steps you might want to filter for a specific keyword, in others you might want to no pass anything back, so you filter out everything!). \n-> Aggregate the jobs based on the task_id and chunk_id.\n\n\n\n# Misc. Information\n\n* Assume a Pydantic model called `JobManifest(BaseModel)` is already in global scope. For your reference, here is the model:\n```\nclass JobManifest(BaseModel):\n    chunk: str  # the actual text for the chunk of the document\n    task: str  # the actual task instruction for the small model\n    advice: str  # optional, any additional advice on how to perform the task\n\n    chunk_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    task_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    job_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n\n```\n\n* Assume a Pydantic model called `JobOutput(BaseModel)` is already in global scope. For your reference, here is the model:\n```\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    citation: Optional[str]\n    answer: Optional[str]\n\n```\n\n* DO NOT rewrite or import the model in your code.\n\n* Function #1 signature will look like:\n```\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        context (List[str]): A list of documents.

Additionally, there has been, and may continue to be, volatility in \ncurrency exchange rates that impact the U.S. Dollar value relative to other international currencies. Our international revenues \nand expenses generally are derived from sales and operations in foreign currencies, and these revenues and expenses are \naffected by currency fluctuations, specifically amounts recorded in foreign currencies and translated into U.S. Dollars for \nconsolidated financial reporting, as weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar adversely affects the U.S. Dollar \nvalue of the Company's foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings. Currency exchange rate fluctuations could also \ndisrupt the business of the independent manufacturers that produce our products by making their purchases of raw materials \nmore expensive and more difficult to finance. Foreign currency fluctuations have adversely affected and could continue to have \nan adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe hedge certain foreign currency exposures to lessen and delay, but not to completely eliminate, the effects of foreign currency \nfluctuations on our financial results.

We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be \nreasonable under the circumstances, as provided in \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results \nof Operations\". The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities \nand equity, and the amount of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources.

We will continue to closely monitor macroeconomic conditions, including potential impacts \nof inflation and rising interest rates on consumer behavior. \n• Inflationary Pressures: Inflationary pressures, including higher product input, freight and logistics costs negatively \nimpacted gross margin for fiscal 2023. The strategic pricing actions we have taken partially offset the impacts of these higher \ncosts.\n• Supply Chain Volatility: Supply chain challenges, macroeconomic conditions and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic \non the manufacturing of our product disrupted the flow of seasonal product in fiscal 2022 and the first quarter of fiscal 2023, \nresulting in elevated inventory levels at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Throughout fiscal 2023, we took action to \nreduce excess inventory by decreasing future inventory purchases and increasing promotional activity. These actions, along \nwith the stabilization of inventory transit times in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2023, resulted in the normalization of \nthe seasonal flow of product in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023.\nNIKE, INC.      \n28\n\n\n• COVID-19 Impacts in Greater China: During the first and second quarters of fiscal 2023, we managed through continued \ntemporary store closures and reduced retail traffic in Greater China, primarily due to COVID-19 related local government \nrestrictions. At the beginning of the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the government mandated restrictions were lifted and we \nexperienced improvement in physical retail traffic. \n• Foreign Currency Impacts: As a global company with significant operations outside the United States, we are exposed to \nrisk arising from foreign currency exchange rates. For fiscal 2023, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates negatively \nimpacted our reported Revenues by approximately $2,859 million, reducing our revenue growth rate to 10% on a reported \nbasis from 16% on a currency-neutral basis. Foreign currency impacts, net of hedges, also reduced our reported Income \nbefore income taxes by approximately $1,023 million.

Revenues were $51.2 billion in fiscal 2023, which increased 10% and 16% compared to fiscal 2022 on a reported \nand currency-neutral basis, respectively. The increase was due to higher revenues in North America, Europe, Middle East & \nAfrica (\"EMEA\"), APLA and Greater China, which contributed approximately 7, 6, 2 and 1 percentage points to NIKE, Inc. \nRevenues, respectively. \n• NIKE Brand revenues, which represented over 90% of NIKE, Inc. Revenues, increased 10% and 16% on a reported and \ncurrency-neutral basis, respectively. This increase was primarily due to higher revenues in Men's, the Jordan Brand, \nWomen's and Kids' which grew 17%, 35%,11% and 10%, respectively, on a wholesale equivalent basis. \n• NIKE Brand footwear revenues increased 20% on a currency-neutral basis, due to higher revenues in Men's, the \nJordan Brand, Women's and Kids'. Unit sales of footwear increased 13%, while higher average selling price (\"ASP\") \nper pair contributed approximately 7 percentage points of footwear revenue growth. Higher ASP was primarily due to \nhigher full-price ASP, net of discounts, on a wholesale equivalent basis, and growth in the size of our NIKE Direct \nbusiness, partially offset by lower NIKE Direct ASP. \n• NIKE Brand apparel revenues increased 8% on a currency-neutral basis, primarily due to higher revenues in Men's. \nUnit sales of apparel increased 4%, while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 4 percentage points of \napparel revenue growth. Higher ASP was primarily due to higher full-price ASP and growth in the size of our NIKE \nDirect business, partially offset by lower NIKE Direct ASP, reflecting higher promotional activity.\n• NIKE Direct revenues increased 14% from $18.7 billion in fiscal 2022 to $21.3 billion in fiscal 2023. On a currency-neutral \nbasis, NIKE Direct revenues increased 20% primarily driven by NIKE Brand Digital sales growth of 24%, comparable store \nsales growth of 14% and the addition of ne",

We manage global foreign exchange risk \ncentrally on a portfolio basis to address those risks material to NIKE, Inc.

Our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate changes on the underlying \nnet exposures being hedged. Where exposures are hedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate \nmovements on our Consolidated Financial Statements; the length of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizons. We do not \nhold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\nNIKE, INC.      \n42\n\n\nRefer to Note 4 — Fair Value Measurements and Note 12 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to \nthe Consolidated Financial Statements for additional description of outstanding derivatives at each reported period end.\nTRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES\nWe conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk. Our most significant \ntransactional foreign currency exposures are:\n• Product Costs — NIKE's product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways:\n1.\nProduct purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity:\na.\nCertain NIKE entities purchase product from the NTC, a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded \nproducts from third-party factories, predominantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the \nU.S. Dollar, then sells the products to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies. NTC sales to a NIKE \nentity with a different functional currency results in a foreign currency exposure for the NTC.\nb.\nOther NIKE entities purchase product directly from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate \na foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar.\nIn both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U.S. Dollar reduces inventory costs incurred by NIKE whereas a stronger \nU.S. Dollar increases its cost.\n2.\nFactory input costs: NIKE operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is \ndesigned to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories' foreign currency \nexposures, some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our \npayments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies (\"factory currency exposure \nindex\") in which the labor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded \nproducts (\"factory input costs\") are denominated.\nAs an offset to the impacts of the fluctuating U.S. Dollar on our non-functional currency denominated product purchases \ndescribed above, a strengthening U.S. Dollar against the",

These sales generate a foreign currency exposure.\n• Other Costs — Non-functional currency denominated costs, such as endorsement contracts, also generate foreign currency \nrisk, though to a lesser extent. \n• Non-Functional Currency Denominated Monetary Assets and Liabilities — Our global subsidiaries have various assets and \nliabilities, primarily receivables and payables, including intercompany receivables and payables, denominated in currencies \nother than their functional currencies. These balance sheet items are subject to remeasurement which may create \nfluctuations in Other (income) expense, net within our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nMANAGING TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES\nTransactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program. We manage \nthese exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect \nto use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted \nfuture cash flows, including certain product cost exposures, non-functional currency denominated external sales and other costs \ndescribed above.

The \nvariable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these U.S. Dollar denominated investments at \nnon-U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under \ngenerally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\"). We utilize forward contracts and/or \noptions to mitigate the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these U.S. Dollar investments. The combination \nof the purchase and sale of the U.S. Dollar investment and the hedging instrument has the effect of partially offsetting the year-\nover-year foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investments are sold. Hedges of the purchase of \nU.S. Dollar denominated available-for-sale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges. \nWe estimate the combination of translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the \nyear-over-year change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in Other (income) expense, net had an unfavorable \nimpact of approximately $1,023 million and a favorable impact of approximately $132 million and $19 million on our Income \nbefore income taxes for the years ended May 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nNET INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES\nWe are also exposed to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our investments in wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries \ndenominated in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar, which could adversely impact the U.S. Dollar value of these investments \nand therefore the value of future repatriated earnings. We have, in the past, hedged and may, in the future, hedge net investment \npositions in certain foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on these net investments.

For fiscal 2023, the \nnet change in working capital compared to the prior year was impacted by unfavorable changes in Accounts payable, offset by \nfavorable impacts from Inventories and Accounts receivable. These changes were, in part, due to reduced inventory purchases in \nthe current period and timing of wholesale shipments.

When the specific criteria to qualify for hedge accounting has been met, \nchanges in the fair value of contracts hedging probable forecasted future cash flows are recorded in Accumulated other \ncomprehensive income (loss), rather than Net income, until the underlying hedged transaction affects Net income. In most cases, \nthis results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into \nNet income sometime after the maturity of the derivative. One of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the notional \nvalue of these derivative contracts should not be in excess of the designated amount of anticipated transactions. By their very \nnature, our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions. When \nthe designated amount of anticipated or actual transactions decline below hedged levels, or if it is no longer probable a \nforecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two-month period of time \nthereafter, we reclassify the cumulative change in fair value of the over-hedged portion of the related hedge contract from \nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to Other (income) expense, net during the quarter in which the decrease \noccurs.

The income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in \nwhich they occur. As the fiscal year progresses, we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by \njurisdiction during the year.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES \nABOUT MARKET RISK\nIn the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures, we employ a variety of financial \ninstruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates. It is our policy to utilize these \nfinancial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures; we do not enter into these \ntransactions for trading or speculative purposes.\nWe are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations, primarily as a result of our international sales, product sourcing and funding \nactivities. Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of \ncurrency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We use forward and option \ncontracts to hedge certain anticipated, but not yet firmly committed, transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the \nrelated receivables and payables, including third-party and intercompany transactions. Where exposures are hedged, our \nprogram has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe timing for hedging exposures, as well as the type and duration of the hedge instruments employed, are guided by our \nhedging policies and determined based upon the nature of the exposure and prevailing market conditions. Typically, the \nCompany may enter into hedge contracts starting 12 to 24 months in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place \nincremental hedges up to 100% of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs. The majority of derivatives \noutstanding as of May 31, 2023, are designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges, primarily for Euro/U.S. Dollar, British \nPound/Euro, Chinese Yuan/U.S. Dollar, and Japanese Yen/U.S. Dollar currency pairs. Refer to Note 12 — Risk Management and \nDerivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nOur earnings are also exposed to movements in short- and long-term market interest rates. Our objective in managing this \ninterest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing \ncosts. To achieve these objectives, we maintain a mix of commercial paper, bank loans, and fixed-rate debt of varying maturities.\nMARKET RISK MEASUREMENT\nWe monitor foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of \nmarket value, sensitivity analysis and Value-at-Risk (\"VaR\").

The VaR determines the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate-\nsensitive financial instruments. The VaR model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. There \nare various modeling techniques that can be used in the VaR computation. Our computations are based on interrelationships \nbetween currencies and interest rates (a \"variance/co-variance\" technique). These interrelationships are a function of foreign \nexchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one-year period. The value of foreign currency \noptions does not change on a one-to-one basis with changes in the underlying currency rate. We adjust the potential loss in \noption value for the estimated sensitivity (the \"delta\" and \"gamma\") to changes in the underlying currency rate. This calculation \nreflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only and does not include the impact of such \nrate fluctuations on non-functional currency transactions (such as anticipated transactions, firm commitments, cash balances and \naccounts and loans receivable and payable), including those which are hedged by these instruments.\nThe VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value we will incur nor does it \nconsider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates. It also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss \nthat may occur. Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates \nand interrelationships, hedging instruments and hedge percentages, timing and other factors.\nThe estimated maximum one-day loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments, derived \nusing the VaR model, was $111 million and $99 million as of May 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The VaR increased year-over-\nyear as a result of an increase in foreign currency volatilities as of May 31, 2023.

Also \nin our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, \n2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control \nover financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the \naccompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express \nopinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting \nbased on our audits.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that \n(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions \nof the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit \npreparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and \nexpenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the \ncompany; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or \ndisposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.

In some markets outside the U.S., these trademarks are licensed \nto third parties who design, distribute, market and sell similar products. Operating results of the Converse brand are reported on a \nstand-alone basis.\nBASIS OF CONSOLIDATION\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of NIKE, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the \"Company\" or \"NIKE\"). All \nsignificant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. \nREVENUE RECOGNITION\nRevenue transactions associated with the sale of NIKE Brand footwear, apparel and equipment, as well as Converse products, \ncomprise a single performance obligation, which consists of the sale of products to customers either through wholesale or direct \nto consumer channels. The Company satisfies the performance obligation and records revenues when transfer of control to the \ncustomer has occurred, based on the terms of sale. A customer is considered to have control once they are able to direct the use \nand receive substantially all of the benefits of the product. \nControl is transferred to wholesale customers upon shipment or upon receipt depending on the country of the sale and the \nagreement with the customer. Control transfers to retail store customers at the time of sale and to substantially all digital \ncommerce customers upon shipment. The transaction price is determined based upon the invoiced sales price, less anticipated \nsales returns, discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers. Payment terms for wholesale transactions depend on the \ncountry of sale or agreement with the customer and payment is generally required within 90 days or less of shipment to or receipt \nby the wholesale customer. Payment is due at the time of sale for retail store and digital commerce transactions.\nConsideration for trademark licensing contracts is earned through sales-based or usage-based royalty arrangements, and the \nassociated revenues are recognized over the license period. \nTaxes assessed by governmental authorities that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing \ntransaction, and are collected by the Company from a customer, are excluded from Revenues and Cost of sales in the \nConsolidated Statements of Income. Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product \nhas transferred to a customer are accounted for as fulfillment costs and are included in Cost of sales when the related revenues \nare recognized.\nSALES-RELATED RESERVES\nConsideration promised in the Company's contracts with customers is variable due to anticipated reductions, such as sales \nreturns, discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers.

The Company makes ongoing estimates relating to \nthe collectability of its accounts receivable and maintains an allowance for expected losses resulting from the inability of its \ncustomers to make required payments. In addition to judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on \nongoing credit evaluations, the Company considers historical levels of credit losses, as well as macroeconomic and industry \ntrends to determine the amount of the allowance.

Factors that would necessitate an \nimpairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant \nadverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the \nobservable market value of an asset, among others. If such facts indicate a potential impairment, the Company would assess the \nrecoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected \nundiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life \nof the primary asset in the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not \nrecoverable, the Company will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies, which would \ntypically include an estimate of discounted cash flows.

If the carrying value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, the goodwill of \nthat reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is determined to be impaired and the Company will record an impairment \ncharge equal to the excess of the carrying value over the related fair value. \nThere were no accumulated impairment losses as of May 31, 2023 and 2022.

The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception and begins recording lease activity at \nthe commencement date, which is generally the date in which the Company takes possession of or controls the physical use of \nthe asset.

Right-of-use (\"ROU\") assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the \nlease term with lease expense recognized on a straight-line basis. The Company's incremental borrowing rate is used to \ndetermine the present value of future lease payments unless the implicit rate is readily determinable. \nLease agreements may contain rent escalation clauses, renewal or termination options, rent holidays or certain landlord \nincentives, including tenant improvement allowances. ROU assets include amounts for scheduled rent increases and are reduced \nby the amount of lease incentives. The lease term includes the non-cancelable period of the lease and options to extend or \nterminate the lease when it is reasonably certain the Company will exercise those options. The Company does not record leases \nwith an initial term of 12 months or less on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and recognizes related lease payments in the \nConsolidated Statements of Income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Fair value is the price the Company would receive to sell an asset or pay to \ntransfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date. The Company uses a three-level \nhierarchy that prioritizes fair value measurements based on the types of inputs used, as follows:\nNIKE, INC.      \n64\n\n\n• Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n• Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; these include \nquoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in \nmarkets that are not active.\n• Level 3: Unobservable inputs with little or no market data available, which require the reporting entity to develop its own \nassumptions.\nThe Company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires \njudgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based \non the most conservative level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nPricing vendors are utilized for a majority of Level 1 and Level 2 investments. These vendors either provide a quoted market price \nin an active market or use observable inputs without applying significant adjustments in their pricing. Observable inputs include \nbroker quotes, interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, volatilities and credit risks. The fair value \nof derivative contracts is determined using observable market inputs such as the daily market foreign currency rates, forward \npricing curves, currency volatilities, currency correlations and interest rates and considers nonperformance risk of the Company \nand its counterparties. \nThe Company's fair value measurement process includes comparing fair values to another independent pricing vendor to ensure \nappropriate fair values are recorded.\nRefer to Note 4 — Fair Value Measurements for additional information.\nFOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS\nAdjustments resulting from translating foreign functional currency financial statements into U.S. Dollars are included in the foreign \ncurrency translation adjustment, a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\nThe Company's global subsidiaries have various monetary assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, which are \ndenominated in currencies other than their functional currency.

For undesignated hedges and designated cash flow hedges, \nthis is primarily within the Cash provided by operations component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. For \ndesignated net investment hedges, this is within the Cash provided by investing activities component of the Consolidated \nStatements of Cash Flows. For the Company's fair value hedges, which are interest rate swaps used to mitigate the change in \nfair value of its fixed-rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates, the related cash flows from periodic interest payments are \nreflected within the Cash provided by operations component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. \nRefer to Note 12 — Risk Management and Derivatives for additional information on the Company's risk management program \nand derivatives.\nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nThe Company accounts for stock-based compensation by estimating the fair value, net of estimated forfeitures, of equity awards \nand recognizing the related expense as Cost of sales or Operating overhead expense, as applicable, in the Consolidated \nStatements of Income on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.

The fair value of options, stock appreciation rights and employees' purchase \nrights under the employee stock purchase plans (\"ESPPs\") is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair \nvalue of restricted stock and time-vesting restricted stock units is established by the market price on the date of grant.

This approach requires the recognition of deferred \ntax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and \nthe tax basis of assets and liabilities. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount \nmanagement believes is more likely than not to be realized. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable \nearnings and is therefore uncertain. At least quarterly, the Company assesses taxable income in prior carryback periods, the \nscheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and available tax planning strategies. The Company \nuses forecasts of taxable income and considers foreign tax credit utilization in making this assessment of realization, which are \ninherently uncertain and can result in significant variation between estimated and actual results. To the extent the Company \nbelieves that recovery is not likely, a valuation allowance is established against the net deferred tax asset, which increases the \nCompany's income tax expense in the period when such determination is made.\nThe Company recognizes a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not \nthe position will be sustained upon examination by relevant tax authorities.

Additionally, the macroeconomic \nenvironment could remain volatile as the risk exists that worsening macroeconomic conditions could have a material, adverse \nimpact on future revenue growth as well as overall profitability. \nRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nIn September 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") ASU \n2022-04, Liabilities — Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations, which \nenhances transparency surrounding the",

In January 2019, the \nEuropean Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether the Netherlands has breached State Aid rules when \ngranting certain tax rulings to the Company. The Company believes the investigation is without merit. If this matter is adversely \nresolved, the Netherlands may be required to assess additional amounts with respect to prior periods, and the Company's \nincome taxes related to prior periods in the Netherlands could increase. \nA portion of the Company's foreign operations benefit from a tax holiday, which is set to expire in 2031.

NTC sales to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency result in a foreign currency \n2023 FORM 10-K   79    \n\n\nexposure for the NTC. (2) Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars. These \npurchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar.\nThe Company's policy permits the utilization of derivatives to reduce its foreign currency exposures where internal netting or \nother strategies cannot be effectively employed. Typically, the Company may enter into hedge contracts starting up to 12 to 24 \nmonths in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental hedges up to 100% of the exposure by the time the \nforecasted transaction occurs. The total notional amount of outstanding foreign currency derivatives designated as cash flow \nhedges was $18.2 billion as of May 31, 2023.\nAs of May 31, 2023, approximately $419 million of deferred net gains (net of tax) on both outstanding and matured derivatives in \nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are expected to be reclassified to Net income during the next 12 months \nconcurrent with the underlying hedged transactions also being recorded in Net income. Actual amounts ultimately reclassified to \nNet income are dependent on the exchange rates in effect when derivative contracts currently outstanding mature. As of May 31, \n2023, the maximum term over which the Company hedges exposures to the variability of cash flows for its forecasted \ntransactions was 27 months.\nFAIR VALUE HEDGES\nThe Company has, in the past, been exposed to the risk of changes in the fair value of certain fixed-rate debt attri",

Derivatives used by the Company to hedge this risk are receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps. \nThe Company had no interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges as of May 31, 2023. \nNET INVESTMENT HEDGES\nThe Company has, in the past, hedged and may, in the future, hedge the risk of variability in foreign currency-denominated net \ninvestments in wholly-owned international operations. All changes in fair value of the derivatives designated as net investment \nhedges are reported in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) along with the foreign currency translation adjustments \non those investments. The Company had no outstanding net investment hedges as of May 31, 2023.\nUNDESIGNATED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS\nThe Company may elect to enter into foreign exchange forwards to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and \nliabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These undesignated instruments are recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or \nliability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with their corresponding change in fair value recognized in Other (income) expense, \nnet, together with the remeasurement gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position. The total notional amount of \noutstanding undesignated derivative instruments was $4.7 billion as of May 31, 2023.\nCREDIT RISK\nThe Company is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to hedging instruments. The \ncounterparties to all derivative transactions are major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings; however, this \ndoes not eliminate the Company's exposure to credit risk with these institutions. This credit risk is limited to the unrealized gains \nin such contracts should any of these counterparties fail to perform as contracted. To manage this risk, the Company has \nestablished strict counterparty credit guidelines that are continually monitored.\nThe Company's derivative contracts contain credit risk-related contingent features designed to protect against significant \ndeterioration in counterparties' creditworthiness and their ultimate ability to settle outstanding derivative contracts in the normal \ncourse of business. The Company's bilateral credit-related contingent features generally require the owing entity, either the \nCompany or the derivative counterparty, to post collateral for the portion of the fair value in excess of $50 million should the fair \nvalue of outstanding derivatives per counterparty be greater than $50 million. Additionally, a certain level of decline in credit rating \nof either the Company or the counterparty could trigger collateral requirements. As of May 31, 2023, the Company was in \ncompliance with all credit risk-related contingent features, and derivative instruments with such features were in a net liability \nposition of approximately $2 million.

      "output": "We have gathered several pieces of information from the junior models regarding Nike's cash flow activities for FY2023. The key figures extracted are:\n\n1. **Operating Activities**: \n   - $5,841 million inflow (Chunk #68)\n   - $5,070 million inflow (Chunk #82)\n   - $5,841 million inflow (Chunk #83)\n   - $575 million from operating leases (Chunk #117)\n\n2. **Investing Activities**: \n   - $564 million inflow (Chunk #68)\n   - $1,444 million outflow (Chunk #82)\n   - $564 million inflow (Chunk #83)\n\n3. **Financing Activities**: \n   - $7,447 million outflow (Chunk #68)\n   - $1,044 million outflow (Chunk #82)\n   - $7,447 million outflow (Chunk #83)\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Sufficiency of Information**: \n   - We have conflicting figures for operating and financing activities. The figures for investing activities are consistent between chunks #68 and #83, indicating a $564 million inflow.\n\n2. **Conflicting Information**:\n   - For operating activities, the figures $5,841 million and $5,070 million are inconsistent. The $5,841 million figure appears twice, suggesting it might be more reliable.\n   - For financing activities, the figures $7,447 million and $1,044 million are inconsistent. The $7,447 million figure appears twice, suggesting it might be more reliable.\n\n3. **Missing Information**:\n   - We need confirmation of the correct figures for operating and financing activities to ensure accuracy.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the consistent figures, investing activities brought in $564 million. If we assume the $5,841 million inflow for operating activities and the $7,447 million outflow for financing activities are correct, then operating activities brought in the most cash flow.\n   - To conclusively answer the question, we need to verify the correct figures for operating and financing activities, possibly by referring to the original document or additional reliable sources."

Historically, revenues in the first and fourth \nfiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third fiscal quarters. However, the mix of product sales may vary \nconsiderably as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear, apparel and equipment, \nas well as other macroeconomic, strategic, operating and logistics-related factors.\nBecause NIKE is a consumer products company, the relative popularity and availability of various sports and fitness activities, as \nwell as changing design trends, affect the demand for our products. We must, therefore, respond to trends and shifts in consumer \npreferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings, developing new products, styles and categories and influencing \nsports and fitness preferences through extensive marketing. Failure to respond in a timely and adequate manner could have a \nmaterial adverse effect on our sales and profitability. This is a continuing risk. Refer to Item 1A.

Additionally, there has been, and may continue to be, volatility in \ncurrency exchange rates that impact the U.S. Dollar value relative to other international currencies. Our international revenues \nand expenses generally are derived from sales and operations in foreign currencies, and these revenues and expenses are \naffected by currency fluctuations, specifically amounts recorded in foreign currencies and translated into U.S. Dollars for \nconsolidated financial reporting, as weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar adversely affects the U.S. Dollar \nvalue of the Company's foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings. Currency exchange rate fluctuations could also \ndisrupt the business of the independent manufacturers that produce our products by making their purchases of raw materials \nmore expensive and more difficult to finance. Foreign currency fluctuations have adversely affected and could continue to have \nan adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe hedge certain foreign currency exposures to lessen and delay, but not to completely eliminate, the effects of foreign currency \nfluctuations on our financial results.

We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be \nreasonable under the circumstances, as provided in \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results \nof Operations\". The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities \nand equity, and the amount of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources.

We will continue to closely monitor macroeconomic conditions, including potential impacts \nof inflation and rising interest rates on consumer behavior. \n• Inflationary Pressures: Inflationary pressures, including higher product input, freight and logistics costs negatively \nimpacted gross margin for fiscal 2023. The strategic pricing actions we have taken partially offset the impacts of these higher \ncosts.\n• Supply Chain Volatility: Supply chain challenges, macroeconomic conditions and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic \non the manufacturing of our product disrupted the flow of seasonal product in fiscal 2022 and the first quarter of fiscal 2023, \nresulting in elevated inventory levels at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Throughout fiscal 2023, we took action to \nreduce excess inventory by decreasing future inventory purchases and increasing promotional activity. These actions, along \nwith the stabilization of inventory transit times in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2023, resulted in the normalization of \nthe seasonal flow of product in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023.\nNIKE, INC.      \n28\n\n\n• COVID-19 Impacts in Greater China: During the first and second quarters of fiscal 2023, we managed through continued \ntemporary store closures and reduced retail traffic in Greater China, primarily due to COVID-19 related local government \nrestrictions. At the beginning of the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the government mandated restrictions were lifted and we \nexperienced improvement in physical retail traffic. \n• Foreign Currency Impacts: As a global company with significant operations outside the United States, we are exposed to \nrisk arising from foreign currency exchange rates. For fiscal 2023, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates negatively \nimpacted our reported Revenues by approximately $2,859 million, reducing our revenue growth rate to 10% on a reported \nbasis from 16% on a currency-neutral basis. Foreign currency impacts, net of hedges, also reduced our reported Income \nbefore income taxes by approximately $1,023 million.

Revenues were $51.2 billion in fiscal 2023, which increased 10% and 16% compared to fiscal 2022 on a reported \nand currency-neutral basis, respectively. The increase was due to higher revenues in North America, Europe, Middle East & \nAfrica (\"EMEA\"), APLA and Greater China, which contributed approximately 7, 6, 2 and 1 percentage points to NIKE, Inc. \nRevenues, respectively. \n• NIKE Brand revenues, which represented over 90% of NIKE, Inc. Revenues, increased 10% and 16% on a reported and \ncurrency-neutral basis, respectively. This increase was primarily due to higher revenues in Men's, the Jordan Brand, \nWomen's and Kids' which grew 17%, 35%,11% and 10%, respectively, on a wholesale equivalent basis. \n• NIKE Brand footwear revenues increased 20% on a currency-neutral basis, due to higher revenues in Men's, the \nJordan Brand, Women's and Kids'. Unit sales of footwear increased 13%, while higher average selling price (\"ASP\") \nper pair contributed approximately 7 percentage points of footwear revenue growth. Higher ASP was primarily due to \nhigher full-price ASP, net of discounts, on a wholesale equivalent basis, and growth in the size of our NIKE Direct \nbusiness, partially offset by lower NIKE Direct ASP. \n• NIKE Brand apparel revenues increased 8% on a currency-neutral basis, primarily due to higher revenues in Men's. \nUnit sales of apparel increased 4%, while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 4 percentage points of \napparel revenue growth. Higher ASP was primarily due to higher full-price ASP and growth in the size of our NIKE \nDirect business, partially offset by lower NIKE Direct ASP, reflecting higher promotional activity.\n• NIKE Direct revenues increased 14% from $18.7 billion in fiscal 2022 to $21.3 billion in fiscal 2023. On a currency-neutral \nbasis, NIKE Direct revenues increased 20% primarily driven by NIKE Brand Digital sales growth of 24%, comparable store \nsales growth of 14% and the addition of ne",

We manage global foreign exchange risk \ncentrally on a portfolio basis to address those risks material to NIKE, Inc.

Our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate changes on the underlying \nnet exposures being hedged. Where exposures are hedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate \nmovements on our Consolidated Financial Statements; the length of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizons. We do not \nhold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\nNIKE, INC.      \n42\n\n\nRefer to Note 4 — Fair Value Measurements and Note 12 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to \nthe Consolidated Financial Statements for additional description of outstanding derivatives at each reported period end.\nTRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES\nWe conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk. Our most significant \ntransactional foreign currency exposures are:\n• Product Costs — NIKE's product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways:\n1.\nProduct purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity:\na.\nCertain NIKE entities purchase product from the NTC, a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded \nproducts from third-party factories, predominantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the \nU.S. Dollar, then sells the products to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies. NTC sales to a NIKE \nentity with a different functional currency results in a foreign currency exposure for the NTC.\nb.\nOther NIKE entities purchase product directly from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate \na foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar.\nIn both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U.S. Dollar reduces inventory costs incurred by NIKE whereas a stronger \nU.S. Dollar increases its cost.\n2.\nFactory input costs: NIKE operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is \ndesigned to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories' foreign currency \nexposures, some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our \npayments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies (\"factory currency exposure \nindex\") in which the labor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded \nproducts (\"factory input costs\") are denominated.\nAs an offset to the impacts of the fluctuating U.S. Dollar on our non-functional currency denominated product purchases \ndescribed above, a strengthening U.S. Dollar against the",

These sales generate a foreign currency exposure.\n• Other Costs — Non-functional currency denominated costs, such as endorsement contracts, also generate foreign currency \nrisk, though to a lesser extent. \n• Non-Functional Currency Denominated Monetary Assets and Liabilities — Our global subsidiaries have various assets and \nliabilities, primarily receivables and payables, including intercompany receivables and payables, denominated in currencies \nother than their functional currencies. These balance sheet items are subject to remeasurement which may create \nfluctuations in Other (income) expense, net within our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nMANAGING TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES\nTransactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program. We manage \nthese exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect \nto use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted \nfuture cash flows, including certain product cost exposures, non-functional currency denominated external sales and other costs \ndescribed above.

The \nvariable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these U.S. Dollar denominated investments at \nnon-U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under \ngenerally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\"). We utilize forward contracts and/or \noptions to mitigate the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these U.S. Dollar investments. The combination \nof the purchase and sale of the U.S. Dollar investment and the hedging instrument has the effect of partially offsetting the year-\nover-year foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investments are sold. Hedges of the purchase of \nU.S. Dollar denominated available-for-sale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges. \nWe estimate the combination of translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the \nyear-over-year change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in Other (income) expense, net had an unfavorable \nimpact of approximately $1,023 million and a favorable impact of approximately $132 million and $19 million on our Income \nbefore income taxes for the years ended May 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nNET INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES\nWe are also exposed to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our investments in wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries \ndenominated in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar, which could adversely impact the U.S. Dollar value of these investments \nand therefore the value of future repatriated earnings. We have, in the past, hedged and may, in the future, hedge net investment \npositions in certain foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on these net investments.

For fiscal 2023, the \nnet change in working capital compared to the prior year was impacted by unfavorable changes in Accounts payable, offset by \nfavorable impacts from Inventories and Accounts receivable. These changes were, in part, due to reduced inventory purchases in \nthe current period and timing of wholesale shipments.

When the specific criteria to qualify for hedge accounting has been met, \nchanges in the fair value of contracts hedging probable forecasted future cash flows are recorded in Accumulated other \ncomprehensive income (loss), rather than Net income, until the underlying hedged transaction affects Net income. In most cases, \nthis results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into \nNet income sometime after the maturity of the derivative. One of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the notional \nvalue of these derivative contracts should not be in excess of the designated amount of anticipated transactions. By their very \nnature, our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions. When \nthe designated amount of anticipated or actual transactions decline below hedged levels, or if it is no longer probable a \nforecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two-month period of time \nthereafter, we reclassify the cumulative change in fair value of the over-hedged portion of the related hedge contract from \nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to Other (income) expense, net during the quarter in which the decrease \noccurs.

The income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in \nwhich they occur. As the fiscal year progresses, we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by \njurisdiction during the year.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES \nABOUT MARKET RISK\nIn the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures, we employ a variety of financial \ninstruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates. It is our policy to utilize these \nfinancial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures; we do not enter into these \ntransactions for trading or speculative purposes.\nWe are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations, primarily as a result of our international sales, product sourcing and funding \nactivities. Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of \ncurrency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We use forward and option \ncontracts to hedge certain anticipated, but not yet firmly committed, transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the \nrelated receivables and payables, including third-party and intercompany transactions. Where exposures are hedged, our \nprogram has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe timing for hedging exposures, as well as the type and duration of the hedge instruments employed, are guided by our \nhedging policies and determined based upon the nature of the exposure and prevailing market conditions. Typically, the \nCompany may enter into hedge contracts starting 12 to 24 months in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place \nincremental hedges up to 100% of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs. The majority of derivatives \noutstanding as of May 31, 2023, are designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges, primarily for Euro/U.S. Dollar, British \nPound/Euro, Chinese Yuan/U.S. Dollar, and Japanese Yen/U.S. Dollar currency pairs. Refer to Note 12 — Risk Management and \nDerivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nOur earnings are also exposed to movements in short- and long-term market interest rates. Our objective in managing this \ninterest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing \ncosts. To achieve these objectives, we maintain a mix of commercial paper, bank loans, and fixed-rate debt of varying maturities.\nMARKET RISK MEASUREMENT\nWe monitor foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of \nmarket value, sensitivity analysis and Value-at-Risk (\"VaR\").

The VaR determines the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate-\nsensitive financial instruments. The VaR model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. There \nare various modeling techniques that can be used in the VaR computation. Our computations are based on interrelationships \nbetween currencies and interest rates (a \"variance/co-variance\" technique). These interrelationships are a function of foreign \nexchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one-year period. The value of foreign currency \noptions does not change on a one-to-one basis with changes in the underlying currency rate. We adjust the potential loss in \noption value for the estimated sensitivity (the \"delta\" and \"gamma\") to changes in the underlying currency rate. This calculation \nreflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only and does not include the impact of such \nrate fluctuations on non-functional currency transactions (such as anticipated transactions, firm commitments, cash balances and \naccounts and loans receivable and payable), including those which are hedged by these instruments.\nThe VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value we will incur nor does it \nconsider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates. It also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss \nthat may occur. Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates \nand interrelationships, hedging instruments and hedge percentages, timing and other factors.\nThe estimated maximum one-day loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments, derived \nusing the VaR model, was $111 million and $99 million as of May 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The VaR increased year-over-\nyear as a result of an increase in foreign currency volatilities as of May 31, 2023.

Also \nin our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, \n2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control \nover financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the \naccompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express \nopinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting \nbased on our audits.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that \n(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions \nof the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit \npreparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and \nexpenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the \ncompany; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or \ndisposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.

In some markets outside the U.S., these trademarks are licensed \nto third parties who design, distribute, market and sell similar products. Operating results of the Converse brand are reported on a \nstand-alone basis.\nBASIS OF CONSOLIDATION\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of NIKE, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the \"Company\" or \"NIKE\"). All \nsignificant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. \nREVENUE RECOGNITION\nRevenue transactions associated with the sale of NIKE Brand footwear, apparel and equipment, as well as Converse products, \ncomprise a single performance obligation, which consists of the sale of products to customers either through wholesale or direct \nto consumer channels. The Company satisfies the performance obligation and records revenues when transfer of control to the \ncustomer has occurred, based on the terms of sale. A customer is considered to have control once they are able to direct the use \nand receive substantially all of the benefits of the product. \nControl is transferred to wholesale customers upon shipment or upon receipt depending on the country of the sale and the \nagreement with the customer. Control transfers to retail store customers at the time of sale and to substantially all digital \ncommerce customers upon shipment. The transaction price is determined based upon the invoiced sales price, less anticipated \nsales returns, discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers. Payment terms for wholesale transactions depend on the \ncountry of sale or agreement with the customer and payment is generally required within 90 days or less of shipment to or receipt \nby the wholesale customer. Payment is due at the time of sale for retail store and digital commerce transactions.\nConsideration for trademark licensing contracts is earned through sales-based or usage-based royalty arrangements, and the \nassociated revenues are recognized over the license period. \nTaxes assessed by governmental authorities that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing \ntransaction, and are collected by the Company from a customer, are excluded from Revenues and Cost of sales in the \nConsolidated Statements of Income. Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product \nhas transferred to a customer are accounted for as fulfillment costs and are included in Cost of sales when the related revenues \nare recognized.\nSALES-RELATED RESERVES\nConsideration promised in the Company's contracts with customers is variable due to anticipated reductions, such as sales \nreturns, discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers.

The Company makes ongoing estimates relating to \nthe collectability of its accounts receivable and maintains an allowance for expected losses resulting from the inability of its \ncustomers to make required payments. In addition to judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on \nongoing credit evaluations, the Company considers historical levels of credit losses, as well as macroeconomic and industry \ntrends to determine the amount of the allowance.

Factors that would necessitate an \nimpairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant \nadverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the \nobservable market value of an asset, among others. If such facts indicate a potential impairment, the Company would assess the \nrecoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected \nundiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life \nof the primary asset in the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not \nrecoverable, the Company will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies, which would \ntypically include an estimate of discounted cash flows.

If the carrying value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, the goodwill of \nthat reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is determined to be impaired and the Company will record an impairment \ncharge equal to the excess of the carrying value over the related fair value. \nThere were no accumulated impairment losses as of May 31, 2023 and 2022.

The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception and begins recording lease activity at \nthe commencement date, which is generally the date in which the Company takes possession of or controls the physical use of \nthe asset.

Right-of-use (\"ROU\") assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the \nlease term with lease expense recognized on a straight-line basis. The Company's incremental borrowing rate is used to \ndetermine the present value of future lease payments unless the implicit rate is readily determinable. \nLease agreements may contain rent escalation clauses, renewal or termination options, rent holidays or certain landlord \nincentives, including tenant improvement allowances. ROU assets include amounts for scheduled rent increases and are reduced \nby the amount of lease incentives. The lease term includes the non-cancelable period of the lease and options to extend or \nterminate the lease when it is reasonably certain the Company will exercise those options. The Company does not record leases \nwith an initial term of 12 months or less on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and recognizes related lease payments in the \nConsolidated Statements of Income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Fair value is the price the Company would receive to sell an asset or pay to \ntransfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date. The Company uses a three-level \nhierarchy that prioritizes fair value measurements based on the types of inputs used, as follows:\nNIKE, INC.      \n64\n\n\n• Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n• Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; these include \nquoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in \nmarkets that are not active.\n• Level 3: Unobservable inputs with little or no market data available, which require the reporting entity to develop its own \nassumptions.\nThe Company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires \njudgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based \non the most conservative level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nPricing vendors are utilized for a majority of Level 1 and Level 2 investments. These vendors either provide a quoted market price \nin an active market or use observable inputs without applying significant adjustments in their pricing. Observable inputs include \nbroker quotes, interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, volatilities and credit risks. The fair value \nof derivative contracts is determined using observable market inputs such as the daily market foreign currency rates, forward \npricing curves, currency volatilities, currency correlations and interest rates and considers nonperformance risk of the Company \nand its counterparties. \nThe Company's fair value measurement process includes comparing fair values to another independent pricing vendor to ensure \nappropriate fair values are recorded.\nRefer to Note 4 — Fair Value Measurements for additional information.\nFOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS\nAdjustments resulting from translating foreign functional currency financial statements into U.S. Dollars are included in the foreign \ncurrency translation adjustment, a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\nThe Company's global subsidiaries have various monetary assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, which are \ndenominated in currencies other than their functional currency.

For undesignated hedges and designated cash flow hedges, \nthis is primarily within the Cash provided by operations component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. For \ndesignated net investment hedges, this is within the Cash provided by investing activities component of the Consolidated \nStatements of Cash Flows. For the Company's fair value hedges, which are interest rate swaps used to mitigate the change in \nfair value of its fixed-rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates, the related cash flows from periodic interest payments are \nreflected within the Cash provided by operations component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. \nRefer to Note 12 — Risk Management and Derivatives for additional information on the Company's risk management program \nand derivatives.\nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nThe Company accounts for stock-based compensation by estimating the fair value, net of estimated forfeitures, of equity awards \nand recognizing the related expense as Cost of sales or Operating overhead expense, as applicable, in the Consolidated \nStatements of Income on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.

The fair value of options, stock appreciation rights and employees' purchase \nrights under the employee stock purchase plans (\"ESPPs\") is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair \nvalue of restricted stock and time-vesting restricted stock units is established by the market price on the date of grant.

This approach requires the recognition of deferred \ntax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and \nthe tax basis of assets and liabilities. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount \nmanagement believes is more likely than not to be realized. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable \nearnings and is therefore uncertain. At least quarterly, the Company assesses taxable income in prior carryback periods, the \nscheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and available tax planning strategies. The Company \nuses forecasts of taxable income and considers foreign tax credit utilization in making this assessment of realization, which are \ninherently uncertain and can result in significant variation between estimated and actual results. To the extent the Company \nbelieves that recovery is not likely, a valuation allowance is established against the net deferred tax asset, which increases the \nCompany's income tax expense in the period when such determination is made.\nThe Company recognizes a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not \nthe position will be sustained upon examination by relevant tax authorities.

Additionally, the macroeconomic \nenvironment could remain volatile as the risk exists that worsening macroeconomic conditions could have a material, adverse \nimpact on future revenue growth as well as overall profitability. \nRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nIn September 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") ASU \n2022-04, Liabilities — Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations, which \nenhances transparency surrounding the",

In January 2019, the \nEuropean Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether the Netherlands has breached State Aid rules when \ngranting certain tax rulings to the Company. The Company believes the investigation is without merit. If this matter is adversely \nresolved, the Netherlands may be required to assess additional amounts with respect to prior periods, and the Company's \nincome taxes related to prior periods in the Netherlands could increase. \nA portion of the Company's foreign operations benefit from a tax holiday, which is set to expire in 2031.

NTC sales to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency result in a foreign currency \n2023 FORM 10-K   79    \n\n\nexposure for the NTC. (2) Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars. These \npurchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar.\nThe Company's policy permits the utilization of derivatives to reduce its foreign currency exposures where internal netting or \nother strategies cannot be effectively employed. Typically, the Company may enter into hedge contracts starting up to 12 to 24 \nmonths in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental hedges up to 100% of the exposure by the time the \nforecasted transaction occurs. The total notional amount of outstanding foreign currency derivatives designated as cash flow \nhedges was $18.2 billion as of May 31, 2023.\nAs of May 31, 2023, approximately $419 million of deferred net gains (net of tax) on both outstanding and matured derivatives in \nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are expected to be reclassified to Net income during the next 12 months \nconcurrent with the underlying hedged transactions also being recorded in Net income. Actual amounts ultimately reclassified to \nNet income are dependent on the exchange rates in effect when derivative contracts currently outstanding mature. As of May 31, \n2023, the maximum term over which the Company hedges exposures to the variability of cash flows for its forecasted \ntransactions was 27 months.\nFAIR VALUE HEDGES\nThe Company has, in the past, been exposed to the risk of changes in the fair value of certain fixed-rate debt attri",

Derivatives used by the Company to hedge this risk are receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps. \nThe Company had no interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges as of May 31, 2023. \nNET INVESTMENT HEDGES\nThe Company has, in the past, hedged and may, in the future, hedge the risk of variability in foreign currency-denominated net \ninvestments in wholly-owned international operations. All changes in fair value of the derivatives designated as net investment \nhedges are reported in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) along with the foreign currency translation adjustments \non those investments. The Company had no outstanding net investment hedges as of May 31, 2023.\nUNDESIGNATED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS\nThe Company may elect to enter into foreign exchange forwards to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and \nliabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These undesignated instruments are recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or \nliability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with their corresponding change in fair value recognized in Other (income) expense, \nnet, together with the remeasurement gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position. The total notional amount of \noutstanding undesignated derivative instruments was $4.7 billion as of May 31, 2023.\nCREDIT RISK\nThe Company is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to hedging instruments. The \ncounterparties to all derivative transactions are major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings; however, this \ndoes not eliminate the Company's exposure to credit risk with these institutions. This credit risk is limited to the unrealized gains \nin such contracts should any of these counterparties fail to perform as contracted. To manage this risk, the Company has \nestablished strict counterparty credit guidelines that are continually monitored.\nThe Company's derivative contracts contain credit risk-related contingent features designed to protect against significant \ndeterioration in counterparties' creditworthiness and their ultimate ability to settle outstanding derivative contracts in the normal \ncourse of business. The Company's bilateral credit-related contingent features generally require the owing entity, either the \nCompany or the derivative counterparty, to post collateral for the portion of the fair value in excess of $50 million should the fair \nvalue of outstanding derivatives per counterparty be greater than $50 million. Additionally, a certain level of decline in credit rating \nof either the Company or the counterparty could trigger collateral requirements. As of May 31, 2023, the Company was in \ncompliance with all credit risk-related contingent features, and derivative instruments with such features were in a net liability \nposition of approximately $2 million.

      "output": "We have gathered some information from the junior models regarding Nike's cash flow activities for FY2023. The outputs provide figures for operating, investing, and financing activities, but there are inconsistencies and gaps in the data.\n\n1. **Information Gathered:**\n   - Operating activities: Figures are inconsistent, with $5,841 million and $6,421 million reported as inflows.\n   - Investing activities: Consistently reported as a $564 million inflow.\n   - Financing activities: Figures are inconsistent, with $7,447 million and $1,044 million reported as outflows.\n\n2. **Sufficiency of Information:**\n   - The information is not entirely sufficient due to inconsistencies in the figures for operating and financing activities. We need reliable and consistent data to make a definitive conclusion.\n\n3. **Missing Information:**\n   - We need consistent and verified figures for operating and financing activities to determine which activity brought in the most or lost the least cash flow.\n\n4. **Deriving the Answer:**\n   - If we had consistent data, we would compare the net cash flow figures for each activity. The activity with the highest positive cash flow or the smallest negative cash flow would be the answer.\n\n5. **Conflicting Answers:**\n   - To resolve conflicting answers, we should rely on the citations provided. The citation from chunk #68 indicates that operating activities had a $5,841 million inflow, investing activities had a $564 million inflow, and financing activities had a $7,447 million outflow. This citation should be considered more reliable unless further verification is possible.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the most reliable citation, operating activities brought in the most cash flow for Nike in FY2023, with a $5,841 million inflow. However, due to inconsistencies, further verification is recommended."

NIKE is the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. We sell our products \nthrough NIKE Direct operations, which are comprised of both NIKE-owned retail stores and sales through our digital platforms \n(also referred to as \"NIKE Brand Digital\"), to retail accounts and to a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales \nrepresentatives in nearly all countries around the world.

We believe this approach allows us to create products that \nbetter meet individual consumer needs while accelerating our largest growth opportunities.\nNIKE's athletic footwear products are designed primarily for specific athletic use, although a large percentage of the products are \nworn for casual or leisure purposes. We place considerable emphasis on innovation and high-quality construction in the \ndevelopment and manufacturing of our products. Our Men's, Women's and Jordan Brand footwear products currently lead in \nfootwear sales and we expect them to continue to do so.\nWe also sell sports apparel, which features the same trademarks and are sold predominantly through the same marketing and \ndistribution channels as athletic footwear. Our sports apparel, similar to our athletic footwear products, is designed primarily for \nathletic use, although many of the products are worn for casual or leisure purposes, and demonstrates our commitment to \ninnovation and high-quality construction. Our Men's and Women's apparel products currently lead in apparel sales and we expect \nthem to continue to do so. We often market footwear, apparel and accessories in \"collections\" of similar use or by category.

However, the mix of product sales may vary \nconsiderably as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear, apparel and equipment, \nas well as other macroeconomic, strategic, operating and logistics-related factors.\nBecause NIKE is a consumer products company, the relative popularity and availability of various sports and fitness activities, as \nwell as changing design trends, affect the demand for our products. We must, therefore, respond to trends and shifts in consumer \npreferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings, developing new products, styles and categories and influencing \nsports and fitness preferences through extensive marketing. Failure to respond in a timely and adequate manner could have a \nmaterial adverse effect on our sales and profitability. This is a continuing risk. Refer to Item 1A.

We will continue to closely monitor macroeconomic conditions, including potential impacts \nof inflation and rising interest rates on consumer behavior. \n• Inflationary Pressures: Inflationary pressures, including higher product input, freight and logistics costs negatively \nimpacted gross margin for fiscal 2023. The strategic pricing actions we have taken partially offset the impacts of these higher \ncosts.\n• Supply Chain Volatility: Supply chain challenges, macroeconomic conditions and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic \non the manufacturing of our product disrupted the flow of seasonal product in fiscal 2022 and the first quarter of fiscal 2023, \nresulting in elevated inventory levels at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Throughout fiscal 2023, we took action to \nreduce excess inventory by decreasing future inventory purchases and increasing promotional activity. These actions, along \nwith the stabilization of inventory transit times in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2023, resulted in the normalization of \nthe seasonal flow of product in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023.\nNIKE, INC.      \n28\n\n\n• COVID-19 Impacts in Greater China: During the first and second quarters of fiscal 2023, we managed through continued \ntemporary store closures and reduced retail traffic in Greater China, primarily due to COVID-19 related local government \nrestrictions. At the beginning of the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the government mandated restrictions were lifted and we \nexperienced improvement in physical retail traffic. \n• Foreign Currency Impacts: As a global company with significant operations outside the United States, we are exposed to \nrisk arising from foreign currency exchange rates. For fiscal 2023, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates negatively \nimpacted our reported Revenues by approximately $2,859 million, reducing our revenue growth rate to 10% on a reported \nbasis from 16% on a currency-neutral basis. Foreign currency impacts, net of hedges, also reduced our reported Income \nbefore income taxes by approximately $1,023 million.

Revenues were $51.2 billion in fiscal 2023, which increased 10% and 16% compared to fiscal 2022 on a reported \nand currency-neutral basis, respectively. The increase was due to higher revenues in North America, Europe, Middle East & \nAfrica (\"EMEA\"), APLA and Greater China, which contributed approximately 7, 6, 2 and 1 percentage points to NIKE, Inc. \nRevenues, respectively. \n• NIKE Brand revenues, which represented over 90% of NIKE, Inc. Revenues, increased 10% and 16% on a reported and \ncurrency-neutral basis, respectively. This increase was primarily due to higher revenues in Men's, the Jordan Brand, \nWomen's and Kids' which grew 17%, 35%,11% and 10%, respectively, on a wholesale equivalent basis. \n• NIKE Brand footwear revenues increased 20% on a currency-neutral basis, due to higher revenues in Men's, the \nJordan Brand, Women's and Kids'. Unit sales of footwear increased 13%, while higher average selling price (\"ASP\") \nper pair contributed approximately 7 percentage points of footwear revenue growth. Higher ASP was primarily due to \nhigher full-price ASP, net of discounts, on a wholesale equivalent basis, and growth in the size of our NIKE Direct \nbusiness, partially offset by lower NIKE Direct ASP. \n• NIKE Brand apparel revenues increased 8% on a currency-neutral basis, primarily due to higher revenues in Men's. \nUnit sales of apparel increased 4%, while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 4 percentage points of \napparel revenue growth. Higher ASP was primarily due to higher full-price ASP and growth in the size of our NIKE \nDirect business, partially offset by lower NIKE Direct ASP, reflecting higher promotional activity.\n• NIKE Direct revenues increased 14% from $18.7 billion in fiscal 2022 to $21.3 billion in fiscal 2023. On a currency-neutral \nbasis, NIKE Direct revenues increased 20% primarily driven by NIKE Brand Digital sales growth of 24%, comparable store \nsales growth of 14% and the addition of ne",

We manage global foreign exchange risk \ncentrally on a portfolio basis to address those risks material to NIKE, Inc.

Our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate changes on the underlying \nnet exposures being hedged. Where exposures are hedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate \nmovements on our Consolidated Financial Statements; the length of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizons.

Our most significant \ntransactional foreign currency exposures are:\n• Product Costs — NIKE's product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways:\n1.\nProduct purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity:\na.\nCertain NIKE entities purchase product from the NTC, a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded \nproducts from third-party factories, predominantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the \nU.S. Dollar, then sells the products to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies. NTC sales to a NIKE \nentity with a different functional currency results in a foreign currency exposure for the NTC.\nb.\nOther NIKE entities purchase product directly from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate \na foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar.\nIn both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U.S. Dollar reduces inventory costs incurred by NIKE whereas a stronger \nU.S. Dollar increases its cost.\n2.\nFactory input costs: NIKE operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is \ndesigned to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories' foreign currency \nexposures, some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our \npayments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies (\"factory currency exposure \nindex\") in which the labor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded \nproducts (\"factory input costs\") are denominated.\nAs an offset to the impacts of the fluctuating U.S. Dollar on our non-functional currency denominated product purchases \ndescribed above, a strengthening U.S. Dollar against the",

Conversely, a weakening U.S. Dollar against the indexed foreign currencies \nincreases our inventory cost.\n• Non-Functional Currency Denominated External Sales — A portion of our NIKE Brand and Converse revenues associated \nwith European operations are earned in currencies other than the Euro (e.g., the British Pound) but are recognized at a \nsubsidiary that uses the Euro as its functional currency. These sales generate a foreign currency exposure.\n• Other Costs — Non-functional currency denominated costs, such as endorsement contracts, also generate foreign currency \nrisk, though to a lesser extent. \n• Non-Functional Currency Denominated Monetary Assets and Liabilities — Our global subsidiaries have various assets and \nliabilities, primarily receivables and payables, including intercompany receivables and payables, denominated in currencies \nother than their functional currencies. These balance sheet items are subject to remeasurement which may create \nfluctuations in Other (income) expense, net within our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nMANAGING TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES\nTransactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program. We manage \nthese exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect \nto use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted \nfuture cash flows, including certain product cost exposures, non-functional currency denominated external sales and other costs \ndescribed above.

We utilize forward contracts and/or \noptions to mitigate the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these U.S. Dollar investments. The combination \nof the purchase and sale of the U.S. Dollar investment and the hedging instrument has the effect of partially offsetting the year-\nover-year foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investments are sold. Hedges of the purchase of \nU.S. Dollar denominated available-for-sale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges. \nWe estimate the combination of translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the \nyear-over-year change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in Other (income) expense, net had an unfavorable \nimpact of approximately $1,023 million and a favorable impact of approximately $132 million and $19 million on our Income \nbefore income taxes for the years ended May 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nNET INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES\nWe are also exposed to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our investments in wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries \ndenominated in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar, which could adversely impact the U.S. Dollar value of these investments \nand therefore the value of future repatriated earnings. We have, in the past, hedged and may, in the future, hedge net investment \npositions in certain foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on these net investments.

For fiscal 2023, the \nnet change in working capital compared to the prior year was impacted by unfavorable changes in Accounts payable, offset by \nfavorable impacts from Inventories and Accounts receivable. These changes were, in part, due to reduced inventory purchases in \nthe current period and timing of wholesale shipments.

When the specific criteria to qualify for hedge accounting has been met, \nchanges in the fair value of contracts hedging probable forecasted future cash flows are recorded in Accumulated other \ncomprehensive income (loss), rather than Net income, until the underlying hedged transaction affects Net income. In most cases, \nthis results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into \nNet income sometime after the maturity of the derivative. One of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the notional \nvalue of these derivative contracts should not be in excess of the designated amount of anticipated transactions. By their very \nnature, our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions. When \nthe designated amount of anticipated or actual transactions decline below hedged levels, or if it is no longer probable a \nforecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two-month period of time \nthereafter, we reclassify the cumulative change in fair value of the over-hedged portion of the related hedge contract from \nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to Other (income) expense, net during the quarter in which the decrease \noccurs.

The income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in \nwhich they occur.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES \nABOUT MARKET RISK\nIn the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures, we employ a variety of financial \ninstruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates. It is our policy to utilize these \nfinancial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures; we do not enter into these \ntransactions for trading or speculative purposes.\nWe are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations, primarily as a result of our international sales, product sourcing and funding \nactivities. Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of \ncurrency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We use forward and option \ncontracts to hedge certain anticipated, but not yet firmly committed, transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the \nrelated receivables and payables, including third-party and intercompany transactions. Where exposures are hedged, our \nprogram has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe timing for hedging exposures, as well as the type and duration of the hedge instruments employed, are guided by our \nhedging policies and determined based upon the nature of the exposure and prevailing market conditions. Typically, the \nCompany may enter into hedge contracts starting 12 to 24 months in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place \nincremental hedges up to 100% of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs. The majority of derivatives \noutstanding as of May 31, 2023, are designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges, primarily for Euro/U.S. Dollar, British \nPound/Euro, Chinese Yuan/U.S. Dollar, and Japanese Yen/U.S. Dollar currency pairs. Refer to Note 12 — Risk Management and \nDerivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nOur earnings are also exposed to movements in short- and long-term market interest rates. Our objective in managing this \ninterest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing \ncosts. To achieve these objectives, we maintain a mix of commercial paper, bank loans, and fixed-rate debt of varying maturities.\nMARKET RISK MEASUREMENT\nWe monitor foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of \nmarket value, sensitivity analysis and Value-at-Risk (\"VaR\").

The VaR determines the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate-\nsensitive financial instruments. The VaR model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. There \nare various modeling techniques that can be used in the VaR computation. Our computations are based on interrelationships \nbetween currencies and interest rates (a \"variance/co-variance\" technique). These interrelationships are a function of foreign \nexchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one-year period. The value of foreign currency \noptions does not change on a one-to-one basis with changes in the underlying currency rate. We adjust the potential loss in \noption value for the estimated sensitivity (the \"delta\" and \"gamma\") to changes in the underlying currency rate. This calculation \nreflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only and does not include the impact of such \nrate fluctuations on non-functional currency transactions (such as anticipated transactions, firm commitments, cash balances and \naccounts and loans receivable and payable), including those which are hedged by these instruments.\nThe VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value we will incur nor does it \nconsider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates. It also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss \nthat may occur. Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates \nand interrelationships, hedging instruments and hedge percentages, timing and other factors.\nThe estimated maximum one-day loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments, derived \nusing the VaR model, was $111 million and $99 million as of May 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The VaR increased year-over-\nyear as a result of an increase in foreign currency volatilities as of May 31, 2023. Such a hypothetical loss in the fair value of our \nderivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged.

Also \nin our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, \n2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control \nover financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the \naccompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express \nopinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting \nbased on our audits.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that \n(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions \nof the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit \npreparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and \nexpenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the \ncompany; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or \ndisposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.

As disclosed \nby management, the use of significant judgment and estimates, as well as the interpretation and application of complex tax laws \nis required by management to determine the Company's provision for income taxes.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the accounting for income taxes is a \ncritical audit matter are a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit \nevidence relating to management's assessment of complex tax laws and regulations as it relates to determining the provision for \nincome taxes.

In some markets outside the U.S., these trademarks are licensed \nto third parties who design, distribute, market and sell similar products. Operating results of the Converse brand are reported on a \nstand-alone basis.\nBASIS OF CONSOLIDATION\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of NIKE, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the \"Company\" or \"NIKE\"). All \nsignificant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. \nREVENUE RECOGNITION\nRevenue transactions associated with the sale of NIKE Brand footwear, apparel and equipment, as well as Converse products, \ncomprise a single performance obligation, which consists of the sale of products to customers either through wholesale or direct \nto consumer channels. The Company satisfies the performance obligation and records revenues when transfer of control to the \ncustomer has occurred, based on the terms of sale. A customer is considered to have control once they are able to direct the use \nand receive substantially all of the benefits of the product. \nControl is transferred to wholesale customers upon shipment or upon receipt depending on the country of the sale and the \nagreement with the customer. Control transfers to retail store customers at the time of sale and to substantially all digital \ncommerce customers upon shipment. The transaction price is determined based upon the invoiced sales price, less anticipated \nsales returns, discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers. Payment terms for wholesale transactions depend on the \ncountry of sale or agreement with the customer and payment is generally required within 90 days or less of shipment to or receipt \nby the wholesale customer. Payment is due at the time of sale for retail store and digital commerce transactions.\nConsideration for trademark licensing contracts is earned through sales-based or usage-based royalty arrangements, and the \nassociated revenues are recognized over the license period. \nTaxes assessed by governmental authorities that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing \ntransaction, and are collected by the Company from a customer, are excluded from Revenues and Cost of sales in the \nConsolidated Statements of Income. Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product \nhas transferred to a customer are accounted for as fulfillment costs and are included in Cost of sales when the related revenues \nare recognized.\nSALES-RELATED RESERVES\nConsideration promised in the Company's contracts with customers is variable due to anticipated reductions, such as sales \nreturns, discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers.

The Company makes ongoing estimates relating to \nthe collectability of its accounts receivable and maintains an allowance for expected losses resulting from the inability of its \ncustomers to make required payments. In addition to judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on \nongoing credit evaluations, the Company considers historical levels of credit losses, as well as macroeconomic and industry \ntrends to determine the amount of the allowance.

Factors that would necessitate an \nimpairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant \nadverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the \nobservable market value of an asset, among others. If such facts indicate a potential impairment, the Company would assess the \nrecoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected \nundiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life \nof the primary asset in the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not \nrecoverable, the Company will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies, which would \ntypically include an estimate of discounted cash flows.

If the carrying value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, the goodwill of \nthat reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is determined to be impaired and the Company will record an impairment \ncharge equal to the excess of the carrying value over the related fair value. \nThere were no accumulated impairment losses as of May 31, 2023 and 2022. Additionally, the impact to Goodwill as a result of \nacquisitions and divestitures during fiscal 2023 and 2022, was not material.\nOPERATING LEASES\nThe Company primarily leases retail store space, certain distribution and warehouse facilities, office space, equipment and other \nnon-real estate assets. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception and begins recording lease activity at \nthe commencement date, which is generally the date in which the Company takes possession of or controls the physical use of \nthe asset.

Right-of-use (\"ROU\") assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the \nlease term with lease expense recognized on a straight-line basis. The Company's incremental borrowing rate is used to \ndetermine the present value of future lease payments unless the implicit rate is readily determinable. \nLease agreements may contain rent escalation clauses, renewal or termination options, rent holidays or certain landlord \nincentives, including tenant improvement allowances. ROU assets include amounts for scheduled rent increases and are reduced \nby the amount of lease incentives. The lease term includes the non-cancelable period of the lease and options to extend or \nterminate the lease when it is reasonably certain the Company will exercise those options. The Company does not record leases \nwith an initial term of 12 months or less on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and recognizes related lease payments in the \nConsolidated Statements of Income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Fair value is the price the Company would receive to sell an asset or pay to \ntransfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date. The Company uses a three-level \nhierarchy that prioritizes fair value measurements based on the types of inputs used, as follows:\nNIKE, INC.      \n64\n\n\n• Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n• Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; these include \nquoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in \nmarkets that are not active.\n• Level 3: Unobservable inputs with little or no market data available, which require the reporting entity to develop its own \nassumptions.\nThe Company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires \njudgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based \non the most conservative level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nPricing vendors are utilized for a majority of Level 1 and Level 2 investments. These vendors either provide a quoted market price \nin an active market or use observable inputs without applying significant adjustments in their pricing. Observable inputs include \nbroker quotes, interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, volatilities and credit risks. The fair value \nof derivative contracts is determined using observable market inputs such as the daily market foreign currency rates, forward \npricing curves, currency volatilities, currency correlations and interest rates and considers nonperformance risk of the Company \nand its counterparties. \nThe Company's fair value measurement process includes comparing fair values to another independent pricing vendor to ensure \nappropriate fair values are recorded.\nRefer to Note 4 — Fair Value Measurements for additional information.\nFOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS\nAdjustments resulting from translating foreign functional currency financial statements into U.S. Dollars are included in the foreign \ncurrency translation adjustment, a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\nThe Company's global subsidiaries have various monetary assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, which are \ndenominated in currencies other than their functional currency.

For undesignated hedges and designated cash flow hedges, \nthis is primarily within the Cash provided by operations component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. For \ndesignated net investment hedges, this is within the Cash provided by investing activities component of the Consolidated \nStatements of Cash Flows. For the Company's fair value hedges, which are interest rate swaps used to mitigate the change in \nfair value of its fixed-rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates, the related cash flows from periodic interest payments are \nreflected within the Cash provided by operations component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. \nRefer to Note 12 — Risk Management and Derivatives for additional information on the Company's risk management program \nand derivatives.\nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nThe Company accounts for stock-based compensation by estimating the fair value, net of estimated forfeitures, of equity awards \nand recognizing the related expense as Cost of sales or Operating overhead expense, as applicable, in the Consolidated \nStatements of Income on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.

The fair value of options, stock appreciation rights and employees' purchase \nrights under the employee stock purchase plans (\"ESPPs\") is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair \nvalue of restricted stock and time-vesting restricted stock units is established by the market price on the date of grant.

This approach requires the recognition of deferred \ntax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and \nthe tax basis of assets and liabilities. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount \nmanagement believes is more likely than not to be realized. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable \nearnings and is therefore uncertain. At least quarterly, the Company assesses taxable income in prior carryback periods, the \nscheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and available tax planning strategies. The Company \nuses forecasts of taxable income and considers foreign tax credit utilization in making this assessment of realization, which are \ninherently uncertain and can result in significant variation between estimated and actual results. To the extent the Company \nbelieves that recovery is not likely, a valuation allowance is established against the net deferred tax asset, which increases the \nCompany's income tax expense in the period when such determination is made.\nThe Company recognizes a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not \nthe position will be sustained upon examination by relevant tax authorities.

In January 2019, the \nEuropean Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether the Netherlands has breached State Aid rules when \ngranting certain tax rulings to the Company. The Company believes the investigation is without merit. If this matter is adversely \nresolved, the Netherlands may be required to assess additional amounts with respect to prior periods, and the Company's \nincome taxes related to prior periods in the Netherlands could increase. \nA portion of the Company's foreign operations benefit from a tax holiday, which is set to expire in 2031.

NTC sales to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency result in a foreign currency \n2023 FORM 10-K   79    \n\n\nexposure for the NTC. (2) Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars. These \npurchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar.\nThe Company's policy permits the utilization of derivatives to reduce its foreign currency exposures where internal netting or \nother strategies cannot be effectively employed. Typically, the Company may enter into hedge contracts starting up to 12 to 24 \nmonths in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental hedges up to 100% of the exposure by the time the \nforecasted transaction occurs. The total notional amount of outstanding foreign currency derivatives designated as cash flow \nhedges was $18.2 billion as of May 31, 2023.\nAs of May 31, 2023, approximately $419 million of deferred net gains (net of tax) on both outstanding and matured derivatives in \nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are expected to be reclassified to Net income during the next 12 months \nconcurrent with the underlying hedged transactions also being recorded in Net income. Actual amounts ultimately reclassified to \nNet income are dependent on the exchange rates in effect when derivative contracts currently outstanding mature. As of May 31, \n2023, the maximum term over which the Company hedges exposures to the variability of cash flows for its forecasted \ntransactions was 27 months.\nFAIR VALUE HEDGES\nThe Company has, in the past, been exposed to the risk of changes in the fair value of certain fixed-rate debt attri",

Derivatives used by the Company to hedge this risk are receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps. \nThe Company had no interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges as of May 31, 2023. \nNET INVESTMENT HEDGES\nThe Company has, in the past, hedged and may, in the future, hedge the risk of variability in foreign currency-denominated net \ninvestments in wholly-owned international operations. All changes in fair value of the derivatives designated as net investment \nhedges are reported in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) along with the foreign currency translation adjustments \non those investments. The Company had no outstanding net investment hedges as of May 31, 2023.\nUNDESIGNATED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS\nThe Company may elect to enter into foreign exchange forwards to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and \nliabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These undesignated instruments are recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or \nliability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with their corresponding change in fair value recognized in Other (income) expense, \nnet, together with the remeasurement gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position. The total notional amount of \noutstanding undesignated derivative instruments was $4.7 billion as of May 31, 2023.\nCREDIT RISK\nThe Company is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to hedging instruments. The \ncounterparties to all derivative transactions are major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings; however, this \ndoes not eliminate the Company's exposure to credit risk with these institutions. This credit risk is limited to the unrealized gains \nin such contracts should any of these counterparties fail to perform as contracted. To manage this risk, the Company has \nestablished strict counterparty credit guidelines that are continually monitored.\nThe Company's derivative contracts contain credit risk-related contingent features designed to protect against significant \ndeterioration in counterparties' creditworthiness and their ultimate ability to settle outstanding derivative contracts in the normal \ncourse of business. The Company's bilateral credit-related contingent features generally require the owing entity, either the \nCompany or the derivative counterparty, to post collateral for the portion of the fair value in excess of $50 million should the fair \nvalue of outstanding derivatives per counterparty be greater than $50 million. Additionally, a certain level of decline in credit rating \nof either the Company or the counterparty could trigger collateral requirements. As of May 31, 2023, the Company was in \ncompliance with all credit risk-related contingent features, and derivative instruments with such features were in a net liability \nposition of approximately $2 million.

However, we can infer that the information might be present in the \"Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" section of the fiscal 2022 Form 10-K, which is mentioned at the end of the excerpt.\n\nHowever, we can extract the relevant information from the provided excerpt. The excerpt mentions that NIKE, Inc. returned $7.5 billion to its shareholders in fiscal 2023 through share repurchases and dividends. This information can be categorized under financing activities.\n\nSince the excerpt does not provide explicit information on cash flow from operations and investing activities, we cannot extract the net cash flow figures for these categories.\n\nTherefore, the extracted information is:\n\n- Financing activities: $7.5 billion\n   Citation: We returned $7.5 billion to our shareholders in fiscal 2023 through share repurchases and dividends\n\n### Chunk # 50\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 51\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 52\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 53\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 54\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 55\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 56\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 57\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 58\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 59\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 60\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 61\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 62\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 63\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 64\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 65\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 66\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 67\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 68\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`68`):\n   Answer: The net cash flow figures for operating, investing, and financing activities are:\n\n- Operating activities: $5,841 million (inflow) for fiscal 2023, and $5,188 million (inflow) for fiscal 2022.\n- Investing activities: $564 million (inflow) for fiscal 2023, and -$1,524 million (outflow) for fiscal 2022.\n- Financing activities: -$7,447 million (outflow) for fiscal 202\n   Explanation: The net cash flow figures for operating, investing, and financing activities are:\n\n- Operating activities: $5,841 million (inflow) for fiscal 2023, and $5,188 million (inflow) for fiscal 2022.\n- Investing activities: $564 million (inflow) for fiscal 2023, and -$1,524 million (outflow) for fiscal 2022.\n- Financing activities: -$7,447 million (outflow) for fiscal 2023, and -$4,836 million (outflow) for fiscal 2022.\n\nMy reasoning for answering this task is to carefully read and identify the specific figures related to cash flow from operations, investing, and financing in the given document excerpt.\n   Citation: Cash provided (used) by operations was an inflow of $5,841 million for fiscal 2023, compared to $5,188 million for fiscal 2022. \nCash provided (used) by investing activities was an inflow of $564 million for fiscal 2023, compared to an outflow of $1,524 \nmillion for fiscal 2022, primarily driven by the net change in short-term investments. \nCash provided (used) by financing activities was an outflow of $7,447 million for fiscal 2023 compared to an outflow of $4,836 \nmillion for fiscal 2022.\n\n### Chunk # 69\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 70\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 71\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 72\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 73\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 74\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 75\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 76\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 77\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 78\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 79\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 80\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 81\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 82\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 83\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`83`):\n   Answer: The net cash flow figures for operating, investing, and financing activities are:\n\n- Operating activities: \n  -

      "output": "We have gathered several pieces of information regarding Nike's cash flow activities for FY2023. The key figures extracted are:\n\n1. **Operating Activities**: There are conflicting figures of $5,841 million and $6,421 million. However, a reliable citation from chunk #68 suggests an inflow of $5,841 million.\n2. **Investing Activities**: Consistently reported as a $564 million inflow.\n3. **Financing Activities**: Conflicting figures of $7,447 million and $1,044 million. The reliable citation from chunk #68 indicates a $7,447 million outflow.\n\nTo answer the question of which activity brought in the most or lost the least cash flow, we need to determine the net cash flow for each activity:\n\n- **Operating Activities**: $5,841 million inflow (based on the reliable citation).\n- **Investing Activities**: $564 million inflow.\n- **Financing Activities**: $7,447 million outflow (based on the reliable citation).\n\nThe information is sufficient to answer the question. Among the three activities, **operating activities** brought in the most cash flow with an inflow of $5,841 million. Investing activities also had an inflow but significantly less at $564 million. Financing activities resulted in an outflow, thus losing cash.\n\nIn conclusion, operating activities were the most beneficial in terms of cash flow for Nike in FY2023."
