Answer in units of percents and round to one decimal place. Approach the question asked by assuming the standpoint of an investment banking analyst who only has access to the statement of income.\n\n---\n\nPlease provide succinct advice on the critical information we need to extract from the Financial document. Total length: 541469 characters to answer this question. \n\nAlso consider the following constraints:\n- In your response do NOT use numbered lists.\n- Do NOT structure your response as a sequence of steps.\n",
      "output": "To determine the FY2019 - FY2020 total revenue growth rate for Block (formerly known as Square), focus on extracting the total revenue figures for both fiscal years from the statement of income. These figures are typically found in the revenue section of the income statement, often labeled as \"Total Revenue\" or \"Net Revenue.\" Once you have these numbers, calculate the growth rate by subtracting the FY2019 revenue from the FY2020 revenue, dividing the result by the FY2019 revenue, and then multiplying by 100 to convert it to a percentage. Round the final result to one decimal place to meet the specified requirement. This approach will provide the necessary insight into the company's revenue growth over the specified period."

Instead, you can assign small, isolated tasks to a less capable worker model that sees only a single chunk of text at a time. Any cross-chunk or multi-document reasoning must be handled by you.\n\n## Your Job: Write Two Python Functions\n\n### FUNCTION #1: `prepare_jobs(context, prev_job_manifests, prev_job_outputs) -> List[JobManifest]`\n- Break the document(s) into chunks (using the provided chunking function, if needed). Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 12 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`. All **multi-chunk integration** or **global reasoning** is your responsibility here.\n- Return one **aggregated string** suitable for further supervisor inspection.\n\n\n\n## Relevant Pydantic Models\n\nThe following models are already in the global scope. **Do NOT redefine or re-import them.**\n\n### JobManifest Model\n```\nclass JobManifest(BaseModel):\n    chunk: str  # the actual text for the chunk of the document\n    task: str  # the actual task instruction for the small model\n    advice: str  # optional, any additional advice on how to perform the task\n\n    chunk_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    task_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    job_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n\n```\n\n### JobOutput Model\n```\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    citation: Optional[str]\n    answer: Optional[str]\n\n```\n\n## Function Signatures\n```\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        context (List[str]): A list of documents.

BUSINESS\nOur Business\nWe started Square in February 2009 to enable businesses (sellers) to accept card payments, an important capability that was previously inaccessible to\nmany businesses. As our company grew, we recognized that sellers need a variety of solutions to thrive and saw how we could apply our strength in technology\nand innovation to help sellers. We have since expanded to provide more than 30 distinct products and services to sellers that help them manage and grow their\nbusiness. Similarly, with Cash App, we have built a parallel ecosystem of financial services to help individuals manage their money. Our purpose of economic\nempowerment drives the development of all our products and services. Effective June 30, 2020, we changed the way we reported our results from one operating\nand reportable segment to two. Our two reportable segments are Seller and Cash App, reflecting our two ecosystems and the way management and our chief\noperating decision maker (“CODM”) review and assess the performance of our business.\nSeller Ecosystem: Square offers a cohesive commerce ecosystem that helps our sellers start, run, and grow their businesses. We combine software,\nhardware, and financial services to create products and services that are cohesive, fast, self-serve, and elegant. These attributes differentiate Square in a fragmented\nindustry that traditionally forces sellers to stitch together products and services from multiple vendors, and more often than not, rely on inefficient non-digital\nprocesses and tools. Our ability to add new sellers efficiently, help them grow their business, and cross-sell products and services has historically led to continued\nand sustained long-term growth. In the year ended December 31, 2020, we processed $103.7 billion of Seller Gross Payment Volume (GPV), which was generated\nby more than 2 billion card payments from 405 million payment cards. At the end of 2020, our Square point of sale ecosystem had over 210 million buyer profiles\nand approximately 295 million items were listed on Square by sellers.\nCash App Ecosystem: Cash App provides an ecosystem of financial products and services to help individuals manage their money. Cash App’s goal is to\nredefine the w",

These  forward-looking  statements  are  subject  to  numerous  risks  and\nuncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described under “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

      "output": "We have gathered multiple pieces of information regarding the total revenue for Block (formerly known as Square) for FY2019 and FY2020. The extracted data includes:\n\n1. FY2019: $39,319 thousand and $4,713,500\n2. FY2020: $123,919 and $9,497,578\n\nThere are conflicting figures for both FY2019 and FY2020. The figures $39,319 thousand and $123,919 seem to be in thousands, which would translate to $39,319,000 and $123,919,000 respectively. However, the other figures $4,713,500 and $9,497,578 are not in thousands and appear to be more consistent with typical revenue figures for a company like Block.\n\nTo determine the total revenue growth rate, we need consistent and accurate revenue figures for both fiscal years. Given the conflicting data, we should rely on the figures that appear more credible and consistent with typical financial reporting. The figures $4,713,500 for FY2019 and $9,497,578 for FY2020 seem more plausible.\n\nAssuming these figures are correct, we can calculate the growth rate as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Growth Rate} = \\left(\\frac{\\text{FY2020 Revenue} - \\text{FY2019 Revenue}}{\\text{FY2019 Revenue}}\\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Growth Rate} = \\left(\\frac{9,497,578 - 4,713,500}{4,713,500}\\right) \\times 100 \\approx 101.4\\%\n\\]\n\nThus, the total revenue growth rate from FY2019 to FY2020 is approximately 101.4%."
