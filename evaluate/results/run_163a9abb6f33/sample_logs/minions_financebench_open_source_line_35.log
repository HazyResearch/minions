--- Question ---
What drove operating margin change as of the FY22 for AMD? If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then please state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
The operating margin for AMD decreased from $3,648 million in FY21 to $1,264 million in FY22. This decline was driven by increased costs of goods sold due to amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, higher operating expenses from R&D and marketing, and one-time charges related to acquisitions. Revenue growth in the Data Center and Gaming segments was offset by a decline in the Client segment, influenced by weak PC market conditions. Competitive pressures and macroeconomic factors also contributed to the margin decrease.

--- Ground Truth ---
["The decrease in AMD's operating income was primarily driven by amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition"]

--- Correctness Evaluation ---
Is correct: True
Confidence: 0.90
Reasoning: The predicted answer correctly identifies the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles as a key driver of the decrease in AMD's operating margin, which aligns with the ground truth. Additionally, it provides further context about increased costs, higher operating expenses, and market conditions, which are reasonable factors that could contribute to the margin change. The additional details do not contradict the ground truth and provide a more comprehensive explanation.
