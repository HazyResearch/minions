What drove operating margin change as of the FY22 for AMD? If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then please state that and explain why.

The operating margin decreased from 22.2% in 2021 to 5.4% in 2022, mainly due to the amortization of intangible assets from the Xilinx acquisition and increased operating expenses.

--- Ground Truth ---
["The decrease in AMD's operating income was primarily driven by amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition"]
