  "ground_truth": [
    "Operating Margin for 3M in FY2022 has decreased by 1.7% primarily due to: \n-Decrease in gross Margin\n-mostly one-off charges including Combat Arms Earplugs litigation, impairment related to exiting PFAS manufacturing, costs related to exiting Russia and divestiture-related restructuring\ncharges"

  "correctness_reasoning": "The predicted answer correctly identifies significant litigation costs as a driver of the operating margin change, which aligns with the ground truth. However, it does not mention the decrease in gross margin or the specific one-off charges related to Combat Arms Earplugs litigation, PFAS manufacturing exit, Russia exit, and divestiture-related restructuring charges. Instead, it includes foreign currency impacts, increased raw materials and logistics costs, and changes in segment performance measures, which are not mentioned in the ground truth. Therefore, the key facts and conclusions do not fully align."
