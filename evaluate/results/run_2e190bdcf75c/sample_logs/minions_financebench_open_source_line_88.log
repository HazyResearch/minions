--- Question ---
Roughly how many times has JnJ sold its inventory in FY2022? Calculate inventory turnover ratio for FY2022; if conventional inventory management is not meaningful for the company then state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
The inventory turnover ratio for J&J in FY2022 cannot be calculated accurately due to missing average inventory data. However, the COGS is $31,089 million. Conventional inventory management may not be meaningful for J&J due to its complex business model, global supply chain, reliance on third-party manufacturers, and various external factors such as currency fluctuations and supply constraints.

--- Ground Truth ---
['JnJ sold its inventory 2.7 times in FY2022.']
