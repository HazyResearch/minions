--- Question ---
Does Corning have positive working capital based on FY2022 data? If working capital is not a useful or relevant metric for this company, then please state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
Corning has positive working capital of $2,278 million for FY2022.

--- Ground Truth ---
['Yes. Corning had a positive working capital amount of $831 million by FY 2022 close. This answer considers only operating current assets and current liabilities that were clearly shown in the balance sheet.']

--- Correctness Evaluation ---
Is correct: False
Confidence: 0.80
Reasoning: The predicted answer states that Corning has positive working capital of $2,278 million for FY2022, which does not fall within the 10% tolerance range of the ground truth answer of $831 million (which would be $747.9 million to $914.1 million). Therefore, the numerical value does not match the ground truth, and the stance on the working capital amount is incorrect.
