  "question": "Does AMEX have an improving operating margin profile as of 2022? If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then state that and explain why.",
  "predicted_answer": "The document does not provide sufficient information to confirm whether AMEX has an improving operating margin profile as of 2022. The operating margin is estimated to be around 18%, but this is not confirmed by the document. Additionally, the relevance of operating margin as a metric for AMEX is debated, with some suggesting it is relevant for profitability and others arguing it may not be due to AMEX's business model. Alternative metrics like net interest margin, return on equity, or efficiency ratio are not consistently mentioned, indicating that operating margin might not be the most useful metric for AMEX.",
