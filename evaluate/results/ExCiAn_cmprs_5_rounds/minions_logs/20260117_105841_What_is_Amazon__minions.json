      "output": "To determine Amazon's FY2017 days payable outstanding (DPO), focus on extracting specific financial data from the balance sheet and the profit and loss (P&L) statement. You need the accounts payable figures for both FY2016 and FY2017 to calculate the average accounts payable. Additionally, obtain the cost of goods sold (COGS) for FY2017 from the P&L statement. The change in inventory requires the inventory figures for both FY2016 and FY2017 from the balance sheet. With these figures, you can compute the DPO using the formula provided. Ensure all values are accurately extracted and calculations are precise, rounding the final DPO to two decimal places."

Instead, you can assign small, isolated tasks to a less capable worker model that sees only a single chunk of text at a time. Any cross-chunk or multi-document reasoning must be handled by you.\n\n## Your Job: Write Two Python Functions\n\n### FUNCTION #1: `prepare_jobs(context, prev_job_manifests, prev_job_outputs) -> List[JobManifest]`\n- Break the document(s) into chunks (using the provided chunking function, if needed). Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 12 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`. All **multi-chunk integration** or **global reasoning** is your responsibility here.\n- Return one **aggregated string** suitable for further supervisor inspection.\n\n\n\n## Relevant Pydantic Models\n\nThe following models are already in the global scope. **Do NOT redefine or re-import them.**\n\n### JobManifest Model\n```\nclass JobManifest(BaseModel):\n    chunk: str  # the actual text for the chunk of the document\n    task: str  # the actual task instruction for the small model\n    advice: str  # optional, any additional advice on how to perform the task\n\n    chunk_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    task_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    job_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n\n```\n\n### JobOutput Model\n```\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    citation: Optional[str]\n    answer: Optional[str]\n\n```\n\n## Function Signatures\n```\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        context (List[str]): A list of documents.

On March 23, 2017, the U.S. Tax Court issued its decision\nregarding the issues raised in the IRS NOPAs. The Tax Court rejected the approach from the IRS NOPAs in determining transfer pricing adjustments in 2005 and\n2006 for the transactions undertaken with our foreign subsidiaries and adopted, with adjustments, our suggested approach. On September 29, 2017, the IRS filed a\nnotice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. We will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. If the Tax Court decision were\nreversed on appeal or if the IRS were to successfully assert transfer pricing adjustments of a similar nature to the NOPAs for transactions in subsequent years, we\ncould be subject to significant additional tax liabilities. In addition, in October 2014, the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether\ndecisions by the tax authorities in Luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on\nstate aid. On October 4, 2017, the European Commission announced its decision that determinations by the tax authorities in Luxembourg did not comply with\nEuropean Union rules on state aid.

The following is a reconciliation of free cash\nflow to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” for 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 (in millions):\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2015\n2016\n2017\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n$\n12,039\n$\n17,272\n$\n18,434\nPurchases of property and equipment, including internal-use software and website development, net\nof proceeds from property and equipment incentives\n(4,589)\n(6,737)\n(10,058)\nFree cash flow\n$\n7,450\n$\n10,535\n$\n8,376\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n$\n(6,450)\n$\n(9,876)\n$\n(27,819)\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n$\n(",

Our long-term debt is carried at\namortized cost and fluctuations in interest rates do not impact our consolidated financial statements. However, the fair value of our debt, which pays interest at a\nfixed rate, will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates\nof interest.

These capitalized costs are amortized to “Cost of sales” on an accelerated basis that follows the viewing pattern of customer streams in the\nfirst months after availability.\nInvestments\nWe generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities and AAA-rated money market funds. Such\ninvestments are included in “Cash and cash equivalents” or “Marketable securities” on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Marketable securities are\nclassified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss.”\nEquity investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting if the investment gives us the ability to exercise significant influence, but not\ncontrol, over an investee. Equity-method investments are included within “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets. Our share of the earnings or losses as\nreported by equity-method investees, amortization of basis differences, and related gains or losses, if any, are classified as “Equity - method investment activity,\nnet of tax” on our consolidated statements of operations.\nEquity investments without readily determinable fair values and for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for using\nthe cost method of accounting and classified as “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets. Under the cost method, investments are carried at cost and are\nadjusted only for other-than-temporary declines in fair value, certain distributions, and additional investments.\nEquity investments that have readily determinable fair values are classified as available-for-sale and are included in “Marketable securities” on our\nconsolidated balance sheets and are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, included in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss.”\nWe periodically evaluate whether declines in fair values of our investments below their book value are other-than-temporary. This evaluation consists of\nseveral qualitative and quantitative factors regarding the severity and duration of the unrealized loss as well as our ability and intent to hold the investment until a\nforecasted recovery occurs. Additionally, we assess whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell any\ninvestment before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Factors considered include quoted market prices; recent financial results and operating trends; implied\nvalues from any recent transactions or offers of investee securities; credit quality of debt instrument issuers; other publicly available information that may affect the\nvalue",

On September 29, 2017, the IRS filed a notice of\nappeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. We will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. If the Tax Court decision were reversed\non appeal or if the IRS were to successfully assert transfer pricing adjustments of a similar nature to the NOPAs for transactions in subsequent years, we could be\nsubject to significant additional tax liabilities.\nCertain of our subsidiaries were under examination or investigation by the French Tax Administration (“FTA”) for calendar year 2006 and thereafter. In\nSeptember 2012, we received proposed tax assessment notices for calendar years 2006 through 2010 relating to the allocation of income between foreign\njurisdictions. In June 2015, we rec",

In addition, in October 2014, the\nEuropean Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in Luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax\npaid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid.

Question to answer:\nWhat is Amazon's FY2017 days payable outstanding (DPO)? DPO is defined as: 365 * (average accounts payable between FY2016 and FY2017) / (FY2017 COGS + change in inventory between FY2016 and FY2017). Round your answer to two decimal places. Address the question by using the line items and information shown within the balance sheet and the P&L statement.\n\n2. Collected Job Outputs (from junior models):\nAccounts Payable Data:\n$173,760 (Source: )\n$180 million (Source: \"As a measure of sensitivity, for every 1% of additional inventory valuation allowance as of December 31, 2017, we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of approximately $180 million.\")\nTo extract the cost of goods sold (COGS) for FY2017, I will look for sections in the provided document that mention COGS or related terms such as gross profit or gross margin.

The aggregation includes all relevant information from the job outputs, such as answers, explanations, and citations."

This ensures that each `chunk` in the `JobManifest` is a string, not a list.\n\n- **Job Manifest Creation**: Each `JobManifest` is created with a single string chunk, which resolves the validation error."

We are guided by four\nprinciples: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. In each of our\nsegments, we serve our primary customer sets, consisting of consumers, sellers, developers, enterprises, and content creators. In addition, we provide services, such\nas advertising services and co-branded credit card agreements.\nWe have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and Amazon Web Services (“AWS”).

If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows\ncould be materially adversely affected. In addition, the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks.\nWe Face Intense Competition\nOur businesses are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive, and we have many competitors in different industries, including retail, e-commerce services,\ndigital content and electronic devices, and web and infrastructure computing services. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longer\nhistories, more customers, and/or greater brand recognition, particularly with our newly-launched products and services and in our newer geographic regions. They\nmay secure better terms from vendors, adopt more aggressive pricing, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing.\nCompetition may intensify, including with the development of new business models and the entry of new and well-funded competitors, and as our\ncompetitors enter into business combinations or alliances and established companies in other market segments expand to become competitive with our business. In\naddition, new and enhanced technologies, including search, web and infrastructure computing services, digital content, and electronic devices, may increase our\ncompetition. The Internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping, and increased competition may reduce our sales and profits.\nOur Expansion Places a Significant Strain on our Management, Operational, Financial, and Other Resources\nWe are rapidly and significantly expanding our global operations, including increasing our product and service offerings and scaling our infrastructure to\nsupport our retail and services businesses. This expansion increases the complexity of our business and places significant strain on our management, personnel,\noperations, systems, technical performance, financial resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions. We may not be able to manage growth\neffectively, which could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results.\nOur Expansion into New Products, Services, Technologies, and Geographic Regions Subjects Us to Additional Business, Legal, Financial, and Competitive\nRisks\nWe may have limited or no experience in our newer market segments, and our customers may not adopt our new offerings.

If any of this were to occur, it could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating\nresults.\nWe May Experience Significant Fluctuations in Our Operating Results and Growth Rate\nWe may not be able to accurately forecast our growth rate. We base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates. A significant portion of our\nexpenses and investments is fixed, and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected.\nOur revenue growth may not be sustainable, and our percentage growth rates may decrease.

In certain international market segments,\nwe have relatively little operating experience and may not benefit from any first-to-market advantages or otherwise succeed. It is costly to establish, develop, and\nmaintain international operations and websites, and promote our brand internationally. Our international operations may not be profitable on a sustained basis.\nIn addition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks, including:\n•\nlocal economic and political conditions;\n•\ngovernment regulation of e-commerce and other services, electronic devices, and competition, and restrictive governmental actions (such as trade\nprotection measures, including export duties and quotas and custom duties and tariffs), nationalization, and restrictions on foreign ownership;\n•\nrestrictions on sales or distribution of certain products or services and uncertainty regarding liability for products, services, and content, including\nuncertainty as a result of less Internet-friendly legal systems, local laws, lack of legal precedent, and varying rules, regulations, and practices regarding\nthe physical and digital distribution of media products and enforcement of intellectual property rights;\n•\nbusiness licensing or certification requirements, such as for imports, exports, web services, and electronic devices;\n•\nlimitations on the repatriation and investment of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions;\n•\nlimited fulfillment and technology infrastructure;\n•\nshorter payable and longer receivable cycles and the resultant negative impact on cash flow;\n•\nlaws and regulations regarding consumer and data protection, privacy, network security, encryption, payments, and restrictions on pricing or discounts;\n•\nlower levels of use of the Internet;\n•\nlower levels of consumer spending and fewer opportunities for growth compared to the U.S.;\n•\nlower levels of credit card usage and increased payment risk;\n•\ndifficulty in staffing, developing, and managing foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural differences;\n•\ndifferent employee/employer relationships and the existence of works councils and labor unions;\n7\n\n\nTable of Contents",

We may not be able to\nhire, train, retain, and manage required personnel, which may limit our international growth.\nThe People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) and India regulate Amazon’s and its affiliates’ businesses and operations in country through regulations and license\nrequirements that may restrict (i) foreign investment in and operation of the Internet, IT infrastructure, data centers, retail, delivery, and other sectors, (ii) Internet\ncontent, and (iii) the sale of media and other products and services. For example, in order to meet local ownership and regulatory licensing requirements,\nwww.amazon.cn is operated by PRC companies that are indirectly owned, either wholly or partially, by PRC nationals. In addition, we provide certain technology\nservices in China in conjunction with third parties that hold PRC licenses to provide services. In India, the government restricts the ownership or control of Indian\ncompanies by foreign entities involved in online multi-brand retail trading activities. For www.amazon.in, we provide certain marketing tools and logistics services\nto third-party sellers to enable them to sell online and deliver to customers, and we hold indirect minority interests in entities that are third-party sellers on the\nwww.amazon.in marketplace. Although we believe these structures and activities comply with existing laws, they involve unique risks, and the PRC is actively\nconsidering changes in its foreign investment rules that could impact these structures and activities. There are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation\nof PRC and Indian laws and regulations, and it is possible that these governments will ultimately take a view contrary to ours. In addition, our Chinese and Indian\nbusinesses and operations may be unable to continue to operate if we or our affiliates are unable to access sufficient funding or in China enforce contractual\nrelationships with respect to management and control of such businesses. If our international activities were found to be in violation of any existing or future PRC,\nIndian or other laws or regulations or if interpretations of those laws and regulations were to change, our businesses in those countries could be subject to fines and\nother financial penalties, have licenses revoked, or be forced to shut down entirely.\nIf We Do Not Successful",

As we\ncontinue to add fulfillment and data center capability or add new businesses with different requirements, our fulfillment and data center networks become\nincreasingly complex and operating them becomes more challenging. There can be no assurance that we will be able to operate our networks effectively.\nIn addition, a failure to optimize inventory in our fulfillment network will increase our net shipping cost by requiring long-zone or partial shipments.

If the other businesses on whose behalf we perform\ninventory fulfillment services deliver product to our fulfillment centers in excess of forecasts, we may be unable to secure sufficient storage space and may be\nunable to optimize our fulfillment network.\nWe rely on a limited number of shipping companies to deliver inventory to us and completed orders to our customers.

Any of these events could damage our reputation and be\nexpensive to remedy.\nWe Face Significant Inventory Risk\nIn addition to risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A relating to fulfillment network and inventory optimization by us and third parties, we are exposed to\nsignificant inventory risks that may adversely affect our operating results as a result of seasonality, new product launches, rapid changes in product cycles and\npricing, defective merchandise, changes in consumer demand and consumer spending patterns, changes in consumer tastes with respect to our products, spoilage,\nand other factors. We endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking products we manufacture and/or sell. Demand for\nproducts, however, can change significantly between the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of sale. In addition, when we begin selling or\nmanufacturing a new product, it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships, determine appropriate product or component selection, and accurately forecast\ndemand. The acquisition of certain types of inventory or components may require significant lead-time and prepayment and they may not be returnable. We carry a\nbroad selection and significant inventory levels of certain products, such as consumer electronics, and we may be unable to sell products in sufficient quantit",

We may not have sufficient lead time to build systems and processes to collect these taxes properly,\nor at all. Failure to comply with such laws or administrative practices, or a successful assertion by such states or foreign jurisdictions requiring us to collect taxes\nwhere we do not, could result in substantial tax liabilities, including for past sales, as well as penalties and interest. In addition, if the tax authorities in jurisdictions\nwhere we are already subject to sales tax or other indirect tax obligations were successfully to challenge our positions, our tax liability could increase substantially.\nIn the U.S., although Supreme Court decisions restrict states’ rights to require remote sellers to collect state and local sales taxes, the Supreme Court has recently\nagreed to hear a case that could overturn prior precedent. We support a federal law that would allow states to require sales tax collection by remote sellers under a\nnationwide system.\nWe are also subject to U.S. (federal and state) and foreign laws, regulations, and administrative practices that require us to collect information from our\ncustomers, vendors, merchants, and other third parties for tax reporting purposes and report such information to various government agencies. The scope of such\nrequirements continues to expand, requiring us to develop and implement new compliance systems. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result\nin significant penalties.\nWe Could Be Subject to Additional Income Tax Liabilities\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, and administrative practices in\nvarious jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, with or without notice, due to economic, political, and other conditions, and significant judgment is\nrequired in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes.

In addition, a number of countries are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, such as the recently\nenacted U.S. tax reform legislation commonly referred to as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “2017 Tax Act”). Finally, foreign governments may enact\ntax laws in response to the 2017 Tax Act that could result in further changes to global taxation and materially affect our financial position and results of operations.\nThe 2017 Tax Act significantly changes how the U.S. taxes corporations. The 2017 Tax Act requires complex computations to be performed that were not\npreviously required in U.S. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the 2017 Tax Act and significant estimates in\ncalculations, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. The U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other\nstandard-setting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the 2017 Tax Act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our\ninterpretation. As we complete our analysis of the 2017 Tax Act, collect and prepare necessary data, and interpret any additional guidance, we may make\nadjustments to provisional amounts that we have recorded that may materially impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are\nmade.\nWe are also currently subject to audit in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us. Developments in\nan audit, litigation, or the relevant laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations could have a material effect on our operating results or\ncash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. For instance, we have received Notices of\nProposed Adjustment (“NOPAs”) from the IRS for transactions undertaken in the 2005 and 2006 calendar years relating to transfer pricing with our foreign\nsubsidiaries and we have been contesting the matter in U.S. Tax Court. On March 23, 2017, the U.S. Tax Court issued its decision regarding the issues raised in the\nIRS NOPAs. The Tax Court rejected the approach from the IRS NOPAs in determining transfer pricing adjustments in 2005 and 2006 for the transactions\nundertaken with our foreign subsidiaries a",

On September 29, 2017, the IRS filed a notice of appeal to the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. We will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. If the Tax Court decision were reversed on appeal or if\nthe IRS were to successfully assert transfer pricing adjustments of a similar nature to the NOPAs for transactions in subsequent years, we could be subject to\nsignificant additional tax liabilities. In addition, in October 2014, the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax\nauthorities in Luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid. On October\n4, 2017, the European Commission announced its decision that determinations by the tax authorities in Luxembourg did not comply with European Union rules on\nstate aid. This decision orders Luxembourg to calculate and recover additional taxes from us for the period May 2006 through June 2014. We believe this decision\nto be without merit and will consider our legal options, including an appeal. In December 2017, Luxembourg appealed the European Commission’s decision.\nWhile the European Commission announced an estimated recovery amount of approximately €250 million, plus interest, the actual amount of additional taxes\nsubject to recovery is to be calculated by the Luxembourg tax authorities in accordance with the European Commission’s guidance. Although we believe our tax\nestimates are reasonable, the final outcome of tax audits, investigations, and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax\nprovisions and accruals.\nOur Supplier Relationships Subject Us to a Number of Risks\nWe have significant suppliers, including licensors, and in some cases, limited or single-sources of supply, that are important to our sourcing, services,\nmanufacturing, and any related ongoing servicing of merchandise and content. We do not have long-term arrangements with most of our suppliers to guarantee\navailability of merchandise, content, components, or services, particular payment terms, or the extension of credit limits.

In addition, if our suppliers or other vendors violate applicable laws, regulations, our code of\nstandards and responsibilities, or implement practices regarded as unethical, unsafe, or hazardous to the environment, it could damage our reputation, limit our\ngrowth, and negatively affect our operating results.\n13\n\n\nTable of ",

We may be subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts, and any\nviolations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contract, refunding or suspending of payments,\nforfeiture of profits, payment of fines, and suspension or debarment from future government business. In addition, such contracts may provide for termination by\nthe government at any time, without cause.\nWe May Be Subject to Product Liability Claims if People or Property Are Harmed by the Products We Sell or Manufacture\nSome of the products we sell or manufacture may expose us to product liability or food safety claims relating to personal injury or illness, death, or\nenvironmental or property damage, and may require product recalls or other actions. Certain third parties also sell products using our e-commerce services that\nmay increase our exposure to product liability claims, such as if these sellers do not have sufficient protection from such claims. Although we maintain liability\ninsurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on\neconomically reasonable terms, or at all.

The products offered through our consumer-facing\nwebsites and physical stores primarily include merchandise and content we have purchased for resale from vendors and products offered by third-party sellers, and\nwe also manufacture and sell electronic devices. Generally, we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory as product sales and recognize our\nnet share of revenue of items sold by third-party sellers as service sales. We seek to increase unit sales across our businesses, through increased product selection,\nacross numerous product categories. We also offer other services such as compute, storage, and database offerings, fulfillment, publishing, certain digital content\nsubscriptions, advertising, and co-branded credit cards.\nOur financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flows 1 . Free cash flows are driven primarily by increasing operating income and\nefficiently managing working capital 2 and cash capital expenditures, including our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment. Increases in operating\nincome primarily result from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs, partially offset by investments we make in\nlonger-term strategic initiatives. To increase sales of products and services, we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience, including lowering\nprices, improving availability, offering faster delivery and performance times, increasing selection, increasing product categories and service offerings, expanding\nproduct information, improving ease of use, improving reliability, and earning customer trust.\nWe seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs.

On average, our high inventory velocity\nmeans we generally collect from consumers before our payments to suppliers come due.

Our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to\ngeographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations.

The SEC has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the\nportrayal of the company’s financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often\nas a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and\njudgments addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to\nunderstanding our results. For additional information, see Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1—Description of Business and\nAccounting Policies.” Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available.\nActual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions.\nInventories\nInventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost and\nnet realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as\nthrough sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. These assumptions\nabout future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material write-downs in the\nfuture. As a measure of sensitivity, for every 1% of additional inventory valuation allowance as of December 31, 2017 , we would have recorded an additional cost\nof sales of approximately $180 million.\nIn addition, we enter into supplier commitments for certain electronic device components and certain products offered in our Whole Foods Market stores.\nThese commitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, and administrative practices in\nvarious jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, with or without notice, due to economic, political, and other conditions, and significant judgment is\nrequired in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes.

In addition, a\nnumber of countries are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, such as the recently enacted U.S. tax reform legislation\ncommonly referred to as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “2017 Tax Act”). Finally, foreign governments may enact tax laws in response to the 2017\nTax Act that could result in further changes to global taxation and materially affect our financial position and results of operations.\nThe 2017 Tax Act significantly changes how the U.S. taxes corporations. The 2017 Tax Act requires complex computations to be performed that were not\npreviously required in U.S. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the 2017 Tax Act and significant estimates in\ncalculations, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced.

On March 23, 2017, the U.S. Tax Court issued its decision\nregarding the issues raised in the IRS NOPAs. The Tax Court rejected the approach from the IRS NOPAs in determining transfer pricing adjustments in 2005 and\n2006 for the transactions undertaken with our foreign subsidiaries and adopted, with adjustments, our suggested approach. On September 29, 2017, the IRS filed a\nnotice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. We will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. If the Tax Court decision were\nreversed on appeal or if the IRS were to successfully assert transfer pricing adjustments of a similar nature to the NOPAs for transactions in subsequent years, we\ncould be subject to significant additional tax liabilities. In addition, in October 2014, the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether\ndecisions by the tax authorities in Luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on\nstate aid. On October 4, 2017, the European Commission announced its decision that determinations by the tax authorities in Luxembourg did not comply with\nEuropean Union rules on state aid.

In December 2017, Luxembourg appealed the European\nCommission’s decision. While the European Commission announced an estimated recovery amount of approximately €250 million, plus interest, the actual amount\nof additional taxes subject to recovery is to be calculated by the Luxembourg tax authorities in accordance with the European Commission’s guidance.

Our long-term debt is carried at\namortized cost and fluctuations in interest rates do not impact our consolidated financial statements. However, the fair value of our debt, which pays interest at a\nfixed rate, will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates\nof interest. All of our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities are designated as available-for-sale and, accordingly, are presented at fair value on\nour consolidated balance sheets. We generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities and AAA-rated\nmoney market funds. Fixed income securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, and we may suffer losses in\nprincipal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates.\nThe following table provides information about our cash equivalents and marketable fixed income securities, including principal cash flows by expected\nmaturity and the related weighted-average interest rates as of December 31, 2017 (in millions, except percentages):\n \n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\nThereafter\nTotal\nEstimated Fair\nValue as of\nDecember 31,\n2017\nMoney market funds\n$\n11,343\n$\n—\n$\n—\n$\n—\n$\n—\n$\n—\n$\n11,343\n$\n11,343\nWeighted-average interest rate\n0.61%\n0.61%\nCorporate debt securities\n2,717\n868\n484\n155\n25\n—\n4,249\n4,257\nWeighted-average interest rate\n1.79%\n2.10%\n2.27%\n2.23%\n2.00%\n1.93%\nU.S. government and agency securities\n2,995\n1,476\n310\n54\n1\n—\n4,836\n4,823\nWeighted-average interest rate\n1.49%\n1.98%\n2.06%\n2.41%\n2.64%\n1.69%\nAsset backed securities\n341\n273\n262\n31\n—\n—\n907\n905\nWeighted-average interest rate\n1.86%\n2.29%\n2.24%\n2.05%\n2.11%\nForeign government and agency\nsecurities\n405\n216\n—\n—\n—\n—\n621\n620\nWeighted-average interest rate\n1.75%\n1.93%\n1.81%\nOther securities\n159\n99\n43\n31\n—\n—\n332\n338\nWeighted-average interest rate\n1.15%\n1.84%\n2.24%\n2.48%\n1.62%\n$\n17,960\n$\n2,932\n$\n1,099\n$\n271\n$\n26\n$\n—\n$\n22,288\nCash equivalent and marketable",

Net sales and related expenses generated from our\ninternationally-focused websites, and from www.amazon.ca and www.amazon.com.mx (which are included in our North America segment), are primarily\ndenominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding websites and primarily include Euros, Japanese Yen, and British Pounds. The results of operations\nof, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our internationally-focused websites and AWS are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations.\nUpon consolidation, as foreign exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant\ngains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. For example, as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates throughout the period compared\nto rates in effect the prior year, International segment net sales increased by $137 million in comparison with the prior year.\nWe have foreign exchange risk related to foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (“foreign funds”). Based on the balance of\nforeign funds as of December 31, 2017 , of $11.1 billion , an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in fair value declines of\n$555 million, $1.1 billion, and $2.2 billion. All investments are classified as “available-for-sale.” Fluctuations in fair value are recorded in “Accumulated other\ncomprehensive loss,” a separate component of stockholders’ equity.\nWe have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in various foreign currencies. Based on the intercompany balances as of\nDecember 31, 2017 , an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in losses of $280 million, $600 million, and $1.3 billion,\nrecorded to “Other income (expense), net.”\nSee Item 7 of Part I",

We seek to be Earth’s most customer-centric company. In each of our segments,\nwe serve our primary customer sets, consisting of consumers, sellers, developers, enterprises, and content creators. We serve consumers through our retail websites\nand physical stores and focus on selection, price, and convenience. We also manufacture and sell electronic devices. We offer programs that enable sellers to sell\ntheir products on our websites and their own branded websites and to fulfill orders through us, and programs that allow authors, musicians, filmmakers, app\ndevelopers, and others to publish and sell content. We serve developers and enterprises of all sizes through our AWS segment, which offers a broad set of global\ncompute, storage, database, and other service offerings. In addition, we provide services, such as fulfillment, publishing, certain digital content subscriptions,\nadvertising, and co-branded credit cards.\nWe have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. See “Note 11—Segment Information.”\nPrior Period Reclassifications\nCertain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation, including the expanded presentation of “Net cash provided\nby (used in) investing activities” on our consolidated statements of cash flows and the allocation of stock-based compensation to “Other operating expense, net” in\nthe segment results within “Note 11 - Segment Information.” These revised segment results reflect the way our chief operating decision maker evaluates the\nCompany’s business performance and manages its operations. In addition, excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation were reclassified from “Net cash\nprovided by (used in) financing activities” to “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities” on our consolidated statements of cash flows as a result of the\nadoption of new accounting guidance.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Amazon.com, Inc., its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and those entities in which we have a\nvariable interest and of which we are the primary beneficiary, including certain entities in India and China and that support our seller lending financing activities\n(collectively, the “Company”). Intercompany balances and transactions between consolidated entities are eliminated. The financial results of Whole Foods Market,\nInc. (“Whole Foods Market”) have been included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition on August 28, 2017.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumpti",

Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.\nEarnings per Share\nBasic earnings per share is calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common shares. Diluted earnings per share is calculated using our weighted-\naverage outstanding common shares including the dilutive effect of stock awards as determined under the treasury stock method. In periods when we have a net\nloss, stock awards are excluded from our calculation of earnings per share as their inclusion would have an antidilutive effect.\n42\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe following table shows the calculation of diluted shares (in millions):\n   \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2015\n2016\n2017\nShares used in computation of basic earnings per share\n467\n474\n480\nTotal dilutive effect of outstanding stock awards\n10\n10\n13\nShares used in computation of diluted earnings per share\n477\n484\n493\nRevenue\nWe recognize revenue from product sales or services rendered when the following four criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,\ndelivery has occurred or service has been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. Revenue arrangements with\nmultiple deliverables are divided into separate units and revenue is allocated using estimated selling prices if we do not have vendor-specific objective evidence or\nthird-party evidence of the selling prices of the deliverables. We allocate the arrangement price to each of the elements based on the relative selling prices of each\nelement. Estimated selling prices are management’s best estimates of the prices that we would charge our customers if we were to sell the standalone elements\nseparately and include considerations of customer demand, prices charged by us and others for similar deliverables, and the price if largely based on the cost of\nproducing the product or service.\nSales of certain of our digital devices are considered arrangements with multiple deliverables, consisting of the device, undelivered software upgrades and/or\nundelivered non-software services such as cloud services.

The revenue related to the deliverables is amortized over the life of the membership based on the\nestimated delivery of services. Amazon Prime membership fees are allocated between product sales and service sales. Costs to deliver Amazon Prime benefits are\nrecognized as cost of sales as incurred. As we add more benefits to the Prime membership, we update the method of determining the estimated selling prices of\neach element as well as the allocation of Prime membership fees.\nWe evaluate whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of product sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally,\nwhen we are primarily obligated in a transaction, are subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, or have several but not\nall of these indicators, revenue is recorded at the gross sale price. We generally record the net amounts as commissions earned if we are not primarily obligated and\ndo not have latitude in establishing prices. Such amounts earned are determined using fixed fees, a percentage of seller revenues, per-unit activity fees, or some\ncombination thereof.\nProduct sales represent revenue from the sale of products and related shipping fees and digital media content where we record revenue gross. Product sales\nand shipping revenues, net of promotional discounts, rebates, and return allowances, are recorded when the products are shipped and title passes to customers.\nRetail sales to customers are made pursuant to a sales contract that provides for transfer of both title and risk of loss upon our delivery to the carrier or the\ncustomer. Amazon’s electronic devices sold through retailers are recognized at the point of sale to consumers.\nService sales represent third-party seller fees earned (including commissions) and related shipping fees, AWS sales, certain digital content subscriptions,\ncertain advertising services, and our co-branded credit card agreements.

We\ngenerally consider amounts received from vendors to be a reduction of the prices we pay for their goods, including property and equipment, or services, and\ntherefore record those amounts as a reduction of the cost of inventory, cost of services, or cost of property and equipment. Vendor rebates are typically dependent\nupon reaching minimum purchase thresholds. We evaluate the likelihood of reaching purchase thresholds using past experience and current year forecasts. When\nvolume rebates can be reasonably estimated, we record a portion of the rebate as we make progress towards the purchase threshold.\nWhen we receive direct reimbursements for costs incurred by us in advertising the vendor’s product or service, the amount we receive is recorded as an\noffset to “Marketing” on our consolidated statements of operations.\nFulfillment\nFulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International segments’ fulfillment centers,\ncustomer service centers, and physical stores, including costs attributable to buy",

We consider many factors when\nestimating expected forfeitures, including employee level, economic conditions, time remaining to vest, and historical forfeiture experience.\nOther Operating Expense, Net\nOther operating expense, net, consists primarily of marketing-related, contract-based, and customer-related intangible asset amortization expense, and\nexpenses related to legal settlements.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net, consists primarily of foreign currency gains (losses) of $(266) million , $21 million , and $247 million in 2015 , 2016 , and\n2017 , equity warrant valuation gains (losses) of $0 million , $67 million , and $109 million in 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 , and realized gains (losses) on marketable\nsecurities sales of $(5) million , $(8) million , and $(7) million in 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 .\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense includes U.S. (federal and state) and foreign income taxes. Tax legislation commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the\n“2017 Tax Act”) includes a mandatory one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, and as a result, all previously unremitted earnings for which\nno U.S. deferred tax liability had been accrued have now been subject to U.S. tax. Notwithstanding the U.S. taxation of these amounts, we intend to continue to\ninvest most or all of these earnings, as well as our capital in these subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. and do not expect to incur any significant, additional\ntaxes related to such amounts.\nDeferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are\nstated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered.\nDeferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe they will not be realized. We consider\nmany factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent cumulative loss experience and expectations of\nfuture earnings, capital gains and investment in such jurisdiction, the carry-forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors.\nWe utilize a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain income tax positions (tax contingencies).

We include interest and penalties related to our tax contingencies in income tax expense.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at\nthe measurement date. To increase the comparability of fair value measures, the following hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to\nmeasure fair value:\nLevel 1 —Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.\nLevel 2 —Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in\nactive markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be\ncorroborated by observable market data.\nLevel 3 —Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other\nmarket participants. These valuations require significant judgment.\n45\n\n\nTable of Contents\nFor our cash, cash equivalents, or marketable securities, we measure the fair value of money market funds and equity securities based on quoted prices in\nactive markets for identical assets or liabilities. All other financial instruments were valued either based on recent trades of securities in inactive markets or based\non quoted market prices of similar instruments and other significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. We did not hold any cash, cash\nequivalents, or marketable securities categorized as Level 3 assets as of December 31, 2016 and 2017 .\nAs part of entering into commercial agreements, we often obtain equity warrant assets giving us the right to acquire stock of other companies. As of\nDecember 31, 2016 and 2017 , these warrants had a fair value of $223 million and $441 million , and are recorded within “Other assets” on our consolidated\nbalance sheets. The related gain (loss) recorded in “Other income (expense), net” was $0 million , $67 million , and $109 million in 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 . These\nassets are primarily classified as Level 2 assets.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nWe classify all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents.\nInventories\nInventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in, first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost and\nnet realizable value.

Third-party sellers maintain ownership of their inventory,\nregardless of whether fulfillment is provided by us or the third-party sellers, and therefore these products are not included in our inventories.\nWe also purchase electronic device components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our\nproducts. During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate supply, we enter into agreements with\ncontract manufacturers and suppliers for certain electronic device components. A portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements\nconsists of firm, non-cancellable commitments. These commitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur\nadditional costs.

Equipment includes assets such as furniture and fixtures, heavy equipment,\nservers and networking equipment, and internal-use software and website development. Depreciation is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful\nlives of the assets (generally the lesser of 40 years or the remaining life of the underlying building, two years for assets such as internal-use software, three years\nfor our servers, five years for networking equipment, five years for furniture and fixtures, and ten years for heavy equipment). Depreciation expense is classified\nwithin the corresponding operating expense categories on our consolidated statements of operations.\nLeases and Asset Retirement Obligations\nWe categorize leases at their inception as either operating or capital leases. On certain of our lease agreements, we may receive rent holidays and other\nincentives. We recognize lease costs on a straight-line basis without regard to deferred payment terms, such as rent holidays, that defer the commencement date of\nrequired payments. Additionally, incentives we receive are treated as a reduction of our costs over the term of the agreement. Leasehold improvements are\ncapitalized at cost and amortized over the lesser of their expected useful life or the non-cancellable term of the lease.\nWe establish assets and liabilities for the estimated construction costs incurred under build-to-suit lease arrangements to the extent we are involved in the\nconstruction of structural improvements or take construction risk prior to commencement of a lease. Upon occupancy of facilities under build-to-suit leases, we\nassess whether these arrangements qualify for sales recognition under the sale-leaseback accounting guidance. If we continue to be the deemed owner, the facilities\nare accounted for as finance leases.\nWe establish assets and liabilities for the present value of estimated future costs to retire long-lived assets at the termination or expiration of a lease.

In testing goodwill for impairment, we may elect to utilize a qualitative assessment to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of\na reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If our qualitative assessment indicates that goodwill impairment is more likely than not, we perform a two-step\nimpairment test. We test goodwill for impairment under the two-step impairment test by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the\nreporting units. If the fair value is determined to be less than the book value or qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired, a\nsecond step is performed to compute the amount of impairment as the difference between the estimated fair value of goodwill and the carrying value. We estimate\nthe fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating\nexpenses, based primarily on expected category expansion, pricing, market segment share, and general economic conditions.\nWe completed the required annual testing of goodwill for impairment for all reporting units as of April 1, 2017, and determined that goodwill is no t\nimpaired as the fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeded their book value.

When the license fee for a specific movie, television, or music title is determinable or reasonably estimable and the content is\navailable for streaming, we recognize an asset representing the fee and a corresponding liability for the amounts owed. We relieve the liability as payments are\nmade and we amortize the asset to “Cost of sales” on a straight-line basis or on an accelerated basis, based on estimated usage patterns, which typically ranges\nfrom one to five years.

Conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an\nasset, a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, or any other significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of\nan asset or group of assets may not be recoverable.\nFor long-lived assets used in operations, impairment losses are only recorded if the asset’s carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted,\nprobability-weighted future cash flows. We measure the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and estimated fair value. Long-lived\nassets are considered held for sale when certain criteria are met, including when management has committed to a plan to sell the asset, the asset is available for sale\nin its immediate condition, and the sale is probable within one year of the reporting date.

The ASU defines\nnet realizable value as the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation.\nThe ASU is applicable to inventory that is accounted for under the first-in, first-out method. We adopted this ASU in Q1 2017 with no material impact to our\nconsolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued an ASU amending the accounting for stock-based compensation and requiring excess tax benefits and deficiencies to be\nrecognized as a component of income tax expense rather than equity. The inclusion of excess tax benefits and deficiencies as a component of our income tax\nexpense will increase volatility within our provision for income taxes as the amount of excess tax benefits or deficiencies from stock-based compensation awards\ndepends on our stock price at the date the awards vest. This guidance also requires excess tax benefits to be presented as an operating activity on the statement of\ncash flows and allows an entity to make an accounting policy election to either estimate expected forfeitures or to account for them as they occur. We adopted this\nASU in Q1 2017 by recording the cumulative impact through an increase in retained earnings of $687 million , and we will continue to estimate expected\nforfeitures. Additionally, we retrospectively adjusted our consolidated statements of cash flows to reclassify excess tax benefits of $119 million and $829 million\nfor the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2016 from financing activities to operating activities.\nAccounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn May 20",

We will adopt this ASU on\nJanuary 1, 2018 with a cumulative adjustment that will increase retained earnings by approximately $650 million rather than retrospectively adjusting prior\nperiods. The cumulative adjustment will primarily relate to unredeemed gift cards. We will begin to recognize revenue from estimated unredeemed gift cards over\nthe expected customer redemption period, which is substantially within nine months, rather than waiting until gift cards expire or when the likelihood of\nredemption becomes remote, generally two years from the date of issuance. Other changes relate to Amazon-branded electronic devices sold through retailers,\nwhich will be recognized upon sale to the retailer rather than to end customers. We also will change how we recognize and classify Amazon Prime memberships,\nwhich are currently considered arrangements with multiple deliverables that are allocated among products sales and service sales. Upon adoption of the ASU,\nAmazon Prime memberships will be accounted for as a single performance obligation recognized ratably over the membership period and will be classified as\nservice sales. Other changes that we have identified relate primarily to the presentation of revenue. Certain advertising services will be classified as revenue rather\nthan a reduction in cost of sales, and sales of apps, in-app content, and certain digital media content will primarily be presented on a net basis.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued an ASU which updates certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments.\nUnder this ASU, certain equity investments will be measured at fair value with changes recognized in net income. The ASU is effective for reporting periods\nbeginning after December 15, 2017. We do not expect adoption of the ASU in Q1 2018 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued an ASU amending the accounting for leases.

For intercompany transfers of inventory, the income\ntax effects will continue to be deferred until the inventory has been sold to a third party.

These\nexaminations may lead to ordinary course adjustments or proposed adjustments to our taxes or our net operating losses with respect to years under examination as\nwell as subsequent periods. As previously disclosed, we have received Notices of Proposed Adjustment (“NOPAs”) from the IRS for transactions undertaken in the\n2005 and 2006 calendar years relating to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries. The IRS is seeking to increase our U.S. taxable income by an amount that\nwould result in additional federal tax of approximately $1.5 billion , subject to interest. On March 23, 2017, the U.S. Tax Court issued its decision regarding the\nissues raised in the IRS NOPAs. The Tax Court rejected the approach from the IRS NOPAs in determining transfer pricing adjustments in 2005 and 2006 for the\ntransactions undertaken with our foreign subsidiaries and adopted, with adjustments, our suggested approach. On September 29, 2017, the IRS filed a notice of\nappeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. We will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. If the Tax Court decision were reversed\non appeal or if the IRS were to successfully assert transfer pricing adjustments of a similar nature to the NOPAs for transactions in subsequent years, we could be\nsubject to significant additional tax liabilities.\nCertain of our subsidiaries were under examination or investigation by the French Tax Administration (“FTA”) for calendar year 2006 and thereafter.

In December 2017, we settled this dispute with the FTA and included the impact thereof within our financial statements. In addition, in October 2014, the\nEuropean Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in Luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax\npaid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid. On October 4, 2017, the European Commission announced its decision that\ndeterminations by the tax authorities in Luxembourg did not comply with European Union rules on state aid. This decision orders Luxembourg to calculate and\nrecover additional taxes from us for the period May 2006 through June 2014. We believe this decision to be without merit and will consider our legal options,\nincluding an appeal. In December 2017, Luxembourg appealed the European Commission’s decision. While the European Commission announced an estimated\nrecovery amount of approximately  €250 million , plus interest, the actual amount of additional taxes subject to recovery is to be calculated by the Luxembourg tax\nauthorities in accordance with the European Commission’s guidance. Once the recovery amount is computed by Luxembourg, we anticipate funding it, including\ninterest, into escrow, where it will remain pending conclusion of all appeals. We may be required to fund into escrow an amount in excess of the estimated\nrecovery amount announced by the European Commission. We are also subject to taxation in various states and other foreign jurisdictions including Canada,\nChina, Germany, India, Japan,\n67\n\n\nTable of Contents\nLuxembourg, and the United Kingdom.  We are under, or may be subject to, audit or examination and additional assessments by the relevant authorities in respect\nof these particular jurisdictions primarily for 2008 and thereafter.\nWe expect the total amount of tax contingencies will grow in 2018 . In addition, changes in state, federal, and foreign tax laws may increase our tax\ncontingencies. The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain, and the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues\nraised by the taxing authorities may differ from the amounts accrued. It is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months we will receive additional\nassessments by various tax authorities or possibly reach resolution of income tax examinations in one or more jurisdictions. These assessments or settlements could\nresult in changes to our contingencies related to positions on tax filings in years through 2017 .

Our responsibility is to\nexpress an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and\nrequired to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and\nevaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary\nin the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting\nand the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of\nfinancial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of\nunauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with\nthe policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nSeattle, Washington\nFebruary 1, 2018\n74\n\n\nTable of Contents\nItem 9B.\nOther Information\nDisclosure Pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act\nWe determined that, between January 2012 and December 2017, we processed and delivered orders of consumer products for cer",

We seek to be Earth’s most customer-centric company. We are guided by four\nprinciples: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. In each of our\nsegments, we serve our primary customer sets, consisting of consumers, sellers, developers, enterprises, and content creators. In addition, we provide services, such\nas advertising services and co-branded credit card agreements.\nWe have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and Amazon Web Services (“AWS”). These segments reflect the way\nthe Company evaluates its business performance and manages its operations. Additional information on our operating segments and our net sales is contained in\nItem 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 11—Segment Information.” Our company-sponsored research and development expense is\nset forth within “Technology and content” in Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Consolidated Statements of Operations.” The\nfinancial results of Whole Foods Market, Inc.

We design our websites to enable\nhundreds of millions of unique products to be sold by us and by third parties across dozens of product categories. Customers access our offerings through our\nwebsites, mobile apps, Alexa, and physically visiting our stores. We also manufacture and sell electronic devices, including Kindle e-readers, Fire tablets, Fire\nTVs, and Echo devices, and we develop and produce media content. We strive to offer our customers the lowest prices possible through low everyday product\npricing and shipping offers, and to improve our operating efficiencies so that we can continue to lower prices for our customers. We also provide easy-to-use\nfunctionality, fast and reliable fulfillment, and timely customer service. In addition, we offer Amazon Prime, a membership program that includes unlimited free\nshipping on tens of millions of items, access to unlimited instant streaming of thousands of movies and TV episodes, and other benefits.\nWe fulfill customer orders in a number of ways, including through: North America and International fulfillment and delivery networks that we operate; co-\nsourced and outsourced arrangements in certain countries; digital delivery; and through our ",

The worldwide marketplace in which we compete is\nevolving rapidly and intensely competitive, and we face a broad array of competitors from many different industry sectors around the world. Our current and\npotential competitors include: (1) online, offline, and multichannel retailers, publishers, vendors, distributors, manufacturers, and producers of the products we\noffer and sell to consumers and businesses; (2) publishers, producers, and distributors of physical, digital, and interactive media of all types and all distribution\nchannels; (3) web search engines, comparison shopping websites, social networks, web portals, and other online and app-based means of discovering, using, or\nacquiring goods and services, either directly or in collaboration with other retailers; (4) companies that provide e-commerce services, including website\ndevelopment, advertising, fulfillment, customer service, and payment processing; (5) companies that provide fulfillment and logistics services for themselves or for\nthird parties, whether online or offline; (6) companies that provide information technology services or products, including on-premises or cloud-based\ninfrastructure and other services; and (7) companies that design, manufacture, market, or sell consumer electronics, telecommunication, and electronic devices.

Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longer\nhistories, more customers, and/or greater brand recognition, particularly with our newly-launched products and services and in our newer geographic regions. They\nmay secure better terms from vendors, adopt more aggressive pricing, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing.\nCompetition may intensify, including with the development of new business models and the entry of new and well-funded competitors, and as our\ncompetitors enter into business combinations or alliances and established companies in other market segments expand to become competitive with our business. In\naddition, new and enhanced technologies, including search, web and infrastructure computing services, digital content, and electronic devices, may increase our\ncompetition. The Internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping, and increased competition may reduce our sales and profits.\nOur Expansion Places a Significant Strain on our Management, Operational, Financial, and Other Resources\nWe are rapidly and significantly expanding our global operations, including increasing our product and service offerings and scaling our infrastructure to\nsupport our retail and services businesses. This expansion increases the complexity of our business and places significant strain on our management, personnel,\noperations, systems, technical performance, financial resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions.

For example, in order to meet local ownership and regulatory licensing requirements,\nwww.amazon.cn is operated by PRC companies that are indirectly owned, either wholly or partially, by PRC nationals. In addition, we provide certain technology\nservices in China in conjunction with third parties that hold PRC licenses to provide services. In India, the government restricts the ownership or control of Indian\ncompanies by foreign entities involved in online multi-brand retail trading activities. For www.amazon.in, we provide certain marketing tools and logistics services\nto third-party sellers to enable them to sell online and deliver to customers, and we hold indirect minority interests in entities that are third-party sellers on the\nwww.amazon.in marketplace. Although we believe these structures and activities comply with existing laws, they involve unique risks, and the PRC is actively\nconsidering changes in its foreign investment rules that could impact these structures and activities.

In addition, a number of countries are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, such as the recently\nenacted U.S. tax reform legislation commonly referred to as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “2017 Tax Act”). Finally, foreign governments may enact\ntax laws in response to the 2017 Tax Act that could result in further changes to global taxation and materially affect our financial position and results of operations.\nThe 2017 Tax Act significantly changes how the U.S. taxes corporations. The 2017 Tax Act requires complex computations to be performed that were not\npreviously required in U.S. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the 2017 Tax Act and significant estimates in\ncalculations, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. The U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other\nstandard-setting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the 2017 Tax Act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our\ninterpretation. As we complete our analysis of the 2017 Tax Act, collect and prepare necessary data, and interpret any additional guidance, we may make\nadjustments to provisional amounts that we have recorded that may materially impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are\nmade.\nWe are also currently subject to audit in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us. Developments in\nan audit, litigation, or the relevant laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations could have a material effect on our operating results or\ncash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. For instance, we have received Notices of\nProposed Adjustment (“NOPAs”) from the IRS for transactions undertaken in the 2005 and 2006 calendar years relating to transfer pricing with our foreign\nsubsidiaries and we have been contesting the matter in U.S. Tax Court. On March 23, 2017, the U.S. Tax Court issued its decision regarding the issues raised in the\nIRS NOPAs. The Tax Court rejected the approach from the IRS NOPAs in determining transfer pricing adjustments in 2005 and 2006 for the transactions\nundertaken with our foreign subsidiaries a",

On September 29, 2017, the IRS filed a notice of appeal to the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. We will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. If the Tax Court decision were reversed on appeal or if\nthe IRS were to successfully assert transfer pricing adjustments of a similar nature to the NOPAs for transactions in subsequent years, we could be subject to\nsignificant additional tax liabilities. In addition, in October 2014, the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax\nauthorities in Luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid. On October\n4, 2017, the European Commission announced its decision that determinations by the tax authorities in Luxembourg did not comply with European Union rules on\nstate aid. This decision orders Luxembourg to calculate and recover additional taxes from us for the period May 2006 through June 2014. We believe this decision\nto be without merit and will consider our legal options, including an appeal. In December 2017, Luxembourg appealed the European Commission’s decision.\nWhile the European Commission announced an estimated recovery amount of approximately €250 million, plus interest, the actual amount of additional taxes\nsubject to recovery is to be calculated by the Luxembourg tax authorities in accordance with the European Commission’s guidance. Although we believe our tax\nestimates are reasonable, the final outcome of tax audits, investigations, and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax\nprovisions and accruals.\nOur Supplier Relationships Subject Us to a Number of Risks\nWe have significant suppliers, including licensors, and in some cases, limited or single-sources of supply, that are important to our sourcing, services,\nmanufacturing, and any related ongoing servicing of merchandise and content. We do not have long-term arrangements with most of our suppliers to guarantee\navailability of merchandise, content, components, or services, particular payment terms, or the extension of credit limits. If our current suppliers were to stop\nselling or licensing merchandise, content, components, or services to us on acceptable terms, or delay delivery, including as a result of one or more supplier\nbankruptcies due to poor economic conditions, as a result of natural disasters, or for other reasons, we may be unable to procure alternatives from other suppliers in\na timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, if our suppliers or other vendors violate applicable laws, regulations, our code of\nstandards and responsibilities, or implement practices regarded as unethical, unsafe, or hazardous to the environment, it could damage our reputation, limit our\ngrowth, and negatively affect our operating results.\n13\n\n\nTable of ",

We may be subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts, and any\nviolations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contract, refunding or suspending of payments,\nforfeiture of profits, payment of fines, and suspension or debarment from future government business. In addition, such contracts may provide for termination by\nthe government at any time, without cause.\nWe May Be Subject to Product Liability Claims if People or Property Are Harmed by the Products We Sell or Manufacture\nSome of the products we sell or manufacture may expose us to product liability or food safety claims relating to personal injury or illness, death, or\nenvironmental or property damage, and may require product recalls or other actions. Certain third parties also sell products using our e-commerce services that\nmay increase our exposure to product liability claims, such as if these sellers do not have sufficient protection from such claims. Although we maintain liability\ninsurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on\neconomically reasonable terms, or at all. In addition, some of our agreements with our vendors and sellers do not indemnify us from product liability.\nWe Are Subject to Payments-Related Risks\nWe accept payments using a variety of methods, including credit card, debit card, credit accounts (including promotional financing), gift cards, direct debit\nfrom a customer’s bank account, consumer invoicing, physical bank check, and payment upon delivery. For existing and future payment options we offer to our\ncustomers, we may become subject to additional regulations and compliance requirements (including obligations to implement enhanced authentication processes\nthat could result in significant costs and reduce the ease of use of our payments products), as well as fraud. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit\ncards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability. We rely on third parties to provide\ncertain Amazon-branded payment methods and payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, electronic checks, and\npromotional financing.

The products offered through our consumer-facing\nwebsites and physical stores primarily include merchandise and content we have purchased for resale from vendors and products offered by third-party sellers, and\nwe also manufacture and sell electronic devices. Generally, we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory as product sales and recognize our\nnet share of revenue of items sold by third-party sellers as service sales. We seek to increase unit sales across our businesses, through increased product selection,\nacross numerous product categories. We also offer other services such as compute, storage, and database offerings, fulfillment, publishing, certain digital content\nsubscriptions, advertising, and co-branded credit cards.\nOur financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flows 1 . Free cash flows are driven primarily by increasing operating income and\nefficiently managing working capital 2 and cash capital expenditures, including our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment. Increases in operating\nincome primarily result from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs, partially offset by investments we make in\nlonger-term strategic initiatives. To increase sales of products and services, we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience, including lowering\nprices, improving availability, offering faster delivery and performance times, increasing selection, increasing product categories and service offerings, expanding\nproduct information, improving ease of use, improving reliability, and earning customer trust.\nWe seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs.

On average, our high inventory velocity\nmeans we generally collect from consumers before our payments to suppliers come due. We expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected\nby numerous factors, including our product mix, the mix of sales by us and by third-party sellers, our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability and\nselection of product offerings, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent to which we choose to utilize third-party fulfillment providers.\nWe also expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors, including the mix of product sales, the mix of sales\nby third-party sellers, the mix of suppliers, seasonality, and changes in payment terms over time, including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment\nterms with suppliers.\nWe expect spending in technology and content will increase over time as we add computer scientists, designers, software and hardware engineers, and\nmerchandising employees. Our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to\ngeographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations.

The SEC has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the\nportrayal of the company’s financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often\nas a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and\njudgments addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to\nunderstanding our results. For additional information, see Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1—Description of Business and\nAccounting Policies.” Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available.\nActual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions.\nInventories\nInventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost and\nnet realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as\nthrough sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. These assumptions\nabout future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material write-downs in the\nfuture. As a measure of sensitivity, for every 1% of additional inventory valuation allowance as of December 31, 2017 , we would have recorded an additional cost\nof sales of approximately $180 million.\nIn addition, we enter into supplier commitments for certain electronic device components and certain products offered in our Whole Foods Market stores.\nThese commitments are based on forecasted customer demand.

Our effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, such as intercompany transactions, the relative\namount of our foreign earnings, including earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in\njurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, the applicability of special tax regimes, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the\nrelated tax benefit, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, entry into new businesses and geographies, changes to our existing businesses and operations,\nacquisitions (including integrations) and investments and how they are financed, changes in our stock price, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and\ntheir valuation, and changes in the relevant tax, accounting, and other laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations. In addition, a\nnumber of countries are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, such as the recently enacted U.S. tax reform legislation\ncommonly referred to as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “2017 Tax Act”). Finally, foreign governments may enact tax laws in response to the 2017\nTax Act that could result in further changes to global taxation and materially affect our financial position and results of operations.\nThe 2017 Tax Act significantly changes how the U.S. taxes corporations. The 2017 Tax Act requires complex computations to be performed that were not\npreviously required in U.S. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the 2017 Tax Act and significant estimates in\ncalculations, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. The U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other\nstandard-setting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the 2017 Tax Act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our\ninterpretation. As we complete our analysis of the 2017 Tax Act, collect and prepare necessary data, and interpret any additional guidance, we may make\nadjustments to provisional amounts that we have recorded that may materially impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are\nmade.\nWe are also currently subject to audit in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us. Developments in\nan audit, litigation, or the relevant laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations could have a material effect on our operating results or\ncash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods.

On March 23, 2017, the U.S. Tax Court issued its decision\nregarding the issues raised in the IRS NOPAs. The Tax Court rejected the approach from the IRS NOPAs in determining transfer pricing adjustments in 2005 and\n2006 for the transactions undertaken with our foreign subsidiaries and adopted, with adjustments, our suggested approach. On September 29, 2017, the IRS filed a\nnotice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. We will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. If the Tax Court decision were\nreversed on appeal or if the IRS were to successfully assert transfer pricing adjustments of a similar nature to the NOPAs for transactions in subsequent years, we\ncould be subject to significant additional tax liabilities. In addition, in October 2014, the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether\ndecisions by the tax authorities in Luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on\nstate aid. On October 4, 2017, the European Commission announced its decision that determinations by the tax authorities in Luxembourg did not comply with\nEuropean Union rules on state aid. This decision orders Luxembourg to calculate and recover additional taxes from us for the period May 2006 through June 2014.\nWe believe this decision to be without merit and will consider our legal options, including an appeal. In December 2017, Luxembourg appealed the European\nCommission’s decision. While the European Commission announced an estimated recovery amount of approximately €250 million, plus interest, the actual amount\nof additional taxes subject to recovery is to be calculated by the Luxembourg tax authorities in accordance with the European Commission’s guidance.

We believe that offering\nlow prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success, and one way we offer lower prices is through shipping offers.\nCosts to operate our AWS segment are primarily classified as “Technology and content” as we leverage a shared infrastructure that supports both our internal\ntechnology requirements and external sales to AWS customers.\n27\n\n\nTable of Contents\nFulfillment\nFulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International fulfillment centers, customer service\ncenters, and physical stores and payment processing costs. While AWS payment processing and related transaction costs are included in fulfillment, AWS costs are\nprimarily classified as “Technology and content.” Fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors, such as payment processing and\nrelated transaction costs, our level of productivity and accuracy, changes in volume, size, and weight of units received and fulfilled, timing of fulfillment network\nand physical store expansion, the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties, mix of products and services sold, and our ability to affect\ncustomer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer self-service features. Additionally, because\npayment processing and fulfillment costs associated with seller transactions are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions, and payment\nprocessing and related transaction and fulfillment costs are higher as a percentage of sales versus our retail sales, sales by our sellers have higher fulfillment costs\nas a percent of net sales.\nThe increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars in 2016 and 2017 , compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to variable costs\ncorresponding with increased product and service sales volume and inventory levels, and costs from expanding our fulfillment network, which includes physical\nstores.\nWe seek to expand our fulfillment network to accommodate a greater selection and in-stock inventory levels and to meet anticipated shipment volumes from\nsales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services.

Net sales and related expenses generated from our\ninternationally-focused websites, and from www.amazon.ca and www.amazon.com.mx (which are included in our North America segment), are primarily\ndenominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding websites and primarily include Euros, Japanese Yen, and British Pounds. The results of operations\nof, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our internationally-focused websites and AWS are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations.\nUpon consolidation, as foreign exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant\ngains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. For example, as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates throughout the period compared\nto rates in effect the prior year, International segment net sales increased by $137 million in comparison with the prior year.\nWe have foreign exchange risk related to foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (“foreign funds”). Based on the balance of\nforeign funds as of December 31, 2017 , of $11.1 billion , an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in fair value declines of\n$555 million, $1.1 billion, and $2.2 billion. All investments are classified as “available-for-sale.” Fluctuations in fair value are recorded in “Accumulated other\ncomprehensive loss,” a separate component of stockholders’ equity.\nWe have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in various foreign currencies. Based on the intercompany balances as of\nDecember 31, 2017 , an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in losses of $280 million, $600 million, and $1.3 billion,\nrecorded to “Other income (expense), net.”\nSee Item 7 of Part I",

We record our\nequity and equity warrant investments in publicly traded companies at fair value, which is subject to market price volatility, and represents $415 million of our\ninvestments as of December 31, 2017 . We evaluate our equity and equity warrant investments in private companies for impairment when events and\ncircumstances indicate that the decline in fair value of such assets below the carrying value is other-than-temporary. Our analysis includes a review of recent\noperating results and trends, recent sales/acquisitions of the investee securities, and other publicly available data. The current global economic climate provides\nadditional uncertainty. Valuations of private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data.

We serve consumers through our retail websites\nand physical stores and focus on selection, price, and convenience. We also manufacture and sell electronic devices. We offer programs that enable sellers to sell\ntheir products on our websites and their own branded websites and to fulfill orders through us, and programs that allow authors, musicians, filmmakers, app\ndevelopers, and others to publish and sell content. We serve developers and enterprises of all sizes through our AWS segment, which offers a broad set of global\ncompute, storage, database, and other service offerings. In addition, we provide services, such as fulfillment, publishing, certain digital content subscriptions,\nadvertising, and co-branded credit cards.\nWe have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. See “Note 11—Segment Information.”\nPrior Period Reclassifications\nCertain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation, including the expanded presentation of “Net cash provided\nby (used in) investing activities” on our consolidated statements of cash flows and the allocation of stock-based compensation to “Other operating expense, net” in\nthe segment results within “Note 11 - Segment Information.” These revised segment results reflect the way our chief operating decision maker evaluates the\nCompany’s business performance and manages its operations. In addition, excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation were reclassified from “Net cash\nprovided by (used in) financing activities” to “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities” on our consolidated statements of cash flows as a result of the\nadoption of new accounting guidance.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Amazon.com, Inc., its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and those entities in which we have a\nvariable interest and of which we are the primary beneficiary, including certain entities in India and China and that support our seller lending financing activities\n(collectively, the “Company”).

We allocate the arrangement price to each of the elements based on the relative selling prices of each\nelement. Estimated selling prices are management’s best estimates of the prices that we would charge our customers if we were to sell the standalone elements\nseparately and include considerations of customer demand, prices charged by us and others for similar deliverables, and the price if largely based on the cost of\nproducing the product or service.\nSales of certain of our digital devices are considered arrangements with multiple deliverables, consisting of the device, undelivered software upgrades and/or\nundelivered non-software services such as cloud services.

We include interest and penalties related to our tax contingencies in income tax expense.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at\nthe measurement date. To increase the comparability of fair value measures, the following hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to\nmeasure fair value:\nLevel 1 —Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.\nLevel 2 —Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in\nactive markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be\ncorroborated by observable market data.\nLevel 3 —Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other\nmarket participants. These valuations require significant judgment.\n45\n\n\nTable of Contents\nFor our cash, cash equivalents, or marketable securities, we measure the fair value of money market funds and equity securities based on quoted prices in\nactive markets for identical assets or liabilities. All other financial instruments were valued either based on recent trades of securities in inactive markets or based\non quoted market prices of similar instruments and other significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.

Depreciation expense is classified\nwithin the corresponding operating expense categories on our consolidated statements of operations.\nLeases and Asset Retirement Obligations\nWe categorize leases at their inception as either operating or capital leases. On certain of our lease agreements, we may receive rent holidays and other\nincentives. We recognize lease costs on a straight-line basis without regard to deferred payment terms, such as rent holidays, that defer the commencement date of\nrequired payments. Additionally, incentives we receive are treated as a reduction of our costs over the term of the agreement. Leasehold improvements are\ncapitalized at cost and amortized over the lesser of their expected useful life or the non-cancellable term of the lease.\nWe establish assets and liabilities for the estimated construction costs incurred under build-to-suit lease arrangements to the extent we are involved in the\nconstruction of structural improvements or take construction risk prior to commencement of a lease. Upon occupancy of facilities under build-to-suit leases, we\nassess whether these arrangements qualify for sales recognition under the sale-leaseback accounting guidance.

If our qualitative assessment indicates that goodwill impairment is more likely than not, we perform a two-step\nimpairment test. We test goodwill for impairment under the two-step impairment test by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the\nreporting units. If the fair value is determined to be less than the book value or qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired, a\nsecond step is performed to compute the amount of impairment as the difference between the estimated fair value of goodwill and the carrying value.

Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating\nexpenses, based primarily on expected category expansion, pricing, market segment share, and general economic conditions.\nWe completed the required annual testing of goodwill for impairment for all reporting units as of April 1, 2017, and determined that goodwill is no t\nimpaired as the fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeded their book value.

In connection with the settlement and remeasurement of intercompany balances, we recorded a loss of $215 million in 2015\nand recorded gains of $62 million and $202 million in 2016 and 2017 .\nAccounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted\nIn July 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued an Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) modifying the accounting for inventory.\nUnder this ASU, the measurement principle for inventory changed from lower of cost or market value to lower of cost and net realizable value. The ASU defines\nnet realizable value as the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation.\nThe ASU is applicable to inventory that is accounted for under the first-in, first-out method. We adopted this ASU in Q1 2017 with no material impact to our\nconsolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued an ASU amending the accounting for stock-based compensation and requiring excess tax benefits and deficiencies to be\nrecognized as a component of income tax expense rather than equity. The inclusion of excess tax benefits and deficiencies as a component of our income tax\nexpense will increase volatility within our provision for income taxes as the amount of excess tax benefits or deficiencies from stock-based compensation awards\ndepends on our stock price at the date the awards vest. This guidance also requires excess tax benefits to be presented as an operating activity on the statement of\ncash flows and allows an entity to make an accounting policy election to either estimate expected forfeitures or to account for them as they occur. We adopted this\nASU in Q1 2017 by recording the cumulative impact through an increase in retained earnings of $687 million , and we will continue to estimate expected\nforfeitures. Additionally, we retrospectively adjusted our consolidated statements of cash flows to reclassify excess tax benefits of $119 million and $829 million\nfor the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2016 from financing activities to operating activities.\nAccounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn May 20",

We will adopt this ASU on\nJanuary 1, 2018 with a cumulative adjustment that will increase retained earnings by approximately $650 million rather than retrospectively adjusting prior\nperiods. The cumulative adjustment will primarily relate to unredeemed gift cards. We will begin to recognize revenue from estimated unredeemed gift cards over\nthe expected customer redemption period, which is substantially within nine months, rather than waiting until gift cards expire or when the likelihood of\nredemption becomes remote, generally two years from the date of issuance. Other changes relate to Amazon-branded electronic devices sold through retailers,\nwhich will be recognized upon sale to the retailer rather than to end customers. We also will change how we recognize and classify Amazon Prime memberships,\nwhich are currently considered arrangements with multiple deliverables that are allocated among products sales and service sales. Upon adoption of the ASU,\nAmazon Prime memberships will be accounted for as a single performance obligation recognized ratably over the membership period and will be classified as\nservice sales. Other changes that we have identified relate primarily to the presentation of revenue. Certain advertising services will be classified as revenue rather\nthan a reduction in cost of sales, and sales of apps, in-app content, and certain digital media content will primarily be presented on a net basis.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued an ASU which updates certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments.\nUnder this ASU, certain equity investments will be measured at fair value with changes recognized in net income. The ASU is effective for reporting periods\nbeginning after December 15, 2017. We do not expect adoption of the ASU in Q1 2018 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued an ASU amending the accounting for leases. The new guidance requires the recognition of lease assets and liabilities for\noperating leases with terms of more than 12 months, in addition to those currently recorded, on our consolidated balance sheets. Presentation of leases within the\nconsolidated statements of operations and\n49\n\n\nTable of Contents\nconsolidated statements of cash flows will be generally consistent with the current lease accounting guidance. The ASU is effective for reporting periods beginning\nafter December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We plan to adopt this ASU beginning in Q1 2019.

The new guidance requires the recognition of the income tax\nconsequences of an intercompany asset transfer, other than transfers of inventory, when the transfer occurs. For intercompany transfers of inventory, the income\ntax effects will continue to be deferred until the inventory has been sold to a third party. The ASU is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15,\n2017, with early adoption permitted. We will adopt this ASU beginning in Q1 2018. We estimate the ASU will have an impact of approximately $250 million on\nour consolidated financial statements, including retained earnings and deferred taxes. This estimate takes into account valuation allowances that we anticipate\nrecording against certain material deferred tax assets. Any change in our assessment of the likelihood of our ability to realize deferred tax assets will be reflected as\nan income tax benefit during the quarter of such change.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued an ASU amending the presentation of restricted cash within the statement of cash flows. The new guidance requires that\nrestricted cash be included within cash and cash equivalents on the statement of cash flows. The ASU is effective retrospectively for reporting periods beginning\nafter December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted.

In December 2017, we settled this dispute with the FTA and included the impact thereof within our financial statements. In addition, in October 2014, the\nEuropean Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in Luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax\npaid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid. On October 4, 2017, the European Commission announced its decision that\ndeterminations by the tax authorities in Luxembourg did not comply with European Union rules on state aid. This decision orders Luxembourg to calculate and\nrecover additional taxes from us for the period May 2006 through June 2014. We believe this decision to be without merit and will consider our legal options,\nincluding an appeal. In December 2017, Luxembourg appealed the European Commission’s decision. While the European Commission announced an estimated\nrecovery amount of approximately  €250 million , plus interest, the actual amount of additional taxes subject to recovery is to be calculated by the Luxembourg tax\nauthorities in accordance with the European Commission’s guidance. Once the recovery amount is computed by Luxembourg, we anticipate funding it, including\ninterest, into escrow, where it will remain pending conclusion of all appeals.

Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and\nevaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary\nin the circumstances.

A company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of\nfinancial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of\nunauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with\nthe policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nSeattle, Washington\nFebruary 1, 2018\n74\n\n\nTable of Contents\nItem 9B.\nOther Information\nDisclosure Pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act\nWe determined that, between January 2012 and December 2017, we processed and delivered orders of consumer products for cer",

We seek to be Earth’s most customer-centric company. We are guided by four\nprinciples: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. In each of our\nsegments, we serve our primary customer sets, consisting of consumers, sellers, developers, enterprises, and content creators. In addition, we provide services, such\nas advertising services and co-branded credit card agreements.\nWe have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and Amazon Web Services (“AWS”). These segments reflect the way\nthe Company evaluates its business performance and manages its operations. Additional information on our operating segments and our net sales is contained in\nItem 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 11—Segment Information.” Our company-sponsored research and development expense is\nset forth within “Technology and content” in Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Consolidated Statements of Operations.” The\nfinancial results of Whole Foods Market, Inc.

We design our websites to enable\nhundreds of millions of unique products to be sold by us and by third parties across dozens of product categories. Customers access our offerings through our\nwebsites, mobile apps, Alexa, and physically visiting our stores. We also manufacture and sell electronic devices, including Kindle e-readers, Fire tablets, Fire\nTVs, and Echo devices, and we develop and produce media content. We strive to offer our customers the lowest prices possible through low everyday product\npricing and shipping offers, and to improve our operating efficiencies so that we can continue to lower prices for our customers. We also provide easy-to-use\nfunctionality, fast and reliable fulfillment, and timely customer service. In addition, we offer Amazon Prime, a membership program that includes unlimited free\nshipping on tens of millions of items, access to unlimited instant streaming of thousands of movies and TV episodes, and other benefits.\nWe fulfill customer orders in a number of ways, including through: North America and International fulfillment and delivery networks that we operate; co-\nsourced and outsourced arrangements in certain countries; digital delivery; and through our ",

The worldwide marketplace in which we compete is\nevolving rapidly and intensely competitive, and we face a broad array of competitors from many different industry sectors around the world. Our current and\npotential competitors include: (1) online, offline, and multichannel retailers, publishers, vendors, distributors, manufacturers, and producers of the products we\noffer and sell to consumers and businesses; (2) publishers, producers, and distributors of physical, digital, and interactive media of all types and all distribution\nchannels; (3) web search engines, comparison shopping websites, social networks, web portals, and other online and app-based means of discovering, using, or\nacquiring goods and services, either directly or in collaboration with other retailers; (4) companies that provide e-commerce services, including website\ndevelopment, advertising, fulfillment, customer service, and payment processing; (5) companies that provide fulfillment and logistics services for themselves or for\nthird parties, whether online or offline; (6) companies that provide information technology services or products, including on-premises or cloud-based\ninfrastructure and other services; and (7) companies that design, manufacture, market, or sell consumer electronics, telecommunication, and electronic devices.

Each of our businesses is also subject to rapid change and the\ndevelopment of new business models and the entry of new and well-funded competitors.

Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longer\nhistories, more customers, and/or greater brand recognition, particularly with our newly-launched products and services and in our newer geographic regions. They\nmay secure better terms from vendors, adopt more aggressive pricing, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing.\nCompetition may intensify, including with the development of new business models and the entry of new and well-funded competitors, and as our\ncompetitors enter into business combinations or alliances and established companies in other market segments expand to become competitive with our business. In\naddition, new and enhanced technologies, including search, web and infrastructure computing services, digital content, and electronic devices, may increase our\ncompetition. The Internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping, and increased competition may reduce our sales and profits.\nOur Expansion Places a Significant Strain on our Management, Operational, Financial, and Other Resources\nWe are rapidly and significantly expanding our global operations, including increasing our product and service offerings and scaling our infrastructure to\nsupport our retail and services businesses. This expansion increases the complexity of our business and places significant strain on our management, personnel,\noperations, systems, technical performance, financial resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions. We may not be able to manage growth\neffectively, which could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results.\nOur Expansion into New Products, Services, Technologies, and Geographic Regions Subjects Us to Additional Business, Legal, Financial, and Competitive\nRisks\nWe may have limited or no experience in our newer market segments, and our customers may not adopt our new offerings.

If any of this were to occur, it could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating\nresults.\nWe May Experience Significant Fluctuations in Our Operating Results and Growth Rate\nWe may not be able to accurately forecast our growth rate.

For www.amazon.in, we provide certain marketing tools and logistics services\nto third-party sellers to enable them to sell online and deliver to customers, and we hold indirect minority interests in entities that are third-party sellers on the\nwww.amazon.in marketplace. Although we believe these structures and activities comply with existing laws, they involve unique risks, and the PRC is actively\nconsidering changes in its foreign investment rules that could impact these structures and activities.

Finally, foreign governments may enact\ntax laws in response to the 2017 Tax Act that could result in further changes to global taxation and materially affect our financial position and results of operations.\nThe 2017 Tax Act significantly changes how the U.S. taxes corporations. The 2017 Tax Act requires complex computations to be performed that were not\npreviously required in U.S. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the 2017 Tax Act and significant estimates in\ncalculations, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced.

We believe this decision\nto be without merit and will consider our legal options, including an appeal.

In addition, such contracts may provide for termination by\nthe government at any time, without cause.\nWe May Be Subject to Product Liability Claims if People or Property Are Harmed by the Products We Sell or Manufacture\nSome of the products we sell or manufacture may expose us to product liability or food safety claims relating to personal injury or illness, death, or\nenvironmental or property damage, and may require product recalls or other actions. Certain third parties also sell products using our e-commerce services that\nmay increase our exposure to product liability claims, such as if these sellers do not have sufficient protection from such claims. Although we maintain liability\ninsurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on\neconomically reasonable terms, or at all. In addition, some of our agreements with our vendors and sellers do not indemnify us from product liability.\nWe Are Subject to Payments-Related Risks\nWe accept payments using a variety of methods, including credit card, debit card, credit accounts (including promotional financing), gift cards, direct debit\nfrom a customer’s bank account, consumer invoicing, physical bank check, and payment upon delivery. For existing and future payment options we offer to our\ncustomers, we may become subject to additional regulations and compliance requirements (including obligations to implement enhanced authentication processes\nthat could result in significant costs and reduce the ease of use of our payments products), as well as fraud. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit\ncards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability. We rely on third parties to provide\ncertain Amazon-branded payment methods and payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, electronic checks, and\npromotional financing. In each case, it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us.

These risks\nand uncertainties, as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ significantly from management’s expectations, are described\nin greater detail in Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.”\nOverview\nOur primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers . The products offered through our consumer-facing\nwebsites and physical stores primarily include merchandise and content we have purchased for resale from vendors and products offered by third-party sellers, and\nwe also manufacture and sell electronic devices. Generally, we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory as product sales and recognize our\nnet share of revenue of items sold by third-party sellers as service sales. We seek to increase unit sales across our businesses, through increased product selection,\nacross numerous product categories. We also offer other services such as compute, storage, and database offerings, fulfillment, publishing, certain digital content\nsubscriptions, advertising, and co-branded credit cards.\nOur financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flows 1 . Free cash flows are driven primarily by increasing operating income and\nefficiently managing working capital 2 and cash capital expenditures, including our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment. Increases in operating\nincome primarily result from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs, partially offset by investments we make in\nlonger-term strategic initiatives. To increase sales of products and services, we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience, including lowering\nprices, improving availability, offering faster delivery and performance times, increasing selection, increasing product categories and service offerings, expanding\nproduct information, improving ease of use, improving reliability, and earning customer trust.\nWe seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs.

Variable costs\ngenerally change directly with sales volume, while fixed costs generally are dependent on the timing of capacity needs, geographic expansion, category expansion,\nand other factors. To decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers, we seek to increase our direct sourcing, increase\ndiscounts from suppliers, and reduce defects in our processes. To minimize growth in fixed costs, we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean\nculture.\n_______________________\n(1) See “Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for additional information on our non-GAAP free cash flows financial measures.\n(2) Working capital consists of accounts receivable, inventory, and accounts payable.\n19\n\n\nTable of Contents\nBecause of our model we are able to turn our inventory quickly and have a cash-generating operating cycle 3 . On average, our high inventory velocity\nmeans we generally collect from consumers before our payments to suppliers come due. We expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected\nby numerous factors, including our product mix, the mix of sales by us and by third-party sellers, our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability and\nselection of product offerings, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent to which we choose to utilize third-party fulfillment providers.\nWe also expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors, including the mix of product sales, the mix of sales\nby third-party sellers, the mix of suppliers, seasonality, and changes in payment terms over time, including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment\nterms with suppliers.\nWe expect spending in technology and content will increase over time as we add computer scientists, designers, software and hardware engineers, and\nmerchandising employees. Our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to\ngeographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations.

We utilize restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we\nbelieve this compensation model aligns the long-term interests of our shareholders and employees.

Likewise, if the U.S. Dollar strengthens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our\nconsolidated net sales and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant. We believe that our increasing diversification beyond the\nU.S. economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the long-term. We also believe it is useful to evaluate our operating\nresults and growth rates before and after the effect of currency changes.\nIn addition, the remeasurement of our intercompany balances can result in significant gains and losses associated with the effect of movements in foreign\ncurrency exchange rates.

The SEC has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the\nportrayal of the company’s financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often\nas a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and\njudgments addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to\nunderstanding our results. For additional information, see Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1—Description of Business and\nAccounting Policies.” Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available.\nActual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions.\nInventories\nInventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost and\nnet realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as\nthrough sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. These assumptions\nabout future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material write-downs in the\nfuture. As a measure of sensitivity, for every 1% of additional inventory valuation allowance as of December 31, 2017 , we would have recorded an additional cost\nof sales of approximately $180 million.\nIn addition, we enter into supplier commitments for certain electronic device components and certain products offered in our Whole Foods Market stores.\nThese commitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions.

In addition, a\nnumber of countries are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, such as the recently enacted U.S. tax reform legislation\ncommonly referred to as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “2017 Tax Act”). Finally, foreign governments may enact tax laws in response to the 2017\nTax Act that could result in further changes to global taxation and materially affect our financial position and results of operations.\nThe 2017 Tax Act significantly changes how the U.S. taxes corporations. The 2017 Tax Act requires complex computations to be performed that were not\npreviously required in U.S. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the 2017 Tax Act and significant estimates in\ncalculations, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. The U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other\nstandard-setting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the 2017 Tax Act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our\ninterpretation.

On March 23, 2017, the U.S. Tax Court issued its decision\nregarding the issues raised in the IRS NOPAs. The Tax Court rejected the approach from the IRS NOPAs in determining transfer pricing adjustments in 2005 and\n2006 for the transactions undertaken with our foreign subsidiaries and adopted, with adjustments, our suggested approach. On September 29, 2017, the IRS filed a\nnotice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. We will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. If the Tax Court decision were\nreversed on appeal or if the IRS were to successfully assert transfer pricing adjustments of a similar nature to the NOPAs for transactions in subsequent years, we\ncould be subject to significant additional tax liabilities. In addition, in October 2014, the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether\ndecisions by the tax authorities in Luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on\nstate aid. On October 4, 2017, the European Commission announced its decision that determinations by the tax authorities in Luxembourg did not comply with\nEuropean Union rules on state aid. This decision orders Luxembourg to calculate and recover additional taxes from us for the period May 2006 through June 2014.\nWe believe this decision to be without merit and will consider our legal options, including an appeal.

Our long-term debt is carried at\namortized cost and fluctuations in interest rates do not impact our consolidated financial statements. However, the fair value of our debt, which pays interest at a\nfixed rate, will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates\nof interest.

Such\nprocedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the\naccounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

We seek to be Earth’s most customer-centric company. In each of our segments,\nwe serve our primary customer sets, consisting of consumers, sellers, developers, enterprises, and content creators. We serve consumers through our retail websites\nand physical stores and focus on selection, price, and convenience. We also manufacture and sell electronic devices. We offer programs that enable sellers to sell\ntheir products on our websites and their own branded websites and to fulfill orders through us, and programs that allow authors, musicians, filmmakers, app\ndevelopers, and others to publish and sell content. We serve developers and enterprises of all sizes through our AWS segment, which offers a broad set of global\ncompute, storage, database, and other service offerings. In addition, we provide services, such as fulfillment, publishing, certain digital content subscriptions,\nadvertising, and co-branded credit cards.\nWe have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. See “Note 11—Segment Information.”\nPrior Period Reclassifications\nCertain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation, including the expanded presentation of “Net cash provided\nby (used in) investing activities” on our consolidated statements of cash flows and the allocation of stock-based compensation to “Other operating expense, net” in\nthe segment results within “Note 11 - Segment Information.” These revised segment results reflect the way our chief operating decision maker evaluates the\nCompany’s business performance and manages its operations. In addition, excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation were reclassified from “Net cash\nprovided by (used in) financing activities” to “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities” on our consolidated statements of cash flows as a result of the\nadoption of new accounting guidance.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Amazon.com, Inc., its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and those entities in which we have a\nvariable interest and of which we are the primary beneficiary, including certain entities in India and China and that support our seller lending financing activities\n(collectively, the “Company”). Intercompany balances and transactions between consolidated entities are eliminated. The financial results of Whole Foods Market,\nInc.

Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.\nEarnings per Share\nBasic earnings per share is calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common shares. Diluted earnings per share is calculated using our weighted-\naverage outstanding common shares including the dilutive effect of stock awards as determined under the treasury stock method. In periods when we have a net\nloss, stock awards are excluded from our calculation of earnings per share as their inclusion would have an antidilutive effect.\n42\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe following table shows the calculation of diluted shares (in millions):\n   \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2015\n2016\n2017\nShares used in computation of basic earnings per share\n467\n474\n480\nTotal dilutive effect of outstanding stock awards\n10\n10\n13\nShares used in computation of diluted earnings per share\n477\n484\n493\nRevenue\nWe recognize revenue from product sales or services rendered when the following four criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,\ndelivery has occurred or service has been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. Revenue arrangements with\nmultiple deliverables are divided into separate units and revenue is allocated using estimated selling prices if we do not have vendor-specific objective evidence or\nthird-party evidence of the selling prices of the deliverables. We allocate the arrangement price to each of the elements based on the relative selling prices of each\nelement. Estimated selling prices are management’s best estimates of the prices that we would charge our customers if we were to sell the standalone elements\nseparately and include considerations of customer demand, prices charged by us and others for similar deliverables, and the price if largely based on the cost of\nproducing the product or service.\nSales of certain of our digital devices are considered arrangements with multiple deliverables, consisting of the device, undelivered software upgrades and/or\nundelivered non-software services such as cloud services.

The revenue related to the deliverables is amortized over the life of the membership based on the\nestimated delivery of services. Amazon Prime membership fees are allocated between product sales and service sales. Costs to deliver Amazon Prime benefits are\nrecognized as cost of sales as incurred. As we add more benefits to the Prime membership, we update the method of determining the estimated selling prices of\neach element as well as the allocation of Prime membership fees.\nWe evaluate whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of product sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally,\nwhen we are primarily obligated in a transaction, are subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, or have several but not\nall of these indicators, revenue is recorded at the gross sale price. We generally record the net amounts as commissions earned if we are not primarily obligated and\ndo not have latitude in establishing prices. Such amounts earned are determined using fixed fees, a percentage of seller revenues, per-unit activity fees, or some\ncombination thereof.\nProduct sales represent revenue from the sale of products and related shipping fees and digital media content where we record revenue gross. Product sales\nand shipping revenues, net of promotional discounts, rebates, and return allowances, are recorded when the products are shipped and title passes to customers.\nRetail sales to customers are made pursuant to a sales contract that provides for transfer of both title and risk of loss upon our delivery to the carrier or the\ncustomer. Amazon’s electronic devices sold through retailers are recognized at the point of sale to consumers.\nService sales represent third-party seller fees earned (including commissions) and related shipping fees, AWS sales, certain digital content subscriptions,\ncertain advertising services, and our co-branded credit card agreements. Service sales, net of promotional discounts and return allowances, are recognized when\nservice has been rendered.\nReturn allowances, which reduce revenue and cost of sales, are estimated using historical experience.

Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory, and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of\nproducts to our customers. Payment processing and related transaction costs, including those associated with seller transactions, are classified in “Fulfillment” on\nour consolidated statements of operations.\nVendor Agreements\nWe have agreements with our vendors to receive funds for advertising services, cooperative marketing efforts, promotions, and volume rebates. We\ngenerally consider amounts received from vendors to be a reduction of the prices we pay for their goods, including property and equipment, or services, and\ntherefore record those amounts as a reduction of the cost of inventory, cost of services, or cost of property and equipment. Vendor rebates are typically dependent\nupon reaching minimum purchase thresholds. We evaluate the likelihood of reaching purchase thresholds using past experience and current year forecasts. When\nvolume rebates can be reasonably estimated, we record a portion of the rebate as we make progress towards the purchase threshold.\nWhen we receive direct reimbursements for costs incurred by us in advertising the vendor’s product or service, the amount we receive is recorded as an\noffset to “Marketing” on our consolidated statements of operations.\nFulfillment\nFulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International segments’ fulfillment centers,\ncustomer service centers, and physical stores, including costs attributable to buy",

Tax legislation commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the\n“2017 Tax Act”) includes a mandatory one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, and as a result, all previously unremitted earnings for which\nno U.S. deferred tax liability had been accrued have now been subject to U.S. tax. Notwithstanding the U.S. taxation of these amounts, we intend to continue to\ninvest most or all of these earnings, as well as our capital in these subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. and do not expect to incur any significant, additional\ntaxes related to such amounts.\nDeferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are\nstated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered.\nDeferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe they will not be realized. We consider\nmany factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent cumulative loss experience and expectations of\nfuture earnings, capital gains and investment in such jurisdiction, the carry-forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors.\nWe utilize a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain income tax positions (tax contingencies). The first step is to evaluate the tax position\nfor recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, includin",

We consider many factors when evaluating our tax positions and estimating our tax benefits, which may require periodic\nadjustments and which may not accurately forecast actual outcomes. We include interest and penalties related to our tax contingencies in income tax expense.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at\nthe measurement date. To increase the comparability of fair value measures, the following hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to\nmeasure fair value:\nLevel 1 —Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.\nLevel 2 —Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in\nactive markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be\ncorroborated by observable market data.\nLevel 3 —Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other\nmarket participants. These valuations require significant judgment.\n45\n\n\nTable of Contents\nFor our cash, cash equivalents, or marketable securities, we measure the fair value of money market funds and equity securities based on quoted prices in\nactive markets for identical assets or liabilities. All other financial instruments were valued either based on recent trades of securities in inactive markets or based\non quoted market prices of similar instruments and other significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. We did not hold any cash, cash\nequivalents, or marketable securities categorized as Level 3 assets as of December 31, 2016 and 2017 .\nAs part of entering into commercial agreements, we often obtain equity warrant assets giving us the right to acquire stock of other companies. As of\nDecember 31, 2016 and 2017 , these warrants had a fair value of $223 million and $441 million , and are recorded within “Other assets” on our consolidated\nbalance sheets. The related gain (loss) recorded in “Other income (expense), net” was $0 million , $67 million , and $109 million in 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 . These\nassets are primarily classified as Level 2 assets.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nWe classify all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents.\nInventories\nInventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in, first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost and\nnet realizable value.

Third-party sellers maintain ownership of their inventory,\nregardless of whether fulfillment is provided by us or the third-party sellers, and therefore these products are not included in our inventories.\nWe also purchase electronic device components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our\nproducts. During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate supply, we enter into agreements with\ncontract manufacturers and suppliers for certain electronic device components. A portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements\nconsists of firm, non-cancellable commitments. These commitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur\nadditional costs. We also have firm, non-cancellable commitments for certain products offered in our Whole Foods Market stores.\nAccounts Receivable, Net and Other\nIncluded in “Accounts receivable, net and other” on our consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to customers, sellers, and vendors.

Depreciation expense is classified\nwithin the corresponding operating expense categories on our consolidated statements of operations.\nLeases and Asset Retirement Obligations\nWe categorize leases at their inception as either operating or capital leases. On certain of our lease agreements, we may receive rent holidays and other\nincentives. We recognize lease costs on a straight-line basis without regard to deferred payment terms, such as rent holidays, that defer the commencement date of\nrequired payments. Additionally, incentives we receive are treated as a reduction of our costs over the term of the agreement. Leasehold improvements are\ncapitalized at cost and amortized over the lesser of their expected useful life or the non-cancellable term of the lease.\nWe establish assets and liabilities for the estimated construction costs incurred under build-to-suit lease arrangements to the extent we are involved in the\nconstruction of structural improvements or take construction risk prior to commencement of a lease. Upon occupancy of facilities under build-to-suit leases, we\nassess whether these arrangements qualify for sales recognition under the sale-leaseback accounting guidance.

In testing goodwill for impairment, we may elect to utilize a qualitative assessment to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of\na reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If our qualitative assessment indicates that goodwill impairment is more likely than not, we perform a two-step\nimpairment test. We test goodwill for impairment under the two-step impairment test by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the\nreporting units. If the fair value is determined to be less than the book value or qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired, a\nsecond step is performed to compute the amount of impairment as the difference between the estimated fair value of goodwill and the carrying value. We estimate\nthe fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating\nexpenses, based primarily on expected category expansion, pricing, market segment share, and general economic conditions.\nWe completed the required annual testing of goodwill for impairment for all reporting units as of April 1, 2017, and determined that goodwill is no t\nimpaired as the fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeded their book value.

The ASU defines\nnet realizable value as the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation.\nThe ASU is applicable to inventory that is accounted for under the first-in, first-out method. We adopted this ASU in Q1 2017 with no material impact to our\nconsolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued an ASU amending the accounting for stock-based compensation and requiring excess tax benefits and deficiencies to be\nrecognized as a component of income tax expense rather than equity. The inclusion of excess tax benefits and deficiencies as a component of our income tax\nexpense will increase volatility within our provision for income taxes as the amount of excess tax benefits or deficiencies from stock-based compensation awards\ndepends on our stock price at the date the awards vest. This guidance also requires excess tax benefits to be presented as an operating activity on the statement of\ncash flows and allows an entity to make an accounting policy election to either estimate expected forfeitures or to account for them as they occur. We adopted this\nASU in Q1 2017 by recording the cumulative impact through an increase in retained earnings of $687 million , and we will continue to estimate expected\nforfeitures. Additionally, we retrospectively adjusted our consolidated statements of cash flows to reclassify excess tax benefits of $119 million and $829 million\nfor the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2016 from financing activities to operating activities.\nAccounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn May 20",

The cumulative adjustment will primarily relate to unredeemed gift cards.

For buildings under build-to-suit lease arrangements where we have taken occupancy, which do not\nqualify for sales recognition under the sale-leaseback accounting guidance, we determined that we continue to be the deemed owner of these buildings.

The Tax Court rejected the approach from the IRS NOPAs in determining transfer pricing adjustments in 2005 and 2006 for the\ntransactions undertaken with our foreign subsidiaries and adopted, with adjustments, our suggested approach.

In December 2017, we settled this dispute with the FTA and included the impact thereof within our financial statements. In addition, in October 2014, the\nEuropean Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in Luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax\npaid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid. On October 4, 2017, the European Commission announced its decision that\ndeterminations by the tax authorities in Luxembourg did not comply with European Union rules on state aid. This decision orders Luxembourg to calculate and\nrecover additional taxes from us for the period May 2006 through June 2014. We believe this decision to be without merit and will consider our legal options,\nincluding an appeal. In December 2017, Luxembourg appealed the European Commission’s decision. While the European Commission announced an estimated\nrecovery amount of approximately  €250 million , plus interest, the actual amount of additional taxes subject to recovery is to be calculated by the Luxembourg tax\nauthorities in accordance with the European Commission’s guidance. Once the recovery amount is computed by Luxembourg, we anticipate funding it, including\ninterest, into escrow, where it will remain pending conclusion of all appeals. We may be required to fund into escrow an amount in excess of the estimated\nrecovery amount announced by the European Commission.

In addition, changes in state, federal, and foreign tax laws may increase our tax\ncontingencies. The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain, and the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues\nraised by the taxing authorities may differ from the amounts accrued. It is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months we will receive additional\nassessments by various tax authorities or possibly reach resolution of income tax examinations in one or more jurisdictions.

Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and\nevaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary\nin the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting\nand the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of\nfinancial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of\nunauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with\nthe policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nSeattle, Washington\nFebruary 1, 2018\n74\n\n\nTable of Contents\nItem 9B.\nOther Information\nDisclosure Pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act\nWe determined that, between January 2012 and December 2017, we processed and delivered orders of consumer products for cer",

Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longer\nhistories, more customers, and/or greater brand recognition, particularly with our newly-launched products and services and in our newer geographic regions. They\nmay secure better terms from vendors, adopt more aggressive pricing, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing.\nCompetition may intensify, including with the development of new business models and the entry of new and well-funded competitors, and as our\ncompetitors enter into business combinations or alliances and established companies in other market segments expand to become competitive with our business. In\naddition, new and enhanced technologies, including search, web and infrastructure computing services, digital content, and electronic devices, may increase our\ncompetition. The Internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping, and increased competition may reduce our sales and profits.\nOur Expansion Places a Significant Strain on our Management, Operational, Financial, and Other Resources\nWe are rapidly and significantly expanding our global operations, including increasing our product and service offerings and scaling our infrastructure to\nsupport our retail and services businesses. This expansion increases the complexity of our business and places significant strain on our management, personnel,\noperations, systems, technical performance, financial resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions.

If any of this were to occur, it could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating\nresults.\nWe May Experience Significant Fluctuations in Our Operating Results and Growth Rate\nWe may not be able to accurately forecast our growth rate. We base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates. A significant portion of our\nexpenses and investments is fixed, and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected.\nOur revenue growth may not be sustainable, and our percentage growth rates may decrease.

In certain international market segments,\nwe have relatively little operating experience and may not benefit from any first-to-market advantages or otherwise succeed. It is costly to establish, develop, and\nmaintain international operations and websites, and promote our brand internationally. Our international operations may not be profitable on a sustained basis.\nIn addition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks, including:\n•\nlocal economic and political conditions;\n•\ngovernment regulation of e-commerce and other services, electronic devices, and competition, and restrictive governmental actions (such as trade\nprotection measures, including export duties and quotas and custom duties and tariffs), nationalization, and restrictions on foreign ownership;\n•\nrestrictions on sales or distribution of certain products or services and uncertainty regarding liability for products, services, and content, including\nuncertainty as a result of less Internet-friendly legal systems, local laws, lack of legal precedent, and varying rules, regulations, and practices regarding\nthe physical and digital distribution of media products and enforcement of intellectual property rights;\n•\nbusiness licensing or certification requirements, such as for imports, exports, web services, and electronic devices;\n•\nlimitations on the repatriation and investment of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions;\n•\nlimited fulfillment and technology infrastructure;\n•\nshorter payable and longer receivable cycles and the resultant negative impact on cash flow;\n•\nlaws and regulations regarding consumer and data protection, privacy, network security, encryption, payments, and restrictions on pricing or discounts;\n•\nlower levels of use of the Internet;\n•\nlower levels of consumer spending and fewer opportunities for growth compared to the U.S.;\n•\nlower levels of credit card usage and increased payment risk;\n•\ndifficulty in staffing, developing, and managing foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural differences;\n•\ndifferent employee/employer relationships and the existence of works councils and labor unions;\n7\n\n\nTable of Contents",

We may not be able to\nhire, train, retain, and manage required personnel, which may limit our international growth.\nThe People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) and India regulate Amazon’s and its affiliates’ businesses and operations in country through regulations and license\nrequirements that may restrict (i) foreign investment in and operation of the Internet, IT infrastructure, data centers, retail, delivery, and other sectors, (ii) Internet\ncontent, and (iii) the sale of media and other products and services. For example, in order to meet local ownership and regulatory licensing requirements,\nwww.amazon.cn is operated by PRC companies that are indirectly owned, either wholly or partially, by PRC nationals. In addition, we provide certain technology\nservices in China in conjunction with third parties that hold PRC licenses to provide services. In India, the government restricts the ownership or control of Indian\ncompanies by foreign entities involved in online multi-brand retail trading activities. For www.amazon.in, we provide certain marketing tools and logistics services\nto third-party sellers to enable them to sell online and deliver to customers, and we hold indirect minority interests in entities that are third-party sellers on the\nwww.amazon.in marketplace. Although we believe these structures and activities comply with existing laws, they involve unique risks, and the PRC is actively\nconsidering changes in its foreign investment rules that could impact these structures and activities. There are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation\nof PRC and Indian laws and regulations, and it is possible that these governments will ultimately take a view contrary to ours. In addition, our Chinese and Indian\nbusinesses and operations may be unable to continue to operate if we or our affiliates are unable to access sufficient funding or in China enforce contractual\nrelationships with respect to management and control of such businesses. If our international activities were found to be in violation of any existing or future PRC,\nIndian or other laws or regulations or if interpretations of those laws and regulations were to change, our businesses in those countries could be subject to fines and\nother financial penalties, have licenses revoked, or be forced to shut down entirely.\nIf We Do Not Successful",

As we\ncontinue to add fulfillment and data center capability or add new businesses with different requirements, our fulfillment and data center networks become\nincreasingly complex and operating them becomes more challenging. There can be no assurance that we will be able to operate our networks effectively.\nIn addition, a failure to optimize inventory in our fulfillment network will increase our net shipping cost by requiring long-zone or partial shipments.

If the other businesses on whose behalf we perform\ninventory fulfillment services deliver product to our fulfillment centers in excess of forecasts, we may be unable to secure sufficient storage space and may be\nunable to optimize our fulfillment network.\nWe rely on a limited number of shipping companies to deliver inventory to us and completed orders to our customers.

If the U.S. Dollar\nstrengthens compared to these currencies, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, when translated, may be materially less than expected and vice\nversa.\nThe Loss of Key Senior Management Personnel Could Negatively Affect Our Business\nWe depend on our senior management and other key personnel, particularly Jeffrey P. Bezos, our President, CEO, and Chairman. We do not have “key\nperson” life insurance policies. The loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees could harm our business.\nWe Could Be Harmed by Data Loss or Other Security Breaches\nAs a result of our services being web-based and the fact that we process, store, and transmit large amounts of data, including personal information, for our\ncustomers, failure to prevent or mitigate data loss or other security breaches, including breaches of our vendors’ technology and systems, could expose us or our\ncustomers to a risk of loss or misuse of such information, adversely affect our operating results, result in litigation or potential liability for us, and otherwise harm\nour business. We use third-party technology and systems for a variety of reasons, including, without limitation, encryption and authentication technology,\nemployee email, content delivery to customers, back-office support, and other functions. Some subsidiaries had past security breaches, and, although they did not\nhave a material adverse effect on our operating results, there can be no assurance of a similar result in the future.

If we are\nunable to continually add software and hardware, effectively upgrade our systems and network infrastructure, and take other steps to improve the efficiency of our\nsystems, it could cause system interruptions or delays and adversely affect our operating results.\nOur computer and communications systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure,\nearthquakes, acts of war or terrorism, acts of God, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, and similar events or disruptions. Any of these events could\ncause system interruption, delays, and loss of critical data, and could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders and providing services, which could\nmake our product and service offerings less attractive and subject us to liability. Our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be\nsufficient. In addition, we may have inadequate insurance coverage to compensate for any related losses. Any of these events could damage our reputation and be\nexpensive to remedy.\nWe Face Significant Inventory Risk\nIn addition to risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A relating to fulfillment network and inventory optimization by us and third parties, we are exposed to\nsignificant inventory risks that may adversely affect our operating results as a result of seasonality, new product launches, rapid changes in product cycles and\npricing, defective merchandise, changes in consumer demand and consumer spending patterns, changes in consumer tastes with respect to our products, spoilage,\nand other factors. We endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking products we manufacture and/or sell. Demand for\nproducts, however, can change significantly between the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of sale. In addition, when we begin selling or\nmanufacturing a new product, it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships, determine appropriate product or component selection, and accurately forecast\ndemand. The acquisition of certain types of inventory or components may require significant lead-time and prepayment and they may not be returnable. We carry a\nbroad selection and significant inventory levels of certain products, such as consumer electronics, and we may be unable to sell products in sufficient quantit",

Effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and\nservices are made available.

Third parties that license our proprietary rights also\nmay take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or reputation. The protection of our intellectual property may require the expenditure of\nsignificant financial and managerial resources. Moreover, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not adequately protect our rights or prevent\nthird parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights. We also cannot be certain that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire\nequivalent or superior technology or other intellectual property rights.\nOther parties also may claim that we infringe their proprietary rights. We have been subject to, and expect to continue to be subject to, claims and legal\nproceedings regarding alleged infringement by us of the intellectual property rights of third parties. Such claims, whether or not meritorious, may result in the\nexpenditure of significant financial and managerial resources, injunctions against us, or the payment of damages, including to satisfy indemnification obligations.\nWe may need to obtain licenses from third parties who allege that we have infringed their rights, but such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us\nor at all. In addition, we may not be able to obtain or utilize on terms that are favorable to us, or at all, licenses or other rights with respect to intellectual property\nwe do not own.

We may not have sufficient lead time to build systems and processes to collect these taxes properly,\nor at all. Failure to comply with such laws or administrative practices, or a successful assertion by such states or foreign jurisdictions requiring us to collect taxes\nwhere we do not, could result in substantial tax liabilities, including for past sales, as well as penalties and interest. In addition, if the tax authorities in jurisdictions\nwhere we are already subject to sales tax or other indirect tax obligations were successfully to challenge our positions, our tax liability could increase substantially.\nIn the U.S., although Supreme Court decisions restrict states’ rights to require remote sellers to collect state and local sales taxes, the Supreme Court has recently\nagreed to hear a case that could overturn prior precedent. We support a federal law that would allow states to require sales tax collection by remote sellers under a\nnationwide system.\nWe are also subject to U.S. (federal and state) and foreign laws, regulations, and administrative practices that require us to collect information from our\ncustomers, vendors, merchants, and other third parties for tax reporting purposes and report such information to various government agencies.

Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result\nin significant penalties.\nWe Could Be Subject to Additional Income Tax Liabilities\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, and administrative practices in\nvarious jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, with or without notice, due to economic, political, and other conditions, and significant judgment is\nrequired in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes.

In addition, a number of countries are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, such as the recently\nenacted U.S. tax reform legislation commonly referred to as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “2017 Tax Act”). Finally, foreign governments may enact\ntax laws in response to the 2017 Tax Act that could result in further changes to global taxation and materially affect our financial position and results of operations.\nThe 2017 Tax Act significantly changes how the U.S. taxes corporations. The 2017 Tax Act requires complex computations to be performed that were not\npreviously required in U.S. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the 2017 Tax Act and significant estimates in\ncalculations, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. The U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other\nstandard-setting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the 2017 Tax Act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our\ninterpretation. As we complete our analysis of the 2017 Tax Act, collect and prepare necessary data, and interpret any additional guidance, we may make\nadjustments to provisional amounts that we have recorded that may materially impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are\nmade.\nWe are also currently subject to audit in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us. Developments in\nan audit, litigation, or the relevant laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations could have a material effect on our operating results or\ncash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. For instance, we have received Notices of\nProposed Adjustment (“NOPAs”) from the IRS for transactions undertaken in the 2005 and 2006 calendar years relating to transfer pricing with our foreign\nsubsidiaries and we have been contesting the matter in U.S. Tax Court. On March 23, 2017, the U.S. Tax Court issued its decision regarding the issues raised in the\nIRS NOPAs. The Tax Court rejected the approach from the IRS NOPAs in determining transfer pricing adjustments in 2005 and 2006 for the transactions\nundertaken with our foreign subsidiaries a",

If the Tax Court decision were reversed on appeal or if\nthe IRS were to successfully assert transfer pricing adjustments of a similar nature to the NOPAs for transactions in subsequent years, we could be subject to\nsignificant additional tax liabilities. In addition, in October 2014, the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax\nauthorities in Luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid. On October\n4, 2017, the European Commission announced its decision that determinations by the tax authorities in Luxembourg did not comply with European Union rules on\nstate aid. This decision orders Luxembourg to calculate and recover additional taxes from us for the period May 2006 through June 2014. We believe this decision\nto be without merit and will consider our legal options, including an appeal. In December 2017, Luxembourg appealed the European Commission’s decision.\nWhile the European Commission announced an estimated recovery amount of approximately €250 million, plus interest, the actual amount of additional taxes\nsubject to recovery is to be calculated by the Luxembourg tax authorities in accordance with the European Commission’s guidance. Although we believe our tax\nestimates are reasonable, the final outcome of tax audits, investigations, and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax\nprovisions and accruals.\nOur Supplier Relationships Subject Us to a Number of Risks\nWe have significant suppliers, including licensors, and in some cases, limited or single-sources of supply, that are important to our sourcing, services,\nmanufacturing, and any related ongoing servicing of merchandise and content.

Certain third parties also sell products using our e-commerce services that\nmay increase our exposure to product liability claims, such as if these sellers do not have sufficient protection from such claims.

The products offered through our consumer-facing\nwebsites and physical stores primarily include merchandise and content we have purchased for resale from vendors and products offered by third-party sellers, and\nwe also manufacture and sell electronic devices. Generally, we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory as product sales and recognize our\nnet share of revenue of items sold by third-party sellers as service sales. We seek to increase unit sales across our businesses, through increased product selection,\nacross numerous product categories. We also offer other services such as compute, storage, and database offerings, fulfillment, publishing, certain digital content\nsubscriptions, advertising, and co-branded credit cards.\nOur financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flows 1 . Free cash flows are driven primarily by increasing operating income and\nefficiently managing working capital 2 and cash capital expenditures, including our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment. Increases in operating\nincome primarily result from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs, partially offset by investments we make in\nlonger-term strategic initiatives. To increase sales of products and services, we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience, including lowering\nprices, improving availability, offering faster delivery and performance times, increasing selection, increasing product categories and service offerings, expanding\nproduct information, improving ease of use, improving reliability, and earning customer trust.\nWe seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs.

Variable costs\ngenerally change directly with sales volume, while fixed costs generally are dependent on the timing of capacity needs, geographic expansion, category expansion,\nand other factors. To decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers, we seek to increase our direct sourcing, increase\ndiscounts from suppliers, and reduce defects in our processes.

On average, our high inventory velocity\nmeans we generally collect from consumers before our payments to suppliers come due. We expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected\nby numerous factors, including our product mix, the mix of sales by us and by third-party sellers, our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability and\nselection of product offerings, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent to which we choose to utilize third-party fulfillment providers.\nWe also expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors, including the mix of product sales, the mix of sales\nby third-party sellers, the mix of suppliers, seasonality, and changes in payment terms over time, including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment\nterms with suppliers.\nWe expect spending in technology and content will increase over time as we add computer scientists, designers, software and hardware engineers, and\nmerchandising employees. Our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to\ngeographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations.

We believe that advances in technology, specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power and the advances of wireless\nconnectivity, will continue to improve the consumer experience on the Internet and increase its ubiquity in people’s lives. To best take advantage of these\ncontinued advances in technology, we are investing in initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices. We are also\ninvesting in AWS, which offers a broad set of global compute, storage, database, and other service offerings to developers and enterprises of all sizes.\nWe seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes, such as financings, acquisitions,\nand aligning employee compensation with shareholders’ interests. We utilize restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we\nbelieve this compensation model aligns the long-term interests of our shareholders and employees. In measuring shareholder dilution, we include all vested and\nunvested stock awards outstanding, without regard to estimated forfeitures.

Likewise, if the U.S. Dollar strengthens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our\nconsolidated net sales and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant.

We also believe it is useful to evaluate our operating\nresults and growth rates before and after the effect of currency changes.\nIn addition, the remeasurement of our intercompany balances can result in significant gains and losses associated with the effect of movements in foreign\ncurrency exchange rates.

The SEC has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the\nportrayal of the company’s financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often\nas a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and\njudgments addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to\nunderstanding our results. For additional information, see Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1—Description of Business and\nAccounting Policies.” Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available.\nActual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions.\nInventories\nInventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost and\nnet realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as\nthrough sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. These assumptions\nabout future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material write-downs in the\nfuture. As a measure of sensitivity, for every 1% of additional inventory valuation allowance as of December 31, 2017 , we would have recorded an additional cost\nof sales of approximately $180 million.\nIn addition, we enter into supplier commitments for certain electronic device components and certain products offered in our Whole Foods Market stores.\nThese commitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, and administrative practices in\nvarious jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, with or without notice, due to economic, political, and other conditions, and significant judgment is\nrequired in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes.

In addition, a\nnumber of countries are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, such as the recently enacted U.S. tax reform legislation\ncommonly referred to as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “2017 Tax Act”). Finally, foreign governments may enact tax laws in response to the 2017\nTax Act that could result in further changes to global taxation and materially affect our financial position and results of operations.\nThe 2017 Tax Act significantly changes how the U.S. taxes corporations. The 2017 Tax Act requires complex computations to be performed that were not\npreviously required in U.S. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the 2017 Tax Act and significant estimates in\ncalculations, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. The U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other\nstandard-setting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the 2017 Tax Act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our\ninterpretation.

On March 23, 2017, the U.S. Tax Court issued its decision\nregarding the issues raised in the IRS NOPAs. The Tax Court rejected the approach from the IRS NOPAs in determining transfer pricing adjustments in 2005 and\n2006 for the transactions undertaken with our foreign subsidiaries and adopted, with adjustments, our suggested approach. On September 29, 2017, the IRS filed a\nnotice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. We will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. If the Tax Court decision were\nreversed on appeal or if the IRS were to successfully assert transfer pricing adjustments of a similar nature to the NOPAs for transactions in subsequent years, we\ncould be subject to significant additional tax liabilities. In addition, in October 2014, the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether\ndecisions by the tax authorities in Luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on\nstate aid. On October 4, 2017, the European Commission announced its decision that determinations by the tax authorities in Luxembourg did not comply with\nEuropean Union rules on state aid.

In December 2017, Luxembourg appealed the European\nCommission’s decision. While the European Commission announced an estimated recovery amount of approximately €250 million, plus interest, the actual amount\nof additional taxes subject to recovery is to be calculated by the Luxembourg tax authorities in accordance with the European Commission’s guidance.

We may be required to fund into escrow an amount in excess of the estimated recovery amount announced by the European Commission.\nOur liquidity is also affected by restricted cash balances that are pledged as collateral for real estate leases, workers’ compensation obligations, amounts due\nto third-party sellers in certain jurisdictions, debt, and standby and trade letters of credit. To the extent we process payments for third-party sellers or offer certain\ntypes of stored value to our customers, some jurisdictions may restrict our use of those funds. These restrictions would result in the reclassification of a portion of\nour cash and cash equivalents from “Cash and cash equivalents” to restricted cash, which is classified within “Accounts receivable, net and other” on our\nconsolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2016 and 2017 , restricted cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $600 million and $1.3 billion .\nSee Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\n23\n\n\nTable of Contents\n—Note 7—Commitments and Contingencies” for additional discussion of our principal contractual commitments, as well as ou",

These segments reflect the way the Company evaluates its business performance and manages its operations. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial\nStatements and Supplementary Data—Note 11—Segment Information.”\nNet Sales\nNet sales include product and service sales. Product sales represent revenue from the sale of products and related shipping fees and digital media content\nwhere we record revenue gross. Service sales represent third-party seller fees earned (including commissions) and related shipping fees, AWS sales, certain digital\ncontent subscriptions, certain advertising services, and our co-branded credit card agreements. Amazon Prime membership fees are allocated between product sales\nand service sales and amortized over the life of the membership according to the estimated delivery of services.

Our long-term debt is carried at\namortized cost and fluctuations in interest rates do not impact our consolidated financial statements. However, the fair value of our debt, which pays interest at a\nfixed rate, will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates\nof interest. All of our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities are designated as available-for-sale and, accordingly, are presented at fair value on\nour consolidated balance sheets. We generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities and AAA-rated\nmoney market funds. Fixed income securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, and we may suffer losses in\nprincipal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates.\nThe following table provides information about our cash equivalents and marketable fixed income securities, including principal cash flows by expected\nmaturity and the related weighted-average interest rates as of December 31, 2017 (in millions, except percentages):\n \n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\nThereafter\nTotal\nEstimated Fair\nValue as of\nDecember 31,\n2017\nMoney market funds\n$\n11,343\n$\n—\n$\n—\n$\n—\n$\n—\n$\n—\n$\n11,343\n$\n11,343\nWeighted-average interest rate\n0.61%\n0.61%\nCorporate debt securities\n2,717\n868\n484\n155\n25\n—\n4,249\n4,257\nWeighted-average interest rate\n1.79%\n2.10%\n2.27%\n2.23%\n2.00%\n1.93%\nU.S. government and agency securities\n2,995\n1,476\n310\n54\n1\n—\n4,836\n4,823\nWeighted-average interest rate\n1.49%\n1.98%\n2.06%\n2.41%\n2.64%\n1.69%\nAsset backed securities\n341\n273\n262\n31\n—\n—\n907\n905\nWeighted-average interest rate\n1.86%\n2.29%\n2.24%\n2.05%\n2.11%\nForeign government and agency\nsecurities\n405\n216\n—\n—\n—\n—\n621\n620\nWeighted-average interest rate\n1.75%\n1.93%\n1.81%\nOther securities\n159\n99\n43\n31\n—\n—\n332\n338\nWeighted-average interest rate\n1.15%\n1.84%\n2.24%\n2.48%\n1.62%\n$\n17,960\n$\n2,932\n$\n1,099\n$\n271\n$\n26\n$\n—\n$\n22,288\nCash equivalent and marketable",

Net sales and related expenses generated from our\ninternationally-focused websites, and from www.amazon.ca and www.amazon.com.mx (which are included in our North America segment), are primarily\ndenominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding websites and primarily include Euros, Japanese Yen, and British Pounds. The results of operations\nof, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our internationally-focused websites and AWS are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations.\nUpon consolidation, as foreign exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant\ngains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. For example, as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates throughout the period compared\nto rates in effect the prior year, International segment net sales increased by $137 million in comparison with the prior year.\nWe have foreign exchange risk related to foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (“foreign funds”). Based on the balance of\nforeign funds as of December 31, 2017 , of $11.1 billion , an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in fair value declines of\n$555 million, $1.1 billion, and $2.2 billion. All investments are classified as “available-for-sale.” Fluctuations in fair value are recorded in “Accumulated other\ncomprehensive loss,” a separate component of stockholders’ equity.\nWe have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in various foreign currencies. Based on the intercompany balances as of\nDecember 31, 2017 , an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in losses of $280 million, $600 million, and $1.3 billion,\nrecorded to “Other income (expense), net.”\nSee Item 7 of Part I",

We seek to be Earth’s most customer-centric company. In each of our segments,\nwe serve our primary customer sets, consisting of consumers, sellers, developers, enterprises, and content creators. We serve consumers through our retail websites\nand physical stores and focus on selection, price, and convenience. We also manufacture and sell electronic devices. We offer programs that enable sellers to sell\ntheir products on our websites and their own branded websites and to fulfill orders through us, and programs that allow authors, musicians, filmmakers, app\ndevelopers, and others to publish and sell content. We serve developers and enterprises of all sizes through our AWS segment, which offers a broad set of global\ncompute, storage, database, and other service offerings. In addition, we provide services, such as fulfillment, publishing, certain digital content subscriptions,\nadvertising, and co-branded credit cards.\nWe have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. See “Note 11—Segment Information.”\nPrior Period Reclassifications\nCertain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation, including the expanded presentation of “Net cash provided\nby (used in) investing activities” on our consolidated statements of cash flows and the allocation of stock-based compensation to “Other operating expense, net” in\nthe segment results within “Note 11 - Segment Information.” These revised segment results reflect the way our chief operating decision maker evaluates the\nCompany’s business performance and manages its operations. In addition, excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation were reclassified from “Net cash\nprovided by (used in) financing activities” to “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities” on our consolidated statements of cash flows as a result of the\nadoption of new accounting guidance.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Amazon.com, Inc., its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and those entities in which we have a\nvariable interest and of which we are the primary beneficiary, including certain entities in India and China and that support our seller lending financing activities\n(collectively, the “Company”). Intercompany balances and transactions between consolidated entities are eliminated. The financial results of Whole Foods Market,\nInc. (“Whole Foods Market”) have been included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition on August 28, 2017.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumpti",

Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.\nEarnings per Share\nBasic earnings per share is calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common shares. Diluted earnings per share is calculated using our weighted-\naverage outstanding common shares including the dilutive effect of stock awards as determined under the treasury stock method. In periods when we have a net\nloss, stock awards are excluded from our calculation of earnings per share as their inclusion would have an antidilutive effect.\n42\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe following table shows the calculation of diluted shares (in millions):\n   \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2015\n2016\n2017\nShares used in computation of basic earnings per share\n467\n474\n480\nTotal dilutive effect of outstanding stock awards\n10\n10\n13\nShares used in computation of diluted earnings per share\n477\n484\n493\nRevenue\nWe recognize revenue from product sales or services rendered when the following four criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,\ndelivery has occurred or service has been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. Revenue arrangements with\nmultiple deliverables are divided into separate units and revenue is allocated using estimated selling prices if we do not have vendor-specific objective evidence or\nthird-party evidence of the selling prices of the deliverables. We allocate the arrangement price to each of the elements based on the relative selling prices of each\nelement. Estimated selling prices are management’s best estimates of the prices that we would charge our customers if we were to sell the standalone elements\nseparately and include considerations of customer demand, prices charged by us and others for similar deliverables, and the price if largely based on the cost of\nproducing the product or service.\nSales of certain of our digital devices are considered arrangements with multiple deliverables, consisting of the device, undelivered software upgrades and/or\nundelivered non-software services such as cloud services.

The revenue related to the deliverables is amortized over the life of the membership based on the\nestimated delivery of services. Amazon Prime membership fees are allocated between product sales and service sales. Costs to deliver Amazon Prime benefits are\nrecognized as cost of sales as incurred. As we add more benefits to the Prime membership, we update the method of determining the estimated selling prices of\neach element as well as the allocation of Prime membership fees.\nWe evaluate whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of product sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally,\nwhen we are primarily obligated in a transaction, are subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, or have several but not\nall of these indicators, revenue is recorded at the gross sale price. We generally record the net amounts as commissions earned if we are not primarily obligated and\ndo not have latitude in establishing prices. Such amounts earned are determined using fixed fees, a percentage of seller revenues, per-unit activity fees, or some\ncombination thereof.\nProduct sales represent revenue from the sale of products and related shipping fees and digital media content where we record revenue gross. Product sales\nand shipping revenues, net of promotional discounts, rebates, and return allowances, are recorded when the products are shipped and title passes to customers.\nRetail sales to customers are made pursuant to a sales contract that provides for transfer of both title and risk of loss upon our delivery to the carrier or the\ncustomer. Amazon’s electronic devices sold through retailers are recognized at the point of sale to consumers.\nService sales represent third-party seller fees earned (including commissions) and related shipping fees, AWS sales, certain digital content subscriptions,\ncertain advertising services, and our co-branded credit card agreements.

We\ngenerally consider amounts received from vendors to be a reduction of the prices we pay for their goods, including property and equipment, or services, and\ntherefore record those amounts as a reduction of the cost of inventory, cost of services, or cost of property and equipment. Vendor rebates are typically dependent\nupon reaching minimum purchase thresholds. We evaluate the likelihood of reaching purchase thresholds using past experience and current year forecasts. When\nvolume rebates can be reasonably estimated, we record a portion of the rebate as we make progress towards the purchase threshold.\nWhen we receive direct reimbursements for costs incurred by us in advertising the vendor’s product or service, the amount we receive is recorded as an\noffset to “Marketing” on our consolidated statements of operations.\nFulfillment\nFulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International segments’ fulfillment centers,\ncustomer service centers, and physical stores, including costs attributable to buy",

We consider many factors when\nestimating expected forfeitures, including employee level, economic conditions, time remaining to vest, and historical forfeiture experience.\nOther Operating Expense, Net\nOther operating expense, net, consists primarily of marketing-related, contract-based, and customer-related intangible asset amortization expense, and\nexpenses related to legal settlements.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net, consists primarily of foreign currency gains (losses) of $(266) million , $21 million , and $247 million in 2015 , 2016 , and\n2017 , equity warrant valuation gains (losses) of $0 million , $67 million , and $109 million in 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 , and realized gains (losses) on marketable\nsecurities sales of $(5) million , $(8) million , and $(7) million in 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 .\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense includes U.S. (federal and state) and foreign income taxes. Tax legislation commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the\n“2017 Tax Act”) includes a mandatory one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, and as a result, all previously unremitted earnings for which\nno U.S. deferred tax liability had been accrued have now been subject to U.S. tax. Notwithstanding the U.S. taxation of these amounts, we intend to continue to\ninvest most or all of these earnings, as well as our capital in these subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. and do not expect to incur any significant, additional\ntaxes related to such amounts.\nDeferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are\nstated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered.\nDeferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe they will not be realized. We consider\nmany factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent cumulative loss experience and expectations of\nfuture earnings, capital gains and investment in such jurisdiction, the carry-forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors.\nWe utilize a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain income tax positions (tax contingencies).

We consider many factors when evaluating our tax positions and estimating our tax benefits, which may require periodic\nadjustments and which may not accurately forecast actual outcomes. We include interest and penalties related to our tax contingencies in income tax expense.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at\nthe measurement date. To increase the comparability of fair value measures, the following hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to\nmeasure fair value:\nLevel 1 —Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.\nLevel 2 —Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in\nactive markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be\ncorroborated by observable market data.\nLevel 3 —Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other\nmarket participants. These valuations require significant judgment.\n45\n\n\nTable of Contents\nFor our cash, cash equivalents, or marketable securities, we measure the fair value of money market funds and equity securities based on quoted prices in\nactive markets for identical assets or liabilities. All other financial instruments were valued either based on recent trades of securities in inactive markets or based\non quoted market prices of similar instruments and other significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. We did not hold any cash, cash\nequivalents, or marketable securities categorized as Level 3 assets as of December 31, 2016 and 2017 .\nAs part of entering into commercial agreements, we often obtain equity warrant assets giving us the right to acquire stock of other companies. As of\nDecember 31, 2016 and 2017 , these warrants had a fair value of $223 million and $441 million , and are recorded within “Other assets” on our consolidated\nbalance sheets. The related gain (loss) recorded in “Other income (expense), net” was $0 million , $67 million , and $109 million in 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 . These\nassets are primarily classified as Level 2 assets.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nWe classify all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents.\nInventories\nInventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in, first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost and\nnet realizable value.

Third-party sellers maintain ownership of their inventory,\nregardless of whether fulfillment is provided by us or the third-party sellers, and therefore these products are not included in our inventories.\nWe also purchase electronic device components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our\nproducts. During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate supply, we enter into agreements with\ncontract manufacturers and suppliers for certain electronic device components. A portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements\nconsists of firm, non-cancellable commitments. These commitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur\nadditional costs.

Equipment includes assets such as furniture and fixtures, heavy equipment,\nservers and networking equipment, and internal-use software and website development. Depreciation is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful\nlives of the assets (generally the lesser of 40 years or the remaining life of the underlying building, two years for assets such as internal-use software, three years\nfor our servers, five years for networking equipment, five years for furniture and fixtures, and ten years for heavy equipment). Depreciation expense is classified\nwithin the corresponding operating expense categories on our consolidated statements of operations.\nLeases and Asset Retirement Obligations\nWe categorize leases at their inception as either operating or capital leases. On certain of our lease agreements, we may receive rent holidays and other\nincentives. We recognize lease costs on a straight-line basis without regard to deferred payment terms, such as rent holidays, that defer the commencement date of\nrequired payments. Additionally, incentives we receive are treated as a reduction of our costs over the term of the agreement. Leasehold improvements are\ncapitalized at cost and amortized over the lesser of their expected useful life or the non-cancellable term of the lease.\nWe establish assets and liabilities for the estimated construction costs incurred under build-to-suit lease arrangements to the extent we are involved in the\nconstruction of structural improvements or take construction risk prior to commencement of a lease. Upon occupancy of facilities under build-to-suit leases, we\nassess whether these arrangements qualify for sales recognition under the sale-leaseback accounting guidance. If we continue to be the deemed owner, the facilities\nare accounted for as finance leases.\nWe establish assets and liabilities for the present value of estimated future costs to retire long-lived assets at the termination or expiration of a lease.

In testing goodwill for impairment, we may elect to utilize a qualitative assessment to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of\na reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If our qualitative assessment indicates that goodwill impairment is more likely than not, we perform a two-step\nimpairment test. We test goodwill for impairment under the two-step impairment test by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the\nreporting units. If the fair value is determined to be less than the book value or qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired, a\nsecond step is performed to compute the amount of impairment as the difference between the estimated fair value of goodwill and the carrying value. We estimate\nthe fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating\nexpenses, based primarily on expected category expansion, pricing, market segment share, and general economic conditions.\nWe completed the required annual testing of goodwill for impairment for all reporting units as of April 1, 2017, and determined that goodwill is no t\nimpaired as the fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeded their book value.

When the license fee for a specific movie, television, or music title is determinable or reasonably estimable and the content is\navailable for streaming, we recognize an asset representing the fee and a corresponding liability for the amounts owed. We relieve the liability as payments are\nmade and we amortize the asset to “Cost of sales” on a straight-line basis or on an accelerated basis, based on estimated usage patterns, which typically ranges\nfrom one to five years.

Conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an\nasset, a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, or any other significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of\nan asset or group of assets may not be recoverable.\nFor long-lived assets used in operations, impairment losses are only recorded if the asset’s carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted,\nprobability-weighted future cash flows. We measure the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and estimated fair value. Long-lived\nassets are considered held for sale when certain criteria are met, including when management has committed to a plan to sell the asset, the asset is available for sale\nin its immediate condition, and the sale is probable within one year of the reporting date.

We reduce the liability for a gift card when\nredeemed by a customer. If a gift card is not redeemed, we recognize revenue when it expires or when the likelihood of its redemption becomes remote, generally\ntwo years from the date of issuance.\nUnearned Revenue\nUnearned revenue is recorded when payments are received in advance of performing our service obligations and is recognized over the service period.\nUnearned revenue primarily relates to prepayments of Amazon Prime memberships and AWS services.

The ASU defines\nnet realizable value as the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation.\nThe ASU is applicable to inventory that is accounted for under the first-in, first-out method. We adopted this ASU in Q1 2017 with no material impact to our\nconsolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued an ASU amending the accounting for stock-based compensation and requiring excess tax benefits and deficiencies to be\nrecognized as a component of income tax expense rather than equity. The inclusion of excess tax benefits and deficiencies as a component of our income tax\nexpense will increase volatility within our provision for income taxes as the amount of excess tax benefits or deficiencies from stock-based compensation awards\ndepends on our stock price at the date the awards vest. This guidance also requires excess tax benefits to be presented as an operating activity on the statement of\ncash flows and allows an entity to make an accounting policy election to either estimate expected forfeitures or to account for them as they occur. We adopted this\nASU in Q1 2017 by recording the cumulative impact through an increase in retained earnings of $687 million , and we will continue to estimate expected\nforfeitures. Additionally, we retrospectively adjusted our consolidated statements of cash flows to reclassify excess tax benefits of $119 million and $829 million\nfor the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2016 from financing activities to operating activities.\nAccounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn May 20",

We will adopt this ASU on\nJanuary 1, 2018 with a cumulative adjustment that will increase retained earnings by approximately $650 million rather than retrospectively adjusting prior\nperiods. The cumulative adjustment will primarily relate to unredeemed gift cards. We will begin to recognize revenue from estimated unredeemed gift cards over\nthe expected customer redemption period, which is substantially within nine months, rather than waiting until gift cards expire or when the likelihood of\nredemption becomes remote, generally two years from the date of issuance. Other changes relate to Amazon-branded electronic devices sold through retailers,\nwhich will be recognized upon sale to the retailer rather than to end customers. We also will change how we recognize and classify Amazon Prime memberships,\nwhich are currently considered arrangements with multiple deliverables that are allocated among products sales and service sales. Upon adoption of the ASU,\nAmazon Prime memberships will be accounted for as a single performance obligation recognized ratably over the membership period and will be classified as\nservice sales. Other changes that we have identified relate primarily to the presentation of revenue. Certain advertising services will be classified as revenue rather\nthan a reduction in cost of sales, and sales of apps, in-app content, and certain digital media content will primarily be presented on a net basis.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued an ASU which updates certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments.\nUnder this ASU, certain equity investments will be measured at fair value with changes recognized in net income. The ASU is effective for reporting periods\nbeginning after December 15, 2017. We do not expect adoption of the ASU in Q1 2018 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued an ASU amending the accounting for leases. The new guidance requires the recognition of lease assets and liabilities for\noperating leases with terms of more than 12 months, in addition to those currently recorded, on our consolidated balance sheets. Presentation of leases within the\nconsolidated statements of operations and\n49\n\n\nTable of Contents\nconsolidated statements of cash flows will be generally consistent with the current lease accounting guidance.

For intercompany transfers of inventory, the income\ntax effects will continue to be deferred until the inventory has been sold to a third party.

These\nexaminations may lead to ordinary course adjustments or proposed adjustments to our taxes or our net operating losses with respect to years under examination as\nwell as subsequent periods. As previously disclosed, we have received Notices of Proposed Adjustment (“NOPAs”) from the IRS for transactions undertaken in the\n2005 and 2006 calendar years relating to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries. The IRS is seeking to increase our U.S. taxable income by an amount that\nwould result in additional federal tax of approximately $1.5 billion , subject to interest. On March 23, 2017, the U.S. Tax Court issued its decision regarding the\nissues raised in the IRS NOPAs. The Tax Court rejected the approach from the IRS NOPAs in determining transfer pricing adjustments in 2005 and 2006 for the\ntransactions undertaken with our foreign subsidiaries and adopted, with adjustments, our suggested approach. On September 29, 2017, the IRS filed a notice of\nappeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. We will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. If the Tax Court decision were reversed\non appeal or if the IRS were to successfully assert transfer pricing adjustments of a similar nature to the NOPAs for transactions in subsequent years, we could be\nsubject to significant additional tax liabilities.\nCertain of our subsidiaries were under examination or investigation by the French Tax Administration (“FTA”) for calendar year 2006 and thereafter.

In December 2017, we settled this dispute with the FTA and included the impact thereof within our financial statements. In addition, in October 2014, the\nEuropean Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in Luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax\npaid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid. On October 4, 2017, the European Commission announced its decision that\ndeterminations by the tax authorities in Luxembourg did not comply with European Union rules on state aid. This decision orders Luxembourg to calculate and\nrecover additional taxes from us for the period May 2006 through June 2014. We believe this decision to be without merit and will consider our legal options,\nincluding an appeal. In December 2017, Luxembourg appealed the European Commission’s decision. While the European Commission announced an estimated\nrecovery amount of approximately  €250 million , plus interest, the actual amount of additional taxes subject to recovery is to be calculated by the Luxembourg tax\nauthorities in accordance with the European Commission’s guidance. Once the recovery amount is computed by Luxembourg, we anticipate funding it, including\ninterest, into escrow, where it will remain pending conclusion of all appeals. We may be required to fund into escrow an amount in excess of the estimated\nrecovery amount announced by the European Commission. We are also subject to taxation in various states and other foreign jurisdictions including Canada,\nChina, Germany, India, Japan,\n67\n\n\nTable of Contents\nLuxembourg, and the United Kingdom.  We are under, or may be subject to, audit or examination and additional assessments by the relevant authorities in respect\nof these particular jurisdictions primarily for 2008 and thereafter.\nWe expect the total amount of tax contingencies will grow in 2018 . In addition, changes in state, federal, and foreign tax laws may increase our tax\ncontingencies. The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain, and the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues\nraised by the taxing authorities may differ from the amounts accrued. It is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months we will receive additional\nassessments by various tax authorities or possibly reach resolution of income tax examinations in one or more jurisdictions. These assessments or settlements could\nresult in changes to our contingencies related to positions on tax filings in years through 2017 .

Our responsibility is to\nexpress an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and\nrequired to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and\nevaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary\nin the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting\nand the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of\nfinancial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of\nunauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with\nthe policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nSeattle, Washington\nFebruary 1, 2018\n74\n\n\nTable of Contents\nItem 9B.\nOther Information\nDisclosure Pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act\nWe determined that, between January 2012 and December 2017, we processed and delivered orders of consumer products for cer",

We seek to be Earth’s most customer-centric company. We are guided by four\nprinciples: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. In each of our\nsegments, we serve our primary customer sets, consisting of consumers, sellers, developers, enterprises, and content creators. In addition, we provide services, such\nas advertising services and co-branded credit card agreements.\nWe have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and Amazon Web Services (“AWS”). These segments reflect the way\nthe Company evaluates its business performance and manages its operations. Additional information on our operating segments and our net sales is contained in\nItem 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 11—Segment Information.” Our company-sponsored research and development expense is\nset forth within “Technology and content” in Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Consolidated Statements of Operations.” The\nfinancial results of Whole Foods Market, Inc.

We design our websites to enable\nhundreds of millions of unique products to be sold by us and by third parties across dozens of product categories. Customers access our offerings through our\nwebsites, mobile apps, Alexa, and physically visiting our stores. We also manufacture and sell electronic devices, including Kindle e-readers, Fire tablets, Fire\nTVs, and Echo devices, and we develop and produce media content. We strive to offer our customers the lowest prices possible through low everyday product\npricing and shipping offers, and to improve our operating efficiencies so that we can continue to lower prices for our customers. We also provide easy-to-use\nfunctionality, fast and reliable fulfillment, and timely customer service. In addition, we offer Amazon Prime, a membership program that includes unlimited free\nshipping on tens of millions of items, access to unlimited instant streaming of thousands of movies and TV episodes, and other benefits.\nWe fulfill customer orders in a number of ways, including through: North America and International fulfillment and delivery networks that we operate; co-\nsourced and outsourced arrangements in certain countries; digital delivery; and through our ",

The worldwide marketplace in which we compete is\nevolving rapidly and intensely competitive, and we face a broad array of competitors from many different industry sectors around the world. Our current and\npotential competitors include: (1) online, offline, and multichannel retailers, publishers, vendors, distributors, manufacturers, and producers of the products we\noffer and sell to consumers and businesses; (2) publishers, producers, and distributors of physical, digital, and interactive media of all types and all distribution\nchannels; (3) web search engines, comparison shopping websites, social networks, web portals, and other online and app-based means of discovering, using, or\nacquiring goods and services, either directly or in collaboration with other retailers; (4) companies that provide e-commerce services, including website\ndevelopment, advertising, fulfillment, customer service, and payment processing; (5) companies that provide fulfillment and logistics services for themselves or for\nthird parties, whether online or offline; (6) companies that provide information technology services or products, including on-premises or cloud-based\ninfrastructure and other services; and (7) companies that design, manufacture, market, or sell consumer electronics, telecommunication, and electronic devices.

If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows\ncould be materially adversely affected. In addition, the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks.\nWe Face Intense Competition\nOur businesses are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive, and we have many competitors in different industries, including retail, e-commerce services,\ndigital content and electronic devices, and web and infrastructure computing services. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longer\nhistories, more customers, and/or greater brand recognition, particularly with our newly-launched products and services and in our newer geographic regions. They\nmay secure better terms from vendors, adopt more aggressive pricing, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing.\nCompetition may intensify, including with the development of new business models and the entry of new and well-funded competitors, and as our\ncompetitors enter into business combinations or alliances and established companies in other market segments expand to become competitive with our business. In\naddition, new and enhanced technologies, including search, web and infrastructure computing services, digital content, and electronic devices, may increase our\ncompetition. The Internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping, and increased competition may reduce our sales and profits.\nOur Expansion Places a Significant Strain on our Management, Operational, Financial, and Other Resources\nWe are rapidly and significantly expanding our global operations, including increasing our product and service offerings and scaling our infrastructure to\nsupport our retail and services businesses. This expansion increases the complexity of our business and places significant strain on our management, personnel,\noperations, systems, technical performance, financial resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions.

In addition, we provide certain technology\nservices in China in conjunction with third parties that hold PRC licenses to provide services.

In addition, a number of countries are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, such as the recently\nenacted U.S. tax reform legislation commonly referred to as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “2017 Tax Act”). Finally, foreign governments may enact\ntax laws in response to the 2017 Tax Act that could result in further changes to global taxation and materially affect our financial position and results of operations.\nThe 2017 Tax Act significantly changes how the U.S. taxes corporations. The 2017 Tax Act requires complex computations to be performed that were not\npreviously required in U.S. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the 2017 Tax Act and significant estimates in\ncalculations, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. The U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other\nstandard-setting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the 2017 Tax Act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our\ninterpretation. As we complete our analysis of the 2017 Tax Act, collect and prepare necessary data, and interpret any additional guidance, we may make\nadjustments to provisional amounts that we have recorded that may materially impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are\nmade.\nWe are also currently subject to audit in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us. Developments in\nan audit, litigation, or the relevant laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations could have a material effect on our operating results or\ncash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. For instance, we have received Notices of\nProposed Adjustment (“NOPAs”) from the IRS for transactions undertaken in the 2005 and 2006 calendar years relating to transfer pricing with our foreign\nsubsidiaries and we have been contesting the matter in U.S. Tax Court. On March 23, 2017, the U.S. Tax Court issued its decision regarding the issues raised in the\nIRS NOPAs. The Tax Court rejected the approach from the IRS NOPAs in determining transfer pricing adjustments in 2005 and 2006 for the transactions\nundertaken with our foreign subsidiaries a",

On September 29, 2017, the IRS filed a notice of appeal to the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. We will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. If the Tax Court decision were reversed on appeal or if\nthe IRS were to successfully assert transfer pricing adjustments of a similar nature to the NOPAs for transactions in subsequent years, we could be subject to\nsignificant additional tax liabilities. In addition, in October 2014, the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax\nauthorities in Luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid. On October\n4, 2017, the European Commission announced its decision that determinations by the tax authorities in Luxembourg did not comply with European Union rules on\nstate aid. This decision orders Luxembourg to calculate and recover additional taxes from us for the period May 2006 through June 2014. We believe this decision\nto be without merit and will consider our legal options, including an appeal. In December 2017, Luxembourg appealed the European Commission’s decision.\nWhile the European Commission announced an estimated recovery amount of approximately €250 million, plus interest, the actual amount of additional taxes\nsubject to recovery is to be calculated by the Luxembourg tax authorities in accordance with the European Commission’s guidance. Although we believe our tax\nestimates are reasonable, the final outcome of tax audits, investigations, and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax\nprovisions and accruals.\nOur Supplier Relationships Subject Us to a Number of Risks\nWe have significant suppliers, including licensors, and in some cases, limited or single-sources of supply, that are important to our sourcing, services,\nmanufacturing, and any related ongoing servicing of merchandise and content. We do not have long-term arrangements with most of our suppliers to guarantee\navailability of merchandise, content, components, or services, particular payment terms, or the extension of credit limits. If our current suppliers were to stop\nselling or licensing merchandise, content, components, or services to us on acceptable terms, or delay delivery, including as a result of one or more supplier\nbankruptcies due to poor economic conditions, as a result of natural disasters, or for other reasons, we may be unable to procure alternatives from other suppliers in\na timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, if our suppliers or other vendors violate applicable laws, regulations, our code of\nstandards and responsibilities, or implement practices regarded as unethical, unsafe, or hazardous to the environment, it could damage our reputation, limit our\ngrowth, and negatively affect our operating results.\n13\n\n\nTable of ",

We may be subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts, and any\nviolations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contract, refunding or suspending of payments,\nforfeiture of profits, payment of fines, and suspension or debarment from future government business. In addition, such contracts may provide for termination by\nthe government at any time, without cause.\nWe May Be Subject to Product Liability Claims if People or Property Are Harmed by the Products We Sell or Manufacture\nSome of the products we sell or manufacture may expose us to product liability or food safety claims relating to personal injury or illness, death, or\nenvironmental or property damage, and may require product recalls or other actions. Certain third parties also sell products using our e-commerce services that\nmay increase our exposure to product liability claims, such as if these sellers do not have sufficient protection from such claims. Although we maintain liability\ninsurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on\neconomically reasonable terms, or at all. In addition, some of our agreements with our vendors and sellers do not indemnify us from product liability.\nWe Are Subject to Payments-Related Risks\nWe accept payments using a variety of methods, including credit card, debit card, credit accounts (including promotional financing), gift cards, direct debit\nfrom a customer’s bank account, consumer invoicing, physical bank check, and payment upon delivery. For existing and future payment options we offer to our\ncustomers, we may become subject to additional regulations and compliance requirements (including obligations to implement enhanced authentication processes\nthat could result in significant costs and reduce the ease of use of our payments products), as well as fraud. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit\ncards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability. We rely on third parties to provide\ncertain Amazon-branded payment methods and payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, electronic checks, and\npromotional financing.

The products offered through our consumer-facing\nwebsites and physical stores primarily include merchandise and content we have purchased for resale from vendors and products offered by third-party sellers, and\nwe also manufacture and sell electronic devices. Generally, we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory as product sales and recognize our\nnet share of revenue of items sold by third-party sellers as service sales.

We also offer other services such as compute, storage, and database offerings, fulfillment, publishing, certain digital content\nsubscriptions, advertising, and co-branded credit cards.\nOur financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flows 1 . Free cash flows are driven primarily by increasing operating income and\nefficiently managing working capital 2 and cash capital expenditures, including our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment. Increases in operating\nincome primarily result from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs, partially offset by investments we make in\nlonger-term strategic initiatives. To increase sales of products and services, we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience, including lowering\nprices, improving availability, offering faster delivery and performance times, increasing selection, increasing product categories and service offerings, expanding\nproduct information, improving ease of use, improving reliability, and earning customer trust.\nWe seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs.

On average, our high inventory velocity\nmeans we generally collect from consumers before our payments to suppliers come due.

Our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to\ngeographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations.

The SEC has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the\nportrayal of the company’s financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often\nas a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and\njudgments addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to\nunderstanding our results. For additional information, see Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1—Description of Business and\nAccounting Policies.” Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available.\nActual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions.\nInventories\nInventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost and\nnet realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as\nthrough sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. These assumptions\nabout future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material write-downs in the\nfuture. As a measure of sensitivity, for every 1% of additional inventory valuation allowance as of December 31, 2017 , we would have recorded an additional cost\nof sales of approximately $180 million.\nIn addition, we enter into supplier commitments for certain electronic device components and certain products offered in our Whole Foods Market stores.\nThese commitments are based on forecasted customer demand.

Our effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, such as intercompany transactions, the relative\namount of our foreign earnings, including earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in\njurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, the applicability of special tax regimes, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the\nrelated tax benefit, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, entry into new businesses and geographies, changes to our existing businesses and operations,\nacquisitions (including integrations) and investments and how they are financed, changes in our stock price, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and\ntheir valuation, and changes in the relevant tax, accounting, and other laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations. In addition, a\nnumber of countries are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, such as the recently enacted U.S. tax reform legislation\ncommonly referred to as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “2017 Tax Act”). Finally, foreign governments may enact tax laws in response to the 2017\nTax Act that could result in further changes to global taxation and materially affect our financial position and results of operations.\nThe 2017 Tax Act significantly changes how the U.S. taxes corporations. The 2017 Tax Act requires complex computations to be performed that were not\npreviously required in U.S. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the 2017 Tax Act and significant estimates in\ncalculations, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. The U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other\nstandard-setting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the 2017 Tax Act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our\ninterpretation. As we complete our analysis of the 2017 Tax Act, collect and prepare necessary data, and interpret any additional guidance, we may make\nadjustments to provisional amounts that we have recorded that may materially impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are\nmade.\nWe are also currently subject to audit in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us. Developments in\nan audit, litigation, or the relevant laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations could have a material effect on our operating results or\ncash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods.

On March 23, 2017, the U.S. Tax Court issued its decision\nregarding the issues raised in the IRS NOPAs. The Tax Court rejected the approach from the IRS NOPAs in determining transfer pricing adjustments in 2005 and\n2006 for the transactions undertaken with our foreign subsidiaries and adopted, with adjustments, our suggested approach. On September 29, 2017, the IRS filed a\nnotice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. We will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. If the Tax Court decision were\nreversed on appeal or if the IRS were to successfully assert transfer pricing adjustments of a similar nature to the NOPAs for transactions in subsequent years, we\ncould be subject to significant additional tax liabilities. In addition, in October 2014, the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether\ndecisions by the tax authorities in Luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on\nstate aid. On October 4, 2017, the European Commission announced its decision that determinations by the tax authorities in Luxembourg did not comply with\nEuropean Union rules on state aid. This decision orders Luxembourg to calculate and recover additional taxes from us for the period May 2006 through June 2014.\nWe believe this decision to be without merit and will consider our legal options, including an appeal. In December 2017, Luxembourg appealed the European\nCommission’s decision. While the European Commission announced an estimated recovery amount of approximately €250 million, plus interest, the actual amount\nof additional taxes subject to recovery is to be calculated by the Luxembourg tax authorities in accordance with the European Commission’s guidance.

We believe that offering\nlow prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success, and one way we offer lower prices is through shipping offers.\nCosts to operate our AWS segment are primarily classified as “Technology and content” as we leverage a shared infrastructure that supports both our internal\ntechnology requirements and external sales to AWS customers.\n27\n\n\nTable of Contents\nFulfillment\nFulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International fulfillment centers, customer service\ncenters, and physical stores and payment processing costs. While AWS payment processing and related transaction costs are included in fulfillment, AWS costs are\nprimarily classified as “Technology and content.” Fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors, such as payment processing and\nrelated transaction costs, our level of productivity and accuracy, changes in volume, size, and weight of units received and fulfilled, timing of fulfillment network\nand physical store expansion, the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties, mix of products and services sold, and our ability to affect\ncustomer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer self-service features. Additionally, because\npayment processing and fulfillment costs associated with seller transactions are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions, and payment\nprocessing and related transaction and fulfillment costs are higher as a percentage of sales versus our retail sales, sales by our sellers have higher fulfillment costs\nas a percent of net sales.\nThe increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars in 2016 and 2017 , compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to variable costs\ncorresponding with increased product and service sales volume and inventory levels, and costs from expanding our fulfillment network, which includes physical\nstores.\nWe seek to expand our fulfillment network to accommodate a greater selection and in-stock inventory levels and to meet anticipated shipment volumes from\nsales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services.

Net sales and related expenses generated from our\ninternationally-focused websites, and from www.amazon.ca and www.amazon.com.mx (which are included in our North America segment), are primarily\ndenominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding websites and primarily include Euros, Japanese Yen, and British Pounds. The results of operations\nof, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our internationally-focused websites and AWS are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations.\nUpon consolidation, as foreign exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant\ngains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. For example, as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates throughout the period compared\nto rates in effect the prior year, International segment net sales increased by $137 million in comparison with the prior year.\nWe have foreign exchange risk related to foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (“foreign funds”). Based on the balance of\nforeign funds as of December 31, 2017 , of $11.1 billion , an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in fair value declines of\n$555 million, $1.1 billion, and $2.2 billion. All investments are classified as “available-for-sale.” Fluctuations in fair value are recorded in “Accumulated other\ncomprehensive loss,” a separate component of stockholders’ equity.\nWe have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in various foreign currencies. Based on the intercompany balances as of\nDecember 31, 2017 , an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in losses of $280 million, $600 million, and $1.3 billion,\nrecorded to “Other income (expense), net.”\nSee Item 7 of Part I",

We record our\nequity and equity warrant investments in publicly traded companies at fair value, which is subject to market price volatility, and represents $415 million of our\ninvestments as of December 31, 2017 . We evaluate our equity and equity warrant investments in private companies for impairment when events and\ncircumstances indicate that the decline in fair value of such assets below the carrying value is other-than-temporary. Our analysis includes a review of recent\noperating results and trends, recent sales/acquisitions of the investee securities, and other publicly available data. The current global economic climate provides\nadditional uncertainty. Valuations of private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data.

We serve consumers through our retail websites\nand physical stores and focus on selection, price, and convenience. We also manufacture and sell electronic devices. We offer programs that enable sellers to sell\ntheir products on our websites and their own branded websites and to fulfill orders through us, and programs that allow authors, musicians, filmmakers, app\ndevelopers, and others to publish and sell content. We serve developers and enterprises of all sizes through our AWS segment, which offers a broad set of global\ncompute, storage, database, and other service offerings. In addition, we provide services, such as fulfillment, publishing, certain digital content subscriptions,\nadvertising, and co-branded credit cards.\nWe have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. See “Note 11—Segment Information.”\nPrior Period Reclassifications\nCertain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation, including the expanded presentation of “Net cash provided\nby (used in) investing activities” on our consolidated statements of cash flows and the allocation of stock-based compensation to “Other operating expense, net” in\nthe segment results within “Note 11 - Segment Information.” These revised segment results reflect the way our chief operating decision maker evaluates the\nCompany’s business performance and manages its operations. In addition, excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation were reclassified from “Net cash\nprovided by (used in) financing activities” to “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities” on our consolidated statements of cash flows as a result of the\nadoption of new accounting guidance.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Amazon.com, Inc., its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and those entities in which we have a\nvariable interest and of which we are the primary beneficiary, including certain entities in India and China and that support our seller lending financing activities\n(collectively, the “Company”).

Estimated selling prices are management’s best estimates of the prices that we would charge our customers if we were to sell the standalone elements\nseparately and include considerations of customer demand, prices charged by us and others for similar deliverables, and the price if largely based on the cost of\nproducing the product or service.\nSales of certain of our digital devices are considered arrangements with multiple deliverables, consisting of the device, undelivered software upgrades and/or\nundelivered non-software services such as cloud services.

We include interest and penalties related to our tax contingencies in income tax expense.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at\nthe measurement date. To increase the comparability of fair value measures, the following hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to\nmeasure fair value:\nLevel 1 —Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.\nLevel 2 —Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in\nactive markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be\ncorroborated by observable market data.\nLevel 3 —Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other\nmarket participants. These valuations require significant judgment.\n45\n\n\nTable of Contents\nFor our cash, cash equivalents, or marketable securities, we measure the fair value of money market funds and equity securities based on quoted prices in\nactive markets for identical assets or liabilities. All other financial instruments were valued either based on recent trades of securities in inactive markets or based\non quoted market prices of similar instruments and other significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. We did not hold any cash, cash\nequivalents, or marketable securities categorized as Level 3 assets as of December 31, 2016 and 2017 .\nAs part of entering into commercial agreements, we often obtain equity warrant assets giving us the right to acquire stock of other companies.

On certain of our lease agreements, we may receive rent holidays and other\nincentives. We recognize lease costs on a straight-line basis without regard to deferred payment terms, such as rent holidays, that defer the commencement date of\nrequired payments. Additionally, incentives we receive are treated as a reduction of our costs over the term of the agreement. Leasehold improvements are\ncapitalized at cost and amortized over the lesser of their expected useful life or the non-cancellable term of the lease.\nWe establish assets and liabilities for the estimated construction costs incurred under build-to-suit lease arrangements to the extent we are involved in the\nconstruction of structural improvements or take construction risk prior to commencement of a lease.

If our qualitative assessment indicates that goodwill impairment is more likely than not, we perform a two-step\nimpairment test. We test goodwill for impairment under the two-step impairment test by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the\nreporting units. If the fair value is determined to be less than the book value or qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired, a\nsecond step is performed to compute the amount of impairment as the difference between the estimated fair value of goodwill and the carrying value.

Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating\nexpenses, based primarily on expected category expansion, pricing, market segment share, and general economic conditions.\nWe completed the required annual testing of goodwill for impairment for all reporting units as of April 1, 2017, and determined that goodwill is no t\nimpaired as the fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeded their book value.

In connection with the settlement and remeasurement of intercompany balances, we recorded a loss of $215 million in 2015\nand recorded gains of $62 million and $202 million in 2016 and 2017 .\nAccounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted\nIn July 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued an Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) modifying the accounting for inventory.\nUnder this ASU, the measurement principle for inventory changed from lower of cost or market value to lower of cost and net realizable value. The ASU defines\nnet realizable value as the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation.\nThe ASU is applicable to inventory that is accounted for under the first-in, first-out method. We adopted this ASU in Q1 2017 with no material impact to our\nconsolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued an ASU amending the accounting for stock-based compensation and requiring excess tax benefits and deficiencies to be\nrecognized as a component of income tax expense rather than equity. The inclusion of excess tax benefits and deficiencies as a component of our income tax\nexpense will increase volatility within our provision for income taxes as the amount of excess tax benefits or deficiencies from stock-based compensation awards\ndepends on our stock price at the date the awards vest. This guidance also requires excess tax benefits to be presented as an operating activity on the statement of\ncash flows and allows an entity to make an accounting policy election to either estimate expected forfeitures or to account for them as they occur. We adopted this\nASU in Q1 2017 by recording the cumulative impact through an increase in retained earnings of $687 million , and we will continue to estimate expected\nforfeitures. Additionally, we retrospectively adjusted our consolidated statements of cash flows to reclassify excess tax benefits of $119 million and $829 million\nfor the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2016 from financing activities to operating activities.\nAccounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn May 20",

We will adopt this ASU on\nJanuary 1, 2018 with a cumulative adjustment that will increase retained earnings by approximately $650 million rather than retrospectively adjusting prior\nperiods. The cumulative adjustment will primarily relate to unredeemed gift cards. We will begin to recognize revenue from estimated unredeemed gift cards over\nthe expected customer redemption period, which is substantially within nine months, rather than waiting until gift cards expire or when the likelihood of\nredemption becomes remote, generally two years from the date of issuance. Other changes relate to Amazon-branded electronic devices sold through retailers,\nwhich will be recognized upon sale to the retailer rather than to end customers. We also will change how we recognize and classify Amazon Prime memberships,\nwhich are currently considered arrangements with multiple deliverables that are allocated among products sales and service sales. Upon adoption of the ASU,\nAmazon Prime memberships will be accounted for as a single performance obligation recognized ratably over the membership period and will be classified as\nservice sales. Other changes that we have identified relate primarily to the presentation of revenue. Certain advertising services will be classified as revenue rather\nthan a reduction in cost of sales, and sales of apps, in-app content, and certain digital media content will primarily be presented on a net basis.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued an ASU which updates certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments.\nUnder this ASU, certain equity investments will be measured at fair value with changes recognized in net income. The ASU is effective for reporting periods\nbeginning after December 15, 2017. We do not expect adoption of the ASU in Q1 2018 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued an ASU amending the accounting for leases. The new guidance requires the recognition of lease assets and liabilities for\noperating leases with terms of more than 12 months, in addition to those currently recorded, on our consolidated balance sheets. Presentation of leases within the\nconsolidated statements of operations and\n49\n\n\nTable of Contents\nconsolidated statements of cash flows will be generally consistent with the current lease accounting guidance. The ASU is effective for reporting periods beginning\nafter December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We plan to adopt this ASU beginning in Q1 2019.

The new guidance requires the recognition of the income tax\nconsequences of an intercompany asset transfer, other than transfers of inventory, when the transfer occurs. For intercompany transfers of inventory, the income\ntax effects will continue to be deferred until the inventory has been sold to a third party. The ASU is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15,\n2017, with early adoption permitted. We will adopt this ASU beginning in Q1 2018. We estimate the ASU will have an impact of approximately $250 million on\nour consolidated financial statements, including retained earnings and deferred taxes. This estimate takes into account valuation allowances that we anticipate\nrecording against certain material deferred tax assets. Any change in our assessment of the likelihood of our ability to realize deferred tax assets will be reflected as\nan income tax benefit during the quarter of such change.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued an ASU amending the presentation of restricted cash within the statement of cash flows. The new guidance requires that\nrestricted cash be included within cash and cash equivalents on the statement of cash flows. The ASU is effective retrospectively for reporting periods beginning\nafter December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted.

In December 2017, we settled this dispute with the FTA and included the impact thereof within our financial statements. In addition, in October 2014, the\nEuropean Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in Luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax\npaid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid. On October 4, 2017, the European Commission announced its decision that\ndeterminations by the tax authorities in Luxembourg did not comply with European Union rules on state aid. This decision orders Luxembourg to calculate and\nrecover additional taxes from us for the period May 2006 through June 2014. We believe this decision to be without merit and will consider our legal options,\nincluding an appeal. In December 2017, Luxembourg appealed the European Commission’s decision. While the European Commission announced an estimated\nrecovery amount of approximately  €250 million , plus interest, the actual amount of additional taxes subject to recovery is to be calculated by the Luxembourg tax\nauthorities in accordance with the European Commission’s guidance. Once the recovery amount is computed by Luxembourg, we anticipate funding it, including\ninterest, into escrow, where it will remain pending conclusion of all appeals.

It is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months we will receive additional\nassessments by various tax authorities or possibly reach resolution of income tax examinations in one or more jurisdictions. These assessments or settlements could\nresult in changes to our contingencies related to positions on tax filings in years through 2017 .

A company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of\nfinancial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of\nunauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with\nthe policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nSeattle, Washington\nFebruary 1, 2018\n74\n\n\nTable of Contents\nItem 9B.\nOther Information\nDisclosure Pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act\nWe determined that, between January 2012 and December 2017, we processed and delivered orders of consumer products for cer",
