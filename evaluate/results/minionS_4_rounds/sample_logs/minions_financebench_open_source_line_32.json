  "correctness_reasoning": "The predicted answer states a quick ratio of approximately 1.29, which is outside the 10% tolerance range of the ground truth quick ratio of 1.57 (acceptable range: 1.413 to 1.727). Additionally, the stance on the liquidity profile being 'reasonably healthy' is not supported by the correct quick ratio value."
