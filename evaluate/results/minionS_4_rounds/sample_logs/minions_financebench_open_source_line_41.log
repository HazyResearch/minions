--- Question ---
Does AMEX have an improving operating margin profile as of 2022? If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
Operating margin is a relevant metric for AMEX as it provides insight into the company's profitability and efficiency in managing its business operations. However, the collected outputs lack direct operating margin data for AMEX for 2022, and attempts to infer margins are based on assumptions and partial data. The relevance of operating margin is supported by its impact on AMEX's ability to manage costs, maintain profitability, and make strategic decisions.

--- Ground Truth ---
['Performance is not measured through operating margin']

--- Correctness Evaluation ---
Is correct: False
Confidence: 0.80
Reasoning: The ground truth states that performance is not measured through operating margin for AMEX, implying that operating margin is not a useful metric for evaluating AMEX's performance. The predicted answer incorrectly asserts that operating margin is relevant for AMEX, which contradicts the ground truth. Therefore, the predicted answer does not align with the key facts and conclusions of the ground truth.
