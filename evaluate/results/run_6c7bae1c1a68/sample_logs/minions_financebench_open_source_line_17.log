--- Question ---
Roughly how many times has AES Corporation sold its inventory in FY2022? Calculate inventory turnover ratio for the FY2022; if conventional inventory management is not meaningful for the company then state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
Conventional inventory management is not applicable to AES Corporation because the company is primarily involved in the generation and distribution of electricity, which does not involve managing physical inventory. Therefore, calculating an inventory turnover ratio is not meaningful for AES Corporation.

--- Ground Truth ---
['AES has converted inventory 9.5 times in FY 2022.']
