--- Question ---
Is 3M a capital-intensive business based on FY2022 data?

--- Predicted Answer ---
Yes, 3M is a capital-intensive business based on FY2022 data.

--- Ground Truth ---
['No, the company is managing its CAPEX and Fixed Assets pretty efficiently, which is evident from below key metrics:\nCAPEX/Revenue Ratio: 5.1%\nFixed assets/Total Assets: 20%\nReturn on Assets= 12.4%']

--- Correctness Evaluation ---
Is correct: False
Confidence: 1.00
Reasoning: The predicted answer states that 3M is a capital-intensive business, which directly contradicts the ground truth answer. The evaluation rules for yes/no questions require the stance to match exactly, and in this case, they do not.
