Total length: 433486 characters to answer this question. \n\nAlso consider the following constraints:\n- In your response do NOT use numbered lists.\n- Do NOT structure your response as a sequence of steps.\n",
      "output": "To answer the question about Corning's 3-year average unadjusted operating income percentage margin for FY2019 to FY2021, focus on extracting specific data from the income statement section of the financial document. Identify the operating income figures for each of the fiscal years 2019, 2020, and 2021. Additionally, obtain the total revenue figures for these same years, as the operating income percentage margin is calculated by dividing the operating income by the total revenue and then multiplying by 100 to convert it into a percentage. Once you have these figures, calculate the operating income percentage for each year, sum them up, and then divide by three to find the average. Ensure that all calculations are rounded to one decimal place as required."

Instead, you can assign small, isolated tasks to a less capable worker model that sees only a single chunk of text at a time. Any cross-chunk or multi-document reasoning must be handled by you.\n\n## Your Job: Write Two Python Functions\n\n### FUNCTION #1: `prepare_jobs(context, prev_job_manifests, prev_job_outputs) -> List[JobManifest]`\n- Break the document(s) into chunks (using the provided chunking function, if needed). Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 12 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`. All **multi-chunk integration** or **global reasoning** is your responsibility here.\n- Return one **aggregated string** suitable for further supervisor inspection.\n\n\n\n## Relevant Pydantic Models\n\nThe following models are already in the global scope. **Do NOT redefine or re-import them.**\n\n### JobManifest Model\n```\nclass JobManifest(BaseModel):\n    chunk: str  # the actual text for the chunk of the document\n    task: str  # the actual task instruction for the small model\n    advice: str  # optional, any additional advice on how to perform the task\n\n    chunk_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    task_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    job_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n\n```\n\n### JobOutput Model\n```\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    citation: Optional[str]\n    answer: Optional[str]\n\n```\n\n## Function Signatures\n```\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        context (List[str]): A list of documents.

This data is crucial for calculating the operating income percentage margin for each year.\n\n2. **Sufficiency of Information**: The information gathered is sufficient to answer the question. We have the necessary financial figures (operating income and total revenue) for each of the three years, which allows us to compute the operating income percentage margin.\n\n3. **Calculation**: To calculate the operating income percentage margin for each year, we use the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Operating Income Percentage Margin} = \\left(\\frac{\\text{Operating Income}}{\\text{Total Revenue}}\\right) \\times 100\n   \\]\n   We will perform this calculation for each year (2019, 2020, 2021), sum the results, and then divide by three to find the average margin over the three years. Finally, we will round the result to one decimal place as required.\n\n4. **Conflicting Answers**: If there were conflicting answers, we would use the citations provided in the job outputs to verify the accuracy of the figures. However, assuming the data is consistent, we can proceed with the calculations.\n\nIn summary, we have the necessary data to compute the 3-year average unadjusted operating income percentage margin for Corning, and we can proceed with the calculations as outlined."
