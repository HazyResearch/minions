--- Question ---
What drove operating margin change as of FY2022 for 3M? If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then please state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
3M's operating margin for FY2022 was primarily affected by litigation costs, including a $1.2 billion pre-tax charge related to Combat Arms Earplugs litigation and PFAS-related matters. External factors such as geopolitical tensions, supply chain disruptions, raw material price inflation, and foreign exchange impacts also contributed to changes in the operating margin. The document does not explicitly state that operating margin is not a useful metric for 3M, but the complexity of influencing factors suggests it may not fully capture the company's financial health.
