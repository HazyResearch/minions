--- Question ---
Has AMCOR's quick ratio improved or declined between FY2023 and FY2022? If the quick ratio is not something that a financial analyst would ask about a company like this, then state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
AMCOR's quick ratio has declined from FY2022 to FY2023.

--- Ground Truth ---
['The quick ratio has slightly improved from 0.67 times to 0.69 times between FY 2023 and FY 2022.(3.4% jump)']

--- Correctness Evaluation ---
Is correct: False
Confidence: 1.00
Reasoning: The predicted answer states that AMCOR's quick ratio has declined from FY2022 to FY2023, which contradicts the ground truth answer indicating an improvement from 0.67 to 0.69. This is a clear discrepancy in the stance regarding the change in the quick ratio.
