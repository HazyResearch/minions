--- Question ---
Has AMCOR's quick ratio improved or declined between FY2023 and FY2022? If the quick ratio is not something that a financial analyst would ask about a company like this, then state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
AMCOR's quick ratio declined from approximately 0.928 in FY2022 to 0.915 in FY2023.

--- Ground Truth ---
['The quick ratio has slightly improved from 0.67 times to 0.69 times between FY 2023 and FY 2022.(3.4% jump)']

--- Correctness Evaluation ---
Is correct: False
Confidence: 0.90
Reasoning: The predicted answer states that AMCOR's quick ratio declined from 0.928 in FY2022 to 0.915 in FY2023, which contradicts the ground truth answer that indicates an improvement from 0.67 to 0.69. The numerical values in the predicted answer are outside the 10% tolerance range of the ground truth values, leading to a conclusion that the predicted answer is incorrect.
