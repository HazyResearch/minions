Total length: 346534 characters to answer this question. \n\nAlso consider the following constraints:\n- In your response do NOT use numbered lists.\n- Do NOT structure your response as a sequence of steps.\n",
      "output": "To answer the question about Best Buy's 3-year average net profit margin from FY2015 to FY2017, focus on extracting specific financial data from the income statement. Identify the net profit (or net income) and total revenue for each fiscal year within the specified period. The net profit margin is calculated by dividing the net profit by the total revenue and then multiplying by 100 to convert it to a percentage. Once you have the net profit margins for each year, calculate the average of these percentages to determine the 3-year average net profit margin. Ensure that all calculations are rounded to one decimal place as required."

Instead, you can assign small, isolated tasks to a less capable worker model that sees only a single chunk of text at a time. Any cross-chunk or multi-document reasoning must be handled by you.\n\n## Your Job: Write Two Python Functions\n\n### FUNCTION #1: `prepare_jobs(context, prev_job_manifests, prev_job_outputs) -> List[JobManifest]`\n- Break the document(s) into chunks (using the provided chunking function, if needed). Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 12 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`. All **multi-chunk integration** or **global reasoning** is your responsibility here.\n- Return one **aggregated string** suitable for further supervisor inspection.\n\n\n\n## Relevant Pydantic Models\n\nThe following models are already in the global scope. **Do NOT redefine or re-import them.**\n\n### JobManifest Model\n```\nclass JobManifest(BaseModel):\n    chunk: str  # the actual text for the chunk of the document\n    task: str  # the actual task instruction for the small model\n    advice: str  # optional, any additional advice on how to perform the task\n\n    chunk_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    task_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    job_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n\n```\n\n### JobOutput Model\n```\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    citation: Optional[str]\n    answer: Optional[str]\n\n```\n\n## Function Signatures\n```\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        context (List[str]): A list of documents.

The new\nguidance changes certain aspects of accounting for share-based payments including accounting for income taxes, forfeitures and classifications in the statement of\ncash flows. We plan to adopt this standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, which aligns with the required adoption date. As allowed by ASU 2016-09, we plan to\nchange our accounting for forfeitures from our current method of estimating the number of awards that are expected to vest to recording forfeitures as they occur.\nThis will require a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of fiscal 2018. We do not expect this adjustment to be material to our financial\nstatements. In addition, we do not expect the remaining changes caused by ASU 2016-09 to have a material impact to our financial statements.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments , and in November 2016,\nthe FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows: Restricted Cash . ASU 2016-15 provides classification requirements for specific transactions within the\nstatement of cash flows, while ASU 2016-18 requires restricted cash balances be included in the beginning and ending cash balance within the statement of cash\nflows. We plan to retrospectively adopt these standards in the first quarter of our fi",

The figures used are consistent across multiple outputs.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe gathered information is sufficient to calculate the 3-year average net profit margin for Best Buy from FY2015 to FY2017. The average net profit margin is 2.8%, rounded to one decimal place."
