--- Question ---
Roughly how many times has JnJ sold its inventory in FY2022? Calculate inventory turnover ratio for FY2022; if conventional inventory management is not meaningful for the company then state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
The inventory turnover ratio for J&J in FY2022 is approximately 1, but conventional inventory management may not be meaningful.

--- Ground Truth ---
['JnJ sold its inventory 2.7 times in FY2022.']

--- Correctness Evaluation ---
Is correct: False
Confidence: 0.80
Reasoning: The predicted answer states an inventory turnover ratio of approximately 1, which is outside the 10% tolerance range of the ground truth answer of 2.7 (acceptable range: 2.43 to 2.97). Additionally, the predicted answer suggests that conventional inventory management may not be meaningful, but does not provide a clear explanation for this claim, which is required if deviating from the numerical answer.
