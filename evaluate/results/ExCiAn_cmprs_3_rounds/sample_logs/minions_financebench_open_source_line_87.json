  "correctness_reasoning": "The predicted answer incorrectly states that JnJ's gross margin improved from a negative 5.0% to 6.7%, which is not mentioned in the ground truth. The ground truth focuses on specific factors affecting gross margin, such as COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing exit costs, currency impacts, and commodity inflation, which are not fully captured in the predicted answer. Additionally, the predicted answer mentions strategic cost reductions, which are not part of the ground truth."
