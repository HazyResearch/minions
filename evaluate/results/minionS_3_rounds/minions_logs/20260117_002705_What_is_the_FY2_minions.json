Total length: 600488 characters to answer this question. \n\nAlso consider the following constraints:\n- In your response do NOT use numbered lists.\n- Do NOT structure your response as a sequence of steps.\n",
      "output": "To answer the question about the 3-year average of capex as a percentage of revenue for MGM Resorts from FY2018 to FY2020, focus on extracting specific financial data from the document. You will need to locate the capital expenditures (capex) figures from the statement of cash flows for each fiscal year. Additionally, find the total revenue figures from the statement of income for the same years. Once you have these figures, calculate the capex as a percentage of revenue for each year by dividing the capex by the revenue and multiplying by 100 to convert it to a percentage. Finally, compute the average of these percentages over the three years to get the desired result. Ensure that all calculations are rounded to one decimal place as required."

      "prompt": "# Decomposition Round #1\n\nYou (the supervisor) cannot directly read the document(s). Instead, you can assign small, isolated tasks to a less capable worker model that sees only a single chunk of text at a time. Any cross-chunk or multi-document reasoning must be handled by you.\n\n## Your Job: Write Two Python Functions\n\n### FUNCTION #1: `prepare_jobs(context, prev_job_manifests, prev_job_outputs) -> List[JobManifest]`\n- Break the document(s) into chunks (using the provided chunking function, if needed). Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 12 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`. All **multi-chunk integration** or **global reasoning** is your responsibility here.\n- Return one **aggregated string** suitable for further supervisor inspection.\n\n\n\n## Relevant Pydantic Models\n\nThe following models are already in the global scope. **Do NOT redefine or re-import them.**\n\n### JobManifest Model\n```\nclass JobManifest(BaseModel):\n    chunk: str  # the actual text for the chunk of the document\n    task: str  # the actual task instruction for the small model\n    advice: str  # optional, any additional advice on how to perform the task\n\n    chunk_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    task_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    job_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n\n```\n\n### JobOutput Model\n```\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    citation: Optional[str]\n    answer: Optional[str]\n\n```\n\n## Function Signatures\n```\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        context (List[str]): A list of documents.

The data is incomplete and inconsistent, with multiple conflicting figures for both capex and revenue.\n\n3. **Missing Information:**\n   - We need clear and consistent capex figures for FY2018, FY2019, and FY2020.\n   - We need clear and consistent revenue figures for the same fiscal years.\n   - The data should be verified for accuracy and consistency to ensure reliable calculations.\n\n4. **Calculation/Derivation:**\n   - If we had consistent and verified data, the calculation would involve:\n     - Calculating the capex as a percentage of revenue for each year: \\((\\text{Capex} / \\text{Revenue}) \\times 100\\%\\).\n     - Averaging these percentages over the three years to get the final result.\n\n5. **Conflicting Answers:**\n   - There are multiple conflicting figures for both capex and revenue. Without clear citations or a method to verify which figures are correct, it is impossible to resolve these conflicts.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTo proceed, we need to gather more reliable and consistent data for both capex and revenue for FY2018, FY2019, and FY2020. This may involve revisiting the document to extract clearer data or seeking additional sources to verify the figures. Once we have accurate data, we can perform the necessary calculations to answer the question."

Each chunk is ensured to be a string before being used to create a `JobManifest`.\n\n- **Job Manifest Creation**: Each `JobManifest` is created with a single string chunk, ensuring compatibility with the expected input type.\n\nThis should resolve the validation error by ensuring that each chunk is a string when creating the `JobManifest`."

What information we have gathered\n2. Whether it is sufficient to answer the question\n3. If not sufficient, what specific information is missing\n4. If sufficient, how we would calculate or derive the answer\n5. If there are conflicting answers:\n--> Use citations to select the correct answer if there are conflicting answers.\n\nBe brief and concise. No need for structured output - just think through the steps. You MUST respond in markdown format (for $ signs make sure to use escape character \\ before the $ sign).\n",
      "output": "### Analysis\n\n1. **Information Gathered**:\n   - **Capex Figures**: We have some capex figures extracted from the document, specifically:\n     - $270,579 (2020), $739,006 (2019), and $1,486,843 (2018) from chunk #101.\n     - These figures are consistent with those found in chunk #153.\n   - **Revenue Figures**: We have revenue figures extracted from the document:\n     - $5,162,082 (2020), $12,899,672 (2019), $11,763,096 (2018) from chunk #271.\n     - These figures are consistent with those found in chunk #274.\n\n2. **Sufficiency**:\n   - The information gathered is sufficient to calculate the average capex as a percentage of revenue for FY2018 to FY2020. We have both capex and revenue figures for each of the three years.\n\n3. **Calculation**:\n   - For each year, calculate capex as a percentage of revenue:\n     - 2018: \\((1,486,843 / 11,763,096) \\times 100\\)\n     - 2019: \\((739,006 / 12,899,672) \\times 100\\)\n     - 2020: \\((270,579 / 5,162,082) \\times 100\\)\n   - Compute the average of these percentages over the three years.\n\n4. **Conflicting Answers**:\n   - There are no conflicting answers for the capex and revenue figures as the extracted data is consistent across multiple chunks.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWe have the necessary data to calculate the 3-year average of capex as a percentage of revenue for MGM Resorts from FY2018 to FY2020. The calculations can be performed using the extracted figures, and the results can be rounded to one decimal place as required."
