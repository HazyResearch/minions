--- Question ---
Has AMCOR's quick ratio improved or declined between FY2023 and FY2022? If the quick ratio is not something that a financial analyst would ask about a company like this, then state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
AMCOR's quick ratio has declined from FY2022 to FY2023.

--- Ground Truth ---
['The quick ratio has slightly improved from 0.67 times to 0.69 times between FY 2023 and FY 2022.(3.4% jump)']

--- Correctness Evaluation ---
Is correct: False
Confidence: 1.00
Reasoning: The predicted answer states that AMCOR's quick ratio has declined from FY2022 to FY2023, which contradicts the ground truth answer that indicates an improvement from 0.67 to 0.69. The stance does not match, and thus the predicted answer is incorrect.
