      "output": "To determine the FY2017 operating cash flow ratio for Adobe, focus on extracting specific data from the financial document. You need to locate the cash flow statement to find the \"cash from operations\" figure for FY2017. Additionally, examine the balance sheet to identify the \"total current liabilities\" for the same fiscal year. These two figures are essential for calculating the operating cash flow ratio. Ensure that the data corresponds to the fiscal year 2017 to maintain accuracy. Once you have these figures, divide the cash from operations by the total current liabilities and round the result to two decimal places to obtain the operating cash flow ratio."

Instead, you can assign small, isolated tasks to a less capable worker model that sees only a single chunk of text at a time. Any cross-chunk or multi-document reasoning must be handled by you.\n\n## Your Job: Write Two Python Functions\n\n### FUNCTION #1: `prepare_jobs(context, prev_job_manifests, prev_job_outputs) -> List[JobManifest]`\n- Break the document(s) into chunks (using the provided chunking function, if needed). Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 12 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`. All **multi-chunk integration** or **global reasoning** is your responsibility here.\n- Return one **aggregated string** suitable for further supervisor inspection.\n\n\n\n## Relevant Pydantic Models\n\nThe following models are already in the global scope. **Do NOT redefine or re-import them.**\n\n### JobManifest Model\n```\nclass JobManifest(BaseModel):\n    chunk: str  # the actual text for the chunk of the document\n    task: str  # the actual task instruction for the small model\n    advice: str  # optional, any additional advice on how to perform the task\n\n    chunk_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    task_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    job_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n\n```\n\n### JobOutput Model\n```\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    citation: Optional[str]\n    answer: Optional[str]\n\n```\n\n## Function Signatures\n```\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        context (List[str]): A list of documents.

Estimates are used for, but not limited to, sales allowances and programs, bad debts, stock-\nbased compensation, determining the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities, excess inventory and purchase \ncommitments, facilities lease losses, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, litigation, income taxes and investments. Actual \nresults may differ materially from these estimates.\nFiscal Year\nOur fiscal year is a 52- or 53-week year that ends on the Friday closest to November 30. Our financial results for fiscal \n2016 benefited from an extra week in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 due to our 52/53 week financial calendar whereby fiscal 2016\nwas a 53-week fiscal year compared with fiscal 2017 and 2015 which were 52-week fiscal years.\nReclassifications\nCertain immaterial prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation in the Consolidated \nBalance Sheets, Consolidated Statements of Income and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. \nSignificant Accounting Policies\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenue is derived from the subscription, non-software related hosted services, term-based and perpetual licensing of \nsoftware products, associated software maintenance and support plans, consulting services, training, and technical support. Most \nof our enterprise customer arrangements are complex, involving multiple solutions and various license rights, bundled with post-\ncontract customer support and other meaningful rights that together provide a complete end-to-end solution to the customer. \nWe recognize revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement \nexists, we have delivered the product or performed the service, the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is probable. \n\n\nTable of Contents\nADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED\n NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n63\nDetermining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have \na significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report. \nMultiple Element Arrangements\nWe enter into multiple element revenue arrangements in which a customer may purchase a combination of software, upgrades, \nmaintenance and support, hosted services, and consulting.\n",

If there are no treasury stock gains in additional paid-in-capital, the losses \nupon re-issuance of treasury stock are recorded as a reduction of retained earnings in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nAdvertising Expenses\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 were $141.7 million, \n$135.8 million and $113.6 million, respectively.\nForeign Currency Translation\nWe translate assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, whose functional currency is their local currency, at exchange \nrates in effect at the balance sheet date. We translate revenue and expenses at the monthly average exchange rates. We include \naccumulated net translation adjustments in stockholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income \n(loss).\nForeign Currency and Other Hedging Instruments\nIn countries outside the United States, we transact business in U.S. Dollars and in various other currencies. We use foreign \nexchange option and forward contracts for revenue denominated in Euros, British Pounds and Japanese Yen. We hedge our net \nrecognized foreign currency assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and \ncash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. \nWe recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and measure them \nat fair value.

Further, the \namendments allow the entities to make an accounting policy election to either estimate forfeitures or recognize forfeitures as they \noccur. If an election is made, the change to recognize forfeitures as they occur must be adopted using a modified retrospective \napproach with a cumulative effect adjustment recorded to opening retained earnings.

As required by the standard, excess tax benefits \nrecognized on stock-based compensation expense were reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Income as a component of the \nprovision for income taxes rather than paid-in capital on a prospective basis. Accordingly, we recorded excess tax benefits within \nour provision for income taxes, rather than additional paid-in capital upon adoption. The cumulative effect to retained earnings \nfrom previously unrecognized excess tax benefits, after offset by the related valuation allowance, was not significant to our \nConsolidated Balance Sheets. \nWe also elected to prospectively apply the change in presentation of excess tax benefits wherein excess tax benefits \nrecognized on stock-based compensation expense were classified as operating activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash \nFlows for fiscal 2017.

In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU \nNo. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Deferral of the Effective Date, which deferred the effective date of the \nnew revenue standard for periods beginning after December 15, 2016 to December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted but \nnot earlier than the original effective date. Accordingly, the updated standard is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. \nWe expect to adopt this updated standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 on a modified retrospective basis. We are currently \nevaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures.\nWhile we are continuing to assess all potential impacts of the new standard, we currently believe that the most significant \nimpact relates to our accounting for arrangements that include on-premise term-based software licenses bundled with maintenance \nand support. Under current GAAP, the revenue attributable to these software licenses is recognized ratably over the term of the \narrangement because VSOE does not exist for the undelivered maintenance and support element as it is not sold separately. The \nrequirement to have VSOE for undelivered elements to enable the separation of revenue for the delivered software licenses is \neliminated under the new standard. Accordingly, under the new standard we will be required to recognize as revenue a portion of \nthe arrangement fee upon delivery of the software licenses. We expect revenue related to our professional services and cloud \nofferings, including Creative Cloud and Document Cloud for business enterprises, individuals and teams, to remain substantially \nunchanged. When sold with cloud-enabled services, Creative Cloud and Document Cloud require a significant level of integration \nand interdependency with software and the individual components are not considered distinct. Revenue for these offerings will \ncontinue to be recognized over the period in which the cloud services are provided.  Under current GAAP, we expense costs related \nto the acquisition of revenue-generating contracts as incurred. Under the new standard, we will be required to capitalize certain \ncosts incremental to contract acquisition and amortize them over the expected period of benefit. Due to the complexity of certain \nof our contracts, the actual accounting treatment required under the new standard for these arrangements may be dependent on \ncontract-specific terms and therefore may vary in some instances.\nOn February 24, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, requiring lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and \na lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with the exception of short-term le",

These contracts \ndo not subject us to material balance sheet risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these derivatives are \nintended to offset gains and losses on the assets and liabilities being hedged. \nAs of December 1, 2017, total notional amounts of outstanding contracts were $333.9 million which included the notional \nequivalent of $105.0 million in Euros, $34.6 million in British Pounds, $45.4 million in Japanese Yen, $78.0 million in Indian \nRupees, and $70.9 million in other foreign currencies.

We record changes in \nthe intrinsic value of these cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in our Consolidated Balance \nSheets, until the forecasted transaction occurs. When the forecasted transaction occurs, we reclassify the related gain or loss on \nthe cash flow hedge to revenue. In the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur, or it becomes probable that it \nwill not occur, we reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) \nto interest and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income at that time. If we do not elect hedge \naccounting, or the contract does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the changes in fair value from period to period are \nrecorded in interest and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. \nFor fiscal 2017 and 2016, there were no net gains or losses recognized in other income relating to hedges of forecasted \ntransactions that did not occur. In fiscal 2015, these net gains or losses were immaterial.\nFair Value Hedging—Hedges of Interest Rate Risks\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal 2014, we entered into interest rate swaps designated as a fair value hedge related to our \n$900 million of 4.75% fixed interest rate senior notes due February 1, 2020 (the “2020 Notes”). In effect, the interest rate swaps \nconvert the fixed interest rate on our 2020 Notes to a floating interest rate based on the LIBOR. Under the terms of the swaps, we \nwill pay monthly interest at the one-month LIBOR rate plus a fixed number of basis points on the $900 million notional amount \nthrough February 1, 2020. In exchange, we will receive 4.75% fixed rate interest from the swap counterparties. See Note 15 for \nfurther details regarding our debt.\nThe interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges and substantially offset the changes in fair value of the hedged \nportion of the underlying debt that are attributable to the changes in market risk. Therefore, the gains and losses related to changes \nin the fair value of the interest rate swaps are included in interest and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements \nof Income.

Our \nextended sales cycle for these products and services makes it difficult to predict when a given sales cycle will close.\nSubscription offerings could create risks related to the timing of revenue recognition.  \nWe generally recognize revenue from subscription offerings ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements, \nwhich range from 1 to 36 months.

Declines in new or renewed subscriptions may decrease our revenue \nin future quarters.  Lower sales, reduced demand for our products and services, and increases in our attrition rate may not be \nfully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. Our subscription model could also make it difficult for us to \nrapidly increase our revenue from subscription-based or hosted services through additional sales in any period, as revenue from \nnew customers will be recognized over the applicable subscription term. \nAdditionally, in connection with our sales efforts to enterprise customers and our use of ETLAs, a number of factors \ncould affect our revenue, including longer-than-expected sales and implementation cycles, potential deferral of revenue due to \nmultiple-element revenue arrangements and alternative licensing arrangements.

As we target our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers, these trends are expected to continue and could \nhave a greater impact on our results of operations.  Additionally, our enterprise sales pattern has historically been uneven, where \na higher percentage of a quarter’s total sales occur during the final weeks of each quarter, which is common in our industry.  Our \nextended sales cycle for these products and services makes it difficult to predict when a given sales cycle will close.\nSubscription offerings could create risks related to the timing of revenue recognition.  \nWe generally recognize revenue from subscription offerings ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements, \nwhich range from 1 to 36 months. As a result, most of the subscription revenue we report in each quarter is the result of \nsubscription agreements entered into during previous quarters. Any reduction in new or renewed subscriptions in a quarter may \nnot be reflected in our revenue results until a later quarter.  Declines in new or renewed subscriptions may decrease our revenue \nin future quarters.  Lower sales, reduced demand for our products and services, and increases in our attrition rate may not be \nfully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. Our subscription model could also make it difficult for us to \nrapidly increase our revenue from subscription-based or hosted services through additional sales in any period, as revenue from \nnew customers will be recognized over the applicable subscription term. \nAdditionally, in connection with our sales efforts to enterprise customers and our use of ETLAs, a number of factors \ncould affect our revenue, including longer-than-expected sales and implementation cycles, potential deferral of revenue due to \nmultiple-element revenue arrangements and alternative licensing arrangements. If any of our assumptions about revenue from \nour subscription-based offerings prove incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from those anticipated.\nIf our customers fail to renew subscriptions in accordance with our expectations, our future revenue and operating results \ncould suffer.\nOur Adobe Experience Cloud, Creative Cloud, and Document Cloud offerings typically involve subscription based \nofferings pursuant to product and service agreements. Revenue from our subscription customers is generally recognized ratably \nover the term of their agreements, which typically range from 1 to 36 months.  Our customers have no obligation to renew their \nsubscriptions for our services after the expiration of their initial subscription period, and customers may not renew their \nsubscriptions at the same or higher level of service, for the same number of seats or for the same duration of time, if at all. \nMoreover, under certain circumstances, some of our customers have the right to cancel their agreem",

Other sources of cash are proceeds from participation \nin the employee stock purchase plan. Other uses of cash include our stock repurchase program, which is described below, business \nacquisitions and purchases of property and equipment. \nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nFor fiscal 2017, net cash provided by operating activities of $2.91 billion was primarily comprised of net income plus the \nnet effect of non-cash items. The primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with increases in deferred \nrevenue and accrued expenses. The increase in deferred revenue was primarily due to increased subscriptions for our Creative \nCloud offerings and increases in Digital Marketing hosted services. The increase in accrued expenses is primarily due to the \nincrease in accruals for compensation costs and employee benefits driven by headcount growth, and increased accrued media costs \nassociated with our Advertising Cloud offerings, including TubeMogul. The primary working capital uses of cash were increases \nin trade receivables, payments of trade payables assumed as part of the TubeMogul acquisition, and a decrease in income taxes \npayable. Trade receivables increased primarily due to revenue linearity, higher revenue levels, and increased media rebill receivables \nattributable to TubeMogul. Income taxes payable decreased primarily due to taxes paid in excess of the tax provision increase.\nFor fiscal 2016, net cash provided by operating activities of $2.20 billion was primarily comprised of net income plus the \nnet effect of non-cash items.

During fiscal 2017 and 2015, we determined there were no \nother-than-temporary impairments on our cost and equity method investments. During fiscal 2016, we determined there were \nimmaterial other-than-temporary impairments on certain of our cost method investments and wrote down the investments to fair \nvalue. \nThe fair value of our senior notes was $1.98 billion as of December 1, 2017, based on observable market prices in less \nactive markets and categorized as Level 2. See Note 15 for further details regarding our debt.\nNOTE 5.  DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES\nHedge Accounting and Hedging Programs\nWe recognize derivative instruments and hedging activities as either assets or liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets \nand measure them at fair value. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are accounted for depending on the use of \nthe derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting.\nWe evaluate hedge effectiveness at the inception of the hedge prospectively as well as retrospectively, and record any \nineffective portion of the hedging instruments in interest and other income (expe",

      "output": "### Analysis\n\n1. **Information Gathered:**\n   - For the \"cash from operations\" for FY2017, multiple outputs suggest a figure of $2.91 billion, with some citations supporting this value.\n   - For \"total current liabilities\" for FY2017, one output provides a figure of $3,527,457, with a citation indicating this is from the balance sheet section.\n\n2. **Sufficiency of Information:**\n   - We have a consistent figure for \"cash from operations\" at $2.91 billion.\n   - We have a figure for \"total current liabilities\" at $3,527,457, but this is less consistent across outputs and lacks strong corroboration.\n\n3. **Missing Information:**\n   - The \"total current liabilities\" figure is not strongly corroborated by multiple outputs or citations, which raises concerns about its accuracy.\n\n4. **Calculation:**\n   - If we assume the figures are correct, the operating cash flow ratio would be calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\$2.91 \\text{ billion}}{\\$3,527,457}\n     \\]\n   - This calculation would yield a ratio, but the lack of strong corroboration for the liabilities figure makes this calculation tentative.\n\n5. **Conflicting Answers:**\n   - The main conflict is in the reliability of the \"total current liabilities\" figure. The $3,527,457 figure is not strongly supported by multiple outputs or citations, which makes it difficult to confidently use it in the calculation.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile we have a consistent figure for \"cash from operations,\" the uncertainty around the \"total current liabilities\" figure means we cannot confidently calculate the operating cash flow ratio. Further verification of the liabilities figure is needed to ensure accuracy."

The technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may \nnever materialize, which could result in a loss of a substantial part of our initial investment in these companies. The evaluation of \nprivately held companies is based on information that we request from these companies, which is not subject to the same disclosure \nregulations as U.S. publicly traded companies, and as such, the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy \nof the data received from these companies. We have immaterial exposure on our long-term investments in privately held companies \nas these investments were insignificant as of December 1, 2017 and December 2, 2016. \n\n\nTable of Contents\n56\nITEM 8.

We record changes in \nthe intrinsic value of these cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in our Consolidated Balance \nSheets, until the forecasted transaction occurs. When the forecasted transaction occurs, we reclassify the related gain or loss on \nthe cash flow hedge to revenue. In the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur, or it becomes probable that it \nwill not occur, we reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) \nto interest and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income at that time.

In effect, the interest rate swaps \nconvert the fixed interest rate on our 2020 Notes to a floating interest rate based on the LIBOR. Under the terms of the swaps, we \nwill pay monthly interest at the one-month LIBOR rate plus a fixed number of basis points on the $900 million notional amount \nthrough February 1, 2020. In exchange, we will receive 4.75% fixed rate interest from the swap counterparties.

We record changes in \nthe intrinsic value of these cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in our Consolidated Balance \nSheets, until the forecasted transaction occurs. When the forecasted transaction occurs, we reclassify the related gain or loss on \nthe cash flow hedge to revenue. In the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur, or it becomes probable that it \nwill not occur, we reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) \nto interest and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income at that time. If we do not elect hedge \naccounting, or the contract does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the changes in fair value from period to period are \nrecorded in interest and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. \nFor fiscal 2017 and 2016, there were no net gains or losses recognized in other income relating to hedges of forecasted \ntransactions that did not occur.

In effect, the interest rate swaps \nconvert the fixed interest rate on our 2020 Notes to a floating interest rate based on the LIBOR. Under the terms of the swaps, we \nwill pay monthly interest at the one-month LIBOR rate plus a fixed number of basis points on the $900 million notional amount \nthrough February 1, 2020. In exchange, we will receive 4.75% fixed rate interest from the swap counterparties.

These events could cause large fluctuations in the balance of current and non-current \nassets, liabilities and income taxes payable. We believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either certain \naudits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. Given the uncertainties \ndescribed above, we can only determine a range of estimated potential decreases in underlying unrecognized tax benefits ranging \nfrom $0 to approximately $40 million. \n\n\nTable of Contents\nADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED\n NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n83\nSubsequent to December 1, 2017, the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” (the “Act”) was enacted and included broad tax reforms that \nare applicable to Adobe. Under the provisions of the Act, the U.S. corporate tax rate decreased from 35% to 21% effective January \n1, 2018, our undistributed foreign earnings are subject to taxation in fiscal 2018 and are available for repatriation, and our future \nforeign earnings are subject to U.S. taxation. These changes will require us to remeasure our deferred tax assets and liabilities and \nreclassify deferred tax liabilities related to undistributed foreign earnings to long-term income taxes payable due over eight years.\nNOTE 10.
