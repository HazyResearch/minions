--- Question ---
Does 3M have a reasonably healthy liquidity profile based on its quick ratio for Q2 of FY2023? If the quick ratio is not relevant to measure liquidity, please state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
Based on the available data, 3M's quick ratio for Q2 FY2023 appears to be 0.86, suggesting a potentially weak liquidity position. However, due to inconsistencies in the data, this conclusion should be verified with more reliable financial figures.

--- Ground Truth ---
["No. The quick ratio for 3M was 0.96 by Jun'23 close, which needs a bit of an improvement to touch the 1x mark"]
