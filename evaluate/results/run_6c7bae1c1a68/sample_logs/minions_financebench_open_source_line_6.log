--- Question ---
Does 3M have a reasonably healthy liquidity profile based on its quick ratio for Q2 of FY2023? If the quick ratio is not relevant to measure liquidity, please state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
3M's quick ratio for Q2 of FY2023 is approximately 0.85, indicating a less than healthy liquidity profile.

--- Ground Truth ---
["No. The quick ratio for 3M was 0.96 by Jun'23 close, which needs a bit of an improvement to touch the 1x mark"]

--- Correctness Evaluation ---
Is correct: False
Confidence: 0.80
Reasoning: The predicted answer states a quick ratio of 0.85, which is outside the 10% tolerance range of the ground truth quick ratio of 0.96 (acceptable range: 0.864 to 1.056). Additionally, both answers agree on the conclusion that 3M's liquidity profile is less than healthy, but the numerical discrepancy affects the correctness based on the evaluation rules.
