--- Question ---
Is CVS Health a capital-intensive business based on FY2022 data?

--- Predicted Answer ---
Yes, CVS Health is a capital-intensive business based on FY2022 data.

--- Ground Truth ---
["Yes, CVS Health requires an extensive asset base to operate, which is evident from its ROA of only 1.82% in 2022 and 3.39% in 2021, though it should be noted that a significant portion of this asset base is goodwill, and CVS's fixed assets/total assets ratio is on the lower side of 5.6%."]
