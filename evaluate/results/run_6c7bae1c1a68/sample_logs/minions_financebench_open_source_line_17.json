  "question": "Roughly how many times has AES Corporation sold its inventory in FY2022? Calculate inventory turnover ratio for the FY2022; if conventional inventory management is not meaningful for the company then state that and explain why.",
  "predicted_answer": "The inventory turnover ratio for AES Corporation in FY2022 cannot be calculated due to missing average inventory data. The Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) for FY2022 is approximately $10,069 million. However, AES Corporation operates in the energy sector, where conventional inventory management is not meaningful. The company focuses on energy generation and distribution, which does not involve traditional inventory management practices.",

    "AES has converted inventory 9.5 times in FY 2022."
