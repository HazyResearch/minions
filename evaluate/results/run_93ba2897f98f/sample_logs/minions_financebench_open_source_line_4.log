--- Question ---
What drove operating margin change as of FY2022 for 3M? If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then please state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
The operating margin for 3M decreased from 22.8% in 2021 to 20.8% in 2022, driven by increased costs from litigation, divestitures, PFAS exit costs, and economic pressures such as raw material inflation and supply chain constraints.

--- Ground Truth ---
['Operating Margin for 3M in FY2022 has decreased by 1.7% primarily due to: \n-Decrease in gross Margin\n-mostly one-off charges including Combat Arms Earplugs litigation, impairment related to exiting PFAS manufacturing, costs related to exiting Russia and divestiture-related restructuring\ncharges']

--- Correctness Evaluation ---
Is correct: True
Confidence: 0.90
Reasoning: The predicted answer correctly identifies the decrease in operating margin and attributes it to similar factors as the ground truth: litigation, divestitures, and PFAS exit costs. It also adds economic pressures like raw material inflation and supply chain constraints, which are reasonable additional factors. The numerical change in operating margin is within the 10% tolerance range.
