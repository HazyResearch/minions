  "predicted_answer": "Based on the available data, 3M's quick ratio for Q2 FY2023 appears to be 0.86, suggesting a potentially weak liquidity position. However, due to inconsistencies in the data, this conclusion should be verified with more reliable financial figures.",
  "ground_truth": [
    "No. The quick ratio for 3M was 0.96 by Jun'23 close, which needs a bit of an improvement to touch the 1x mark"
