--- Question ---
Has AMCOR's quick ratio improved or declined between FY2023 and FY2022? If the quick ratio is not something that a financial analyst would ask about a company like this, then state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
Based on the partial and conflicting data, it appears that AMCOR's quick ratio has declined from FY2022 to FY2023. However, more reliable data for FY2022 is needed to confirm this trend.

--- Ground Truth ---
['The quick ratio has slightly improved from 0.67 times to 0.69 times between FY 2023 and FY 2022.(3.4% jump)']

--- Correctness Evaluation ---
Is correct: False
Confidence: 0.90
Reasoning: The predicted answer states that AMCOR's quick ratio has declined, which contradicts the ground truth answer indicating an improvement from 0.67 to 0.69. The predicted answer also mentions the need for more reliable data, which is not aligned with the ground truth. Therefore, the prediction is incorrect.
