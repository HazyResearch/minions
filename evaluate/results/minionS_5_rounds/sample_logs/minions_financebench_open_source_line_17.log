--- Question ---
Roughly how many times has AES Corporation sold its inventory in FY2022? Calculate inventory turnover ratio for the FY2022; if conventional inventory management is not meaningful for the company then state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
The estimated inventory turnover ratio for AES Corporation in FY2022 is approximately 7.57.

--- Ground Truth ---
['AES has converted inventory 9.5 times in FY 2022.']

--- Correctness Evaluation ---
Is correct: False
Confidence: 0.80
Reasoning: The predicted answer provides an inventory turnover ratio of 7.57, which is outside the 10% tolerance range of the ground truth answer of 9.5 (acceptable range: 8.55 to 10.45). Therefore, the predicted answer is incorrect.
