--- Question ---
Based on the information provided primarily in the balance sheet and the statement of income, what is FY2020 days payable outstanding (DPO) for Corning? DPO is defined as: 365 * (average accounts payable between FY2019 and FY2020) / (FY2020 COGS + change in inventory between FY2019 and FY2020). Round your answer to two decimal places.

--- Predicted Answer ---
The FY2020 days payable outstanding (DPO) for Corning is calculated as follows: 

1. Average Accounts Payable = ((1,024 + 1,174) / 2 + (2,320 + 1,508) / 2) / 2 = 1,506.5M
2. Change in Inventory = ((1,139 - 2,438) + (7,772 - 503)) / 2 = 2,985M
3. DPO = 365 * 1,506.5 / (9,383 + 2,985) = 365 * 1,506.5 / 12,368 = 44.47 days

Therefore, the FY2020 DPO for Corning is 44.47 days.

--- Ground Truth ---
['63.86']

--- Correctness Evaluation ---
Is correct: False
Confidence: 0.90
Reasoning: The predicted answer calculates the DPO as 44.47 days, which is outside the 10% tolerance range of the ground truth answer of 63.86 days (57.47 to 70.25). Therefore, the predicted answer is incorrect.
