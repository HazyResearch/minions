--- Question ---
What drove operating margin change as of the FY22 for AMD? If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then please state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
AMD's operating margin decreased in FY22 due to increased costs from the Xilinx acquisition, charges in the Gaming and Client segments, and a decrease in operating income despite a 44% increase in revenue.

--- Ground Truth ---
["The decrease in AMD's operating income was primarily driven by amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition"]
