--- Question ---
Are Best Buy's gross margins historically consistent (not fluctuating more than roughly 2% each year)? If gross margins are not a relevant metric for a company like this, then please state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
Best Buy's overall and domestic gross margins are historically consistent, not fluctuating more than roughly 2% each year. However, the international segment's gross margins are not consistent, as they fluctuate more than 2% annually.

--- Ground Truth ---
['Yes, the margins have been consistent, there has been a minor decline of 1.1% in gross margins between FY2022 and FY2023.']
