--- Question ---
We want to calculate a financial metric. Please help us compute it by basing your answers off of the statement of income and the statement of cash flows. Here's the question: what is the FY2015 unadjusted EBITDA % margin for Netflix? Calculate unadjusted EBITDA using unadjusted operating income and D&A (from cash flow statement).

--- Predicted Answer ---
The unadjusted EBITDA % margin for Netflix in FY2015 is approximately 55.9%.

--- Ground Truth ---
['5.4%']

--- Correctness Evaluation ---
Is correct: False
Confidence: 1.00
Reasoning: The predicted answer of 55.9% is significantly outside the 10% tolerance range of the ground truth answer of 5.4%. The tolerance range would be 4.86% to 5.94%, and 55.9% is far beyond this range.
