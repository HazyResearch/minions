  "question": "What drove operating margin change as of FY2022 for 3M? If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then please state that and explain why.",
  "predicted_answer": "The operating margin for 3M in FY2022 decreased from 20.8% to 19.1%, driven by increased raw material and logistics costs, geopolitical impacts like the Russia-Ukraine conflict, strategic divestitures, and increased operating expenses due to litigation and restructuring costs.",
  "ground_truth": [
    "Operating Margin for 3M in FY2022 has decreased by 1.7% primarily due to: \n-Decrease in gross Margin\n-mostly one-off charges including Combat Arms Earplugs litigation, impairment related to exiting PFAS manufacturing, costs related to exiting Russia and divestiture-related restructuring\ncharges"

  "correctness_reasoning": "The predicted answer correctly identifies the decrease in operating margin and attributes it to increased costs and specific charges, which aligns with the ground truth. Both mention litigation and restructuring costs, and the predicted answer provides additional context about raw material costs and geopolitical impacts, which is acceptable."
