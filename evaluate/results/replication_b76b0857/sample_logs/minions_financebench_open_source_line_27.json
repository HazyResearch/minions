  "correctness_reasoning": "The predicted answer correctly states that AMCOR does not have an improving gross margin profile as of FY2023, aligning with the ground truth answer. The numerical values provided in the predicted answer (19.4% in 2022 to 18.5% in 2023) are consistent with the ground truth's indication of a 0.8% decline, which falls within the 10% tolerance rule. The lack of commentary on the relevance of gross margin does not contradict the ground truth, as it does not state that gross margin is irrelevant."
