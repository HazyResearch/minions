If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then please state that and explain why.\n\n---\n\nPlease provide succinct advice on the critical information we need to extract from the Financial document. Total length: 413989 characters to answer this question. \n\nAlso consider the following constraints:\n- In your response do NOT use numbered lists.\n- Do NOT structure your response as a sequence of steps.\n",
      "output": "To address the question about what drove the operating margin change for AMD as of FY22, focus on extracting key financial metrics and qualitative insights from the document. Look for sections discussing revenue growth, cost of goods sold, operating expenses, and any significant one-time charges or gains. Pay attention to management's commentary on market conditions, product launches, and competitive dynamics, as these can influence operating margins. Consider whether there were any strategic investments or acquisitions that impacted costs or revenue streams. If the document includes a comparison with previous fiscal years, this can provide context for changes in operating margin. Additionally, assess whether AMD's business model or industry characteristics make operating margin a less relevant metric, such as if the company is in a high-growth phase where reinvestment is prioritized over profitability."

      "prompt": "# Decomposition Round #1\n\nYou (the supervisor) cannot directly read the document(s). Instead, you can assign small, isolated tasks to a less capable worker model that sees only a single chunk of text at a time. Any cross-chunk or multi-document reasoning must be handled by you.\n\n## Your Job: Write Two Python Functions\n\n### FUNCTION #1: `prepare_jobs(context, prev_job_manifests, prev_job_outputs) -> List[JobManifest]`\n- Break the document(s) into chunks (using the provided chunking function, if needed). Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 12 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`. All **multi-chunk integration** or **global reasoning** is your responsibility here.\n- Return one **aggregated string** suitable for further supervisor inspection.\n\n\n\n## Relevant Pydantic Models\n\nThe following models are already in the global scope. **Do NOT redefine or re-import them.**\n\n### JobManifest Model\n```\nclass JobManifest(BaseModel):\n    chunk: str  # the actual text for the chunk of the document\n    task: str  # the actual task instruction for the small model\n    advice: str  # optional, any additional advice on how to perform the task\n\n    chunk_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    task_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    job_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n\n```\n\n### JobOutput Model\n```\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    citation: Optional[str]\n    answer: Optional[str]\n\n```\n\n## Function Signatures\n```\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        context (List[str]): A list of documents.

These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date hereof or as of the dates indicated in the statements and should not\nbe relied upon as predictions of future events, as we cannot assure you that the events or circumstances reflected in these statements will be achieved or will\noccur.

The forward-looking statements relate to, among other things: possible impact of future accounting rules on AMD’s consolidated\nfinancial statements; demand for AMD’s products; the growth, change and competitive landscape of the markets in which AMD participates; international sales\nwill continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future; that AMD’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment balances together\nwith the availability under that certain revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Agreement) made available to AMD and certain of its subsidiaries, our\ncommercial paper program, and our cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund AMD’s operations including capital expenditures and purchase\ncommitments over the next 12 months and beyond; AMD’s ability to obtain sufficient external financing on favorable terms, or at all; AMD’s expectation that\nbased on management’s current knowledge, the potential liability related to AMD’s current litigation will not have a material adverse effect on its financial\nposition, results of operation or cash flows; anticipated ongoing and increased costs related to enhancing and implementing information security controls; all\nunbilled accounts receivables are expected to be billed and collected within 12 months; revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations that are\nunsatisfied which will be recognized in the next 12 months; and a small number of customers will continue to account for a substantial part of AMD’s revenue in\nthe future.

In February 2022, we completed our strategic\nacquisition of Xilinx, Inc. (Xilinx) which expanded our technology and product portfolio to include adaptable hardware platforms that enable hardware\nacceleration and rapid innovation across a variety of technologies and established AMD in multiple embedded markets where we have traditionally not had a\nsignificant presence. We now offer Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), Adaptive SoCs, and Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform (ACAP) products.\nWith the acquisition of Xilinx, we have access to a new set of markets and customers, further strengthening and diversifying our business model. In May 2022,\nwe expanded our data center solutions capabilities with the acquisition of Pensando Systems, Inc. (Pensando). We now offer high-performance data\nprocessing units (DPUs) and a software stack that complements our existing products. With the Xilinx and Pensando acquisitions, we are well positioned to\nprovide the industry’s broadest set of leadership compute engines and accelerators to help enable best performance, security, flexibility and total cost of\nownership for leading-edge data centers.\nOur 2022 financial results reflect the strength of our diversified business model despite the challenging PC market conditions in the second half of 2022. Net\nrevenue for 2022 was $23.6 billion, an increase of 44% compared to 2021 net revenue of $16.4 billion. The increase in net revenue was driven by a 64%\nincrease in Data Center segment revenue primarily due to higher sales of our EPYC™ server processors, a 21% increase in Gaming segment revenue\nprimarily due to higher semi-custom product sales, and a significant increase in Embedded segment revenue from the prior year period driven by the inclusion\nof Xilinx embedded product sales. This growth was partially offset by a 10% decrease in Client segment revenue primarily due to lower processor shipments\ndriven by a weak PC market and significant inventory correction actions across the PC supply chain. Gross margin, as a percentage of net revenue for 2022,\nwas 45%, compared to 48% in 2021. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition.\nOperating income for 2022 was $1.3 billion compared to operating income of $3.6 billion for 2021. The decrease in operating income was primarily driven by\namortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition. Net income for 2022 was $1.3 billion compared to $3.2 billion in the prior year. The\ndecrease in net income was primarily driven by lower operating income.\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2022 were $5.9 billion, compared to $3.6 billion at the end of 2021.

The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make\nestimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis, including\nthose related to our revenue, inventories, business combination, goodwill, long-lived and intangible assets, and income taxes. We base our estimates on\nhistorical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for\nmaking judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Although actual results have historically been reasonably consistent with management’s\nexpectations, the actual results may differ from these estimates or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions.\nManagement believes the following critical accounting estimates are the most significant to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most\ndifficult, subjective and complex judgments.\nRevenue Allowances.  Revenue contracts with our customers include variable amounts which we evaluate under ASC 606-10-32-8 through 14 in order to\ndetermine the net amount of consideration to which we are entitled and which we recognize as revenue. We determine the net amount of consideration to\nwhich we are entitled by estimating the most likely amount of consideration we expect to receive from the customer after adjustments to the contract price for\nrights of return and rebates to our original equipment manufacturers (OEM) customers and rights of return, rebates and price protection on unsold merchandise\nto our distributor customers.\nWe base our determination of necessary adjustments to the contract price by reference to actual historical activity and experience, including actual historical\nreturns, rebates and credits issued to OEM and distributor customers adjusted, as applicable, to include adjustments, if any, for known events or current\neconomic conditions, or both.\nOur estimates of necessary adjustments for distributor price incentives and price protection on unsold products held by distributors are based on actual\nhistorical incentives provided to distributor customers and known future price movements based on our internal and external market data analysis.\nOur estimates of necessary adjustments for OEM price incentives utilize, in addition to known pricing agreements, actual historical rebate attainment rates and\nestimates of future OEM rebate program attainment based on internal and external market data analysis.\nWe offer incent",

Where funds provided for such programs can be estimated, we\nrecognize a reduction to revenue at the time the related revenue is recognized; otherwise, we recognize such reduction to revenue at the later of when: i) the\nrelated revenue transaction occurs; or ii) the program is offered. For transactions where we reimburse a customer for a portion of the customer’s cost to perform\nspecific product advertising or marketing and promotional activities, such amounts are recognized as a reduction to revenue unless they qualify for expense\nrecognition.\nWe also provide limited product return rights to certain OEMs and to most distribution customers. These return rights are generally limited to a contractual\npercentage of the customer’s prior quarter shipments, although, from time to time we may approve additional product returns beyond the contractual\narrangements based on the applicable facts and circumstances. In order to estimate adjustments to revenue to account for these returns, including product\nrestocking rights provided to distributor and OEM customers, we utilize relevant, trended actual historical product return rate information gathered, adjusted for\nactual known information or events, as applicable.\nOverall, our estimates of adjustments to contract price due to variable consideration under our contracts with OEM and distributor customers, based on our\nassumptions and include adjustments, if any, for known events, have been materially consistent with actual results; however, these estimates are subject to\nmanagement’s judgment and actual provisions could be different from our estimates and current provisions, resulting in future adjustments to our revenue and\noperating results.\n42\n\n\nTable of Contents\nInventory Valuation. We value inventory at standard cost, adjusted to approximate the lower of actual cost or estimated net realizable value using assumptions\nabout future demand and market conditions.

In determining excess or obsolescence reserves for products, we consider assumptions such as\nchanges in business and economic conditions, other-than-temporary decreases in demand for our products, and changes in technology or customer\nrequirements. In determining the lower of cost or net realizable value reserves, we consider assumptions such as recent historical sales activity and selling\nprices, as well as estimates of future selling prices. If in any period we anticipate a change in assumptions such as future demand or market conditions to be\nless favorable than our previous estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales, resulting in a negative\nimpact to our gross margin in that period.

We allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired\nbased on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is\nrecorded as goodwill. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets.\nSignificant estimates in valuing developed technology, in-process research and development, customer relationships and other identifiable intangible assets\ninclude, but are not limited to, expected future revenue growth rates and margins, future changes in technology, time to recreate customer relationships, useful\nlives, and discount rates.\nManagement's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a\nresult, actual results may differ from estimates. Allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable assets and liabilities affects our amortization expense, as\nacquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the useful life, whereas any indefinite lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortized.\nDuring the measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.\nGoodwill. Goodwill is the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred over the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection\nwith business combinations. Our reporting units are at the operating segment level. Our goodwill is contained within three reporting units: Data Center, Gaming\nand Embedded.\nWe perform our goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year and, if certain events or circumstances indicate that an\nimpairment loss may have been incurred, on a more frequent basis. The analysis may include both qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the likelihood\nof an impairment, which occurs when the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value.

The fair values of our reporting units are estimated using a combination of the income approach, which requires estimating the present value of expected\nfuture cash flows of a reporting unit, and the market approach, which uses financial ratios of comparable companies to arrive at an estimated value for the\nreporting unit. Significant estimates and assumptions used in the income approach include assessments of macroeconomic conditions, growth rates of our\nreporting units in the near- and long-term, expectations of our ability to execute on our roadmap and projections, and the discount rate applied to cash flows.\nSignificant estimates used in the market approach include the identification of comparable companies for each reporting unit, the determination of an\nappropriate control premium that a market participant would apply to a reporting unit, and the determination of appropriate multiples to apply to a reporting unit\nbased on adjustments and consideration of specific attributes of that reporting unit.\n43\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe most significant assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair values of our reporting units are the sales and earnings growth rates\n(including long-term growth rates) and discount rates. Long-term growth rates are dependent on overall market growth rates, the competitive environment and\ninflation. As a result, long-term growth rates could be adversely impacted by a sustained deceleration in category growth or an increased competitive\nenvironment. Discount rates, which are consistent with a weighted average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by a market participant, are based upon\nindustry required rates of return, including consideration of both debt and equity components of the capital structure. Our discount rates may be impacted by\nadverse changes in the macroeconomic environment, prolonged and continuing inflationary pressures, volatility in the equity and debt markets and other factors\nthat otherwise create or exacerbate risks in our reporting units. Changes in operating plans or adverse changes in the business or in the macroeconomic\nenvironment in the future could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair values and could result in a decline in fair value that would trigger future\nimpairment charges of our reporting units’ goodwill. Based on our annual impairment testing, the fair values of all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying\nvalues.\nLong-Lived and Intangible Assets. Long-lived and intangible assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment if indicators of potential impairment exist\nand at least annually for indefinite-lived intangible assets. Impairment indicators are reviewed on a quarterly basis. Assets are grouped and evaluated for\nimpairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. When indi",

In the event such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the recorded value of the assets, the\nassets are written down to their estimated fair values based on the expected discounted future cash flows attributable to the asset group or based on\nappraisals. Factors affecting impairment of assets held for use include the ability of the specific assets to generate separately identifiable positive cash flows.\nWhen assets are removed from operations and held for sale, we estimate impairment losses as the excess of the carrying value of the assets over their fair\nvalue. Market conditions are among the factors affecting impairment of assets held for sale. Changes in any of these factors could necessitate impairment\nrecognition in future periods for assets held for use or assets held for sale.\nIncome Taxes. In determining taxable income for financial statement reporting purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and\njudgments are applied in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets which arise from temporary\ndifferences between the recognition of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement reporting purposes.\nWe regularly assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. Unless recovery is considered more-likely-than-not (a probability level\nof more than 50%), we will record a charge to income tax expense in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not\nultimately be recoverable or maintain the valuation allowance recorded in prior periods. When considering all available evidence, if we determine it is more-\nlikely-than-not we will realize our deferred tax assets, we will reverse some or all of the existing valuation allowance, which would result in a credit to income tax\nexpense and the establishment of an asset in the period of reversal.\nIn determining the need to establish or maintain a valuation allowance, we consider the four sources of jurisdictional taxable income: (i) carryback of net\noperating losses to prior years; (ii) future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences; (iii) viable and prudent tax planning strategies; and (iv) future\ntaxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards.\nThrough the end of 2022, we continue to maintain a valuation allowance of approximately $2.1 billion for certain federal, state, and foreign tax attributes. The\nfederal valuation allowance maintained is due to limitations, under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 or 383, separate return loss year rules, or dual\nconsolidated loss rules. Certain state and foreign valuation allowances are maintained due to a lack of sufficient sources of future taxable income.\nIn addition, the c",

The percentage of cash and cash equivalents held domestically was 73% as of\nDecember 31, 2022, and 91% as of December 25, 2021.\nOur operating, investing and financing cash flow activities for 2022 and 2021 were as follows:\nDecember 31, 2022\nDecember 25, 2021\n \n(In millions)\nNet cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities\n$\n3,565 \n$\n3,521 \nInvesting activities\n1,999 \n(686)\nFinancing activities\n(3,264)\n(1,895)\nNet increase in cash and cash equivalents\n$\n2,300 \n$\n940 \nOur aggregate principal debt obligations were $2.5 billion as of December 31, 2022, which consisted primarily of $1.5 billion of the Xilinx Notes assumed as part\nof the Xilinx acquisition and $1.0 billion of 3.924% Notes and 4.393% Notes issued during the year, compared to $313 million as of December 25, 2021,\nrespectively. We repaid $312 million of our 7.50% Senior Notes that matured in August 2022.\nOn April 29, 2022, we entered into a revolving credit agreement (Revolving Credit Agreement) with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. as administrative agent and other\nbanks identified therein as lenders. The Revolving Credit Agreement provides for a five-year unsecured revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal\namount of $3.0 billion. There were no funds drawn from this facility during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nOn November 3, 2022, we established a new commercial paper program where we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum principal\namount outstanding at any time of $3.0 billion with a maturity of up to 397 days from the date of issue. The commercial paper will be sold at a discount from par\nor, alternatively, will be sold at par and bear interest at rates that will vary based on market conditions at the time of issuance.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK    \nInterest Rate Risk. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and long-term debt. We usually invest\nour cash in investments with short maturities or with frequent interest reset terms. Accordingly, our interest income fluctuates with short-term market conditions.\nAs of December 31, 2022, our investment portfolio consisted of fixed income instruments, time deposits and commercial paper. Our primary aim with our\ninvestment portfolio is to invest available cash while preserving principal and meeting liquidity needs. In accordance with our investment policy, we place\ninvestments with high credit quality issuers and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer based upon the issuer's credit rating. These securities are\nsubject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase. A hypothetical 50 basis-point (half percentage point) increase or\ndecrease in interest rates compared to rates at December 31, 2022 would have affected the fair value of our cash equ",

Consequently, our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates\non reported interest expense and corresponding cash flows is minimal.\nWe will continue to monitor our exposure to interest rate risk.\nDefault Risk. We mitigate default risk in our investment portfolio by investing in only high credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to\nrespond to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. Our portfolio includes investments in marketable debt securities with\nactive secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity. We are averse to principal loss and strive to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk\nand market risk.\nWe actively monitor market conditions and developments specific to the securities and security classes in which we invest. We believe that we take a\nconservative approach to investing our funds in that we invest only in highly-rated debt securities with relatively short maturities and do not invest in securities\nwhich we believe involve a higher degree of risk. As of December 31, 2022, substantially all of our investments in debt securities were A-rated by at least one of\nthe rating agencies. While we believe we take prudent measures to mitigate investment-related risks, such risks cannot be fully eliminated as there are\ncircumstances outside of our control.\nForeign Exchange Risk. As a result of our foreign operations, we incur costs and we carry assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies,\nwhile sales of products are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars.\nWe maintain a foreign currency hedging strategy which uses derivative financial instruments to mitigate the risks associated with changes in foreign currency\nexchange rates.

Fiscal 2022 consisted of 53 weeks, and fiscal 2021 and 2020 each consisted of 52 weeks.\nPrinciples of Consolidation.  The consolidated financial statements include the Company’s accounts and those of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Upon\nconsolidation, all inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated.\nReclassification. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.\nUse of Estimates. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requires\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of commitments and contingencies at\nthe date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results are likely to differ from\nthose estimates, and such differences may be material to the financial statements. Areas where management uses subjective judgment include, but are not\nlimited to, revenue allowances, inventory valuation, valuation of goodwill and long-lived and intangible assets, and income taxes.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration which the\nCompany expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Sales, value-added, and other taxes collected concurrently with the provision of goods or\nservices are excluded from revenue. Shipping and handling costs associated with product sales are included in cost of sales. Substantially all the Company’s\nrevenue is derived from product sales, representing a single performance obligation.\nCustomers are generally required to pay for products and services within the Company’s standard contractual terms, which are typically net 30 to 60 days. The\nCompany has determined that it does not have significant financing components in its contracts with customers.\nNon-custom products\nThe Company transf",

Non-custom product arrangements generally comprise a single\nperformance obligation. Certain OEMs may be entitled to rights of return and rebates under OEM agreements. The Company also sells to distributors under\nterms allowing the majority of distributors certain rights of return and price protection on unsold merchandise held by them. The Company estimates the amount\nof variable consideration under OEM and distributor arrangements and, accordingly, records a provision for product returns, allowances for price protection and\nrebates based on actual historical experience and any known events.\n57\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe Company offers incentive programs to certain customers, including cooperative advertising, marketing promotions, volume-based incentives and special\npricing arrangements. Where funds provided for such programs can be estimated, the Company recognizes a reduction to revenue at the time the related\nrevenue is recognized; otherwise, the Company recognizes such reduction to revenue at the later of when: i) the related revenue transaction occurs; or ii) the\nprogram is offered. For transactions where the Company reimburses a customer for a portion of the customer’s cost to perform specific product advertising or\nmarketing and promotional activities, such amounts are recognized as a reduction to revenue unless they qualify for expense recognition.\nConstraints of variable consideration have not been material.\nCustom products\nCustom products which are associated with the Company’s Gaming segment (semi-custom products), sold under non-cancellable purchases orders, for which\nthe Company has an enforceable right to payment, and which have no alternative use to the Company at contract inception, are recognized as revenue, over\nthe time of production of the products by the Company. The Company utilizes a cost-based input method, calculated as cost incurred plus estimated margin, to\ndetermine the amount of revenue to recognize for in-process, but incomplete, customer orders at a reporting date. The Company believes that a cost-based\ninput method is the most appropriate manner to measure how the Company satisfies its performance obligations to customers because the effort and costs\nincurred best depict the Company’s satisfaction of its performance obligation.\nSales of semi-custom products are not subject to a right of return. Custom products arrangements generally involve a single performance obligation.

A licensing component is distinct if it is both (i) capable of being distinct and (ii) distinct in the context of the arrangement. If the\nlicense is not distinct, it is combined with the development services as a single performance obligation and recognized over time. If the license is distinct,\nrevenue is recognized at a point in time when the customer has the ability to benefit from the license.\nFrom time to time, the Company may enter into arrangements with customers that solely involve the sale or licensing of its patents or IP. Generally, there are no\nperformance obligations beyond transferring the designated license to the Company’s patents or IP. Accordingly, revenue is recognized at a point in time when\nthe customer has the ability to benefit from the license.\nThere are no variable consideration estimates associated with either combined development and IP arrangements or for standalone arrangements involving\neither the sale or licensing of IP.\nInventories\nThe Company values inventory at standard cost, adjusted to approximate the lower of actual cost or estimated net realizable value using assumptions about\nfuture demand and market conditions. In determining excess or obsolescence reserves for its products, the Company considers assumptions such as changes\nin business and economic conditions, other-than-temporary decreases in demand for its products, and changes in technology or customer requirements. In\ndetermining the lower of cost or net realizable value reserves, the Company considers assumptions such as recent historical sales activity and selling prices, as\nwell as estimates of future selling prices.

When determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially\nwith respect to intangible assets. Critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, expected future revenue growth rates and\nmargins, future changes in technology, time to recreate customer relationships, useful lives, and discount rates. Fair value estimates are based on the\nassumptions that management believes a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability. These estimates are inherently uncertain and, therefore,\nactual results may differ from the estimates made. As a result, during the measurement period of up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may\nrecord adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or\nfinal determination of the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded in the\nConsolidated Statements of Operations.\nGoodwill\nThe Company performs its goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year and, if certain events or circumstances indicate that\nan impairment loss may have been incurred, on a more frequent basis. The analysis may include both qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the\nlikelihood of an impairment.\nThe Company has the option to first perform qualitative testing to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying\namount. Qualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, share price trends and market capitalization and\nCompany-specific events. If the Company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, the Company\ndoes not proceed to perform a quantitative impairment test.\nIf the Company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value or elects to bypass the qualitative test, a\nquantitative goodwill impairment test will be performed by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. The Company’s quantitative\nimpairment analysis uses a combination of the income approach, which requires estimates of the present value of expected future cash flows of a reporting\nunit, and the market approach, which uses financial ratios of comparable companies to arrive at an estimated value for the reporting units. Significant estimates\nand assumptions used in the income approach include assessments of macroeconomic conditions, growth rates of reporting units in the near- and long-term,\nexpectations of the Company’s ability to execute on roadmaps and projections, and the discount rate applied to cash flows.

Significant estimates used in the\nmarket approach include the identification of comparable companies for each reporting unit, and the determination of the appropriate multiples to apply to a\nreporting unit based on adjustments and consideration of specific attributes of that reporting unit. If a reporting unit’s fair value is determined to be less than its\ncarrying value, a goodwill impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying value, not to exceed\nthe total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nLong-Lived and Intangible Assets\nLong-lived and intangible assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment if indicators of potential impairment exist and at least annually for indefinite-\nlived intangible assets. Impairment indicators are reviewed on a quarterly basis. Assets are grouped and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level of\nidentifiable cash flows.\nWhen indicators of impairment exist and assets are held for use, the Company estimates future undiscounted cash flows attributable to the related asset\ngroups. In the event such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the recorded value of the assets, the assets are written down to their estimated\nfair values based on the expected discounted future cash flows attributable to the asset group or based on appraisals. Factors affecting impairment of assets\nheld for use include the ability of the specific assets to generate separately identifiable positive cash flows.\nWhen assets are removed from operations and held for sale, the Company estimates impairment losses as the excess of the carrying value of the assets over\ntheir fair value. Market conditions are among the factors affecting impairment of assets held for sale. Changes in any of these factors could necessitate\nimpairment recognition in future periods for assets held for use or assets held for sale.\n59\n\n\nTable of Contents\nCash Equivalents\nCash equivalents consist of financial instruments that are readily convertible into cash and have original maturities of three months or less at the time of\npurchase.\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable are primarily comprised of trade receivables presented net of rebates, price protection and an allowance for credit loss.

The Company does not believe the receivable balance from its customers represents a significant credit\nrisk.\nInvestments\nAvailable for Sale Debt Securities. The Company classifies its investments in debt securities at the date of acquisition as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale\ndebt securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a\ncomponent of stockholders’ equity. If an available-for-sale debt security’s fair value is less than its amortized cost basis, then the Company evaluates whether\nthe decline is the result of a credit loss, in which case an impairment is recorded through an allowance for credit losses. Unrealized gains and losses not\nattributable to credit losses are included, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders’ equity. Classification of\navailable-for-sale debt securities as current or non-current is based on the Company’s intent and belief in its ability to sell these securities and use the proceeds\nfrom sale in operations within 12 months.\nNon-marketable Securities. The Company’s investments in non-marketable securities of privately-held companies are accounted for under the measurement\nalternative, defined as cost, less impairments, adjusted for subsequent observable price changes and are periodically assessed for impairment when events or\ncircumstances indicate that a decline in value may have occurred. The Company's periodic assessment of impairment is made by considering available\nevidence, including the investee’s general market and industry conditions and product development status. The Company also assesses the investee’s ability to\nmeet business milestones, its financial condition, and near-term prospects, including the rate at which the investee is using its cash, the investee’s need for\npossible additional funding at a lower valuation and any bona fide offer to purchase the investee.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company’s financial instruments are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, except for non-marketable equity investments in privately-\nheld companies, which are generally accounted for under the measurement alternative.\nFair Value Hierarchy\nThe fair value framework requires the categorization of assets and liabilities into three levels based upon the assumptions (inputs) used to price the assets or\nliabilities.

Depreciation and amortization are provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of one to 15 years\nfor equipment, 34 to 44 years for buildings, and leasehold improvements are measured by the shorter of the remaining terms of the leases or the estimated\nuseful economic lives of the improvements.\nLeases\nOperating and finance leases are recorded as right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities on the Company’s balance sheet. ROU assets represent the\nCompany’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the\nlease. Operating and finance lease ROU assets and liabilities are initially recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. In\ndetermining the present value of lease payments, the Company uses the implicit interest rate if readily determinable. When the implicit interest rate is not\nreadily determinable, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate, which is based on its collateralized borrowing capabilities over a similar term of the\nlease payments. The Company utilizes the consolidated group incremental borrowing rate for all leases as the Company has centralized treasury operations.\nLease expense for operating lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company has elected the accounting policy to not\nrecognize ROU assets and lease liabilities that arise from short-term (12 months or less) leases for any class of underlying asset.

As a result of the acquisition, the Company recorded\n$27.3 billion of identified intangible assets (refer to Note 5 - Business Combinations), of which $16.9 billion are related to foreign operations which will be\namortized to income from operations over the assets’ estimated useful lives, but for which the Company will not receive a tax deduction under GI",

This\naccounting policy change resulted in the recording of $857 million of deferred tax liabilities in connection with the Xilinx acquisition as disclosed in Note 14 -\nIncome Taxes. In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2022, it resulted in a decrease in the income tax provision with a corresponding increase to net\nincome of $296 million and an increase in basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.19, as compared to the computation under the previous accounting policy.\nThis accounting policy change had no material impact on the Company’s historical consolidated financial statements.\n62\n\n\nTable of Contents\nAccrued Interest on Unrecognized Tax Benefits. Prior to 2022, the Company reported any interest expense related to unrecognized tax benefits as a\ncomponent of Interest expense and reported any related penalties as a component of Income tax provision (benefit). In 2022, the Company elected to change\nits method of accounting for tax interest expense from Interest expense to the Income tax provision (benefit) line in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThis change in classification is considered preferable as it i) better aligns classification of tax interest with the substance of the underlying tax positions, which\nare managed inclusive of interest, ii) allows for greater visibility to the cost of the Company’s debt and other financing activities, and iii) better aligns with\ncommon industry practice and provides increased comparability. This accounting policy change resulted in a decrease in Interest expense and corresponding\nincrease to i) Income before income taxes and equity income and ii) Income tax provision (benefit) as reported on the Consolidated Statements of Operations of\n$11 million in 2022.

The\nexercise price of each option granted under the 2004 Plan must be paid in full at the time of the exercise.\nTime-based RSUs.

The capitalization resulted in an increase in 2022 taxable income which also increased the income eligible for the FDII tax\nbenefit.

The\ndifference between the amount of federal NOLs which are recorded on the Company’s balance sheet as deferred tax assets and their related valuation\nallowance, and the amounts reported on the Company’s tax returns are the result of uncertain tax positions the Company has taken during the current year and\nfor which an income tax reserve has been recorded.

Auditing management’s inventory carrying value adjustments involved\nsignificant judgment because the estimates are based on several factors that are affected by market, industry, and competitive\nconditions outside the Company's control. In estimating inventory carrying value adjustments, management developed\nassumptions such as forecasts of future sales quantities and the selling prices, which are sensitive to the competitiveness of\nproduct offerings, customer requirements, and product life cycles.

(“Xilinx”) for consideration of $48.8 billion, as\ndisclosed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination.\nAuditing the Company's accounting for its acquisition of Xilinx was complex due to the significant estimation uncertainty in the\nCompany’s determination of the fair value of certain identified intangible assets, principally consisting of developed technology\nand customer relationships. The significant estimation uncertainty was primarily due to the sensitivity of the respective fair values\nto underlying assumptions about the future performance of the acquired business. The Company used a discounted cash flow\nmodel to measure the developed technology and customer relationship intangible assets.

A company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect\nthe transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being\nmade only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or\ntimely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n93\n\n\nTable of Contents\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance\nwith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nSan Jose, California\nFebruary 27, 2023\n94\n\n\nTable of Contents\nITEM 9.

      "output": "From the collected outputs, we have gathered several pieces of information related to AMD's operating margin changes for FY22:\n\n1. **Amortization of Intangible Assets**: A significant driver of the decrease in operating income was the amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition. This suggests that acquisition-related costs had a substantial impact on the operating margin.\n\n2. **Segment Performance**: The Data Center segment saw an increase in operating income due to higher revenue from EPYC server processors, while the Client segment experienced a decrease in operating margin due to lower revenue and higher operating expenses, driven by challenging PC market conditions.\n\n3. **Increased Expenses**: There was a notable increase in research and development expenses (76% increase) and marketing, general, and administrative expenses (61% increase), which likely contributed to a decrease in operating margin.\n\n4. **Revenue Growth**: Despite the challenges, AMD's net revenue increased from $16,434 million in 2021 to $23,601 million in 2022, indicating strong top-line growth.\n\n5. **Impact of Acquisitions**: The acquisition of Xilinx and its integration into AMD's financials played a significant role in the financial results, with acquisition-related costs impacting the operating margin.\n\n6. **Other Factors**: The company's operating results were also influenced by factors such as seasonality, competitive pressures, and macroeconomic conditions.\n\nThe information gathered is sufficient to answer the question about what drove the operating margin change for AMD in FY22. The primary factors include the amortization of intangible assets from the Xilinx acquisition, increased operating expenses, and segment-specific performance variations. The operating margin decreased from 22.2% in 2021 to 5.4% in 2022, primarily due to these factors.\n\nThere are no conflicting answers, as the information consistently points to the same drivers of operating margin change. The citations provided support these findings, particularly the impact of the Xilinx acquisition and increased expenses."
