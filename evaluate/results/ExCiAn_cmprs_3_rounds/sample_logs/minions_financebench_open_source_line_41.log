--- Question ---
Does AMEX have an improving operating margin profile as of 2022? If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
Operating margin is not a useful metric for AMEX as of 2022. Instead, metrics such as Return on Equity (ROE), Return on Assets (ROA), and Net Interest Margin (NIM) are more relevant for assessing the company's financial performance. The gathered information does not provide a consistent or reliable operating margin figure, reinforcing the idea that other financial metrics are more appropriate for evaluating AMEX.

--- Ground Truth ---
['Performance is not measured through operating margin']

--- Correctness Evaluation ---
Is correct: True
Confidence: 1.00
Reasoning: The predicted answer correctly states that operating margin is not a useful metric for AMEX, aligning with the ground truth answer. It also provides additional context by suggesting more relevant metrics for evaluating AMEX's financial performance, which is acceptable according to the evaluation rules.
