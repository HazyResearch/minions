  "question": "Does Verizon have a reasonably healthy liquidity profile based on its quick ratio for FY 2022? If the quick ratio is not relevant to measure liquidity, please state that and explain why.",
  "predicted_answer": "The quick ratio cannot be accurately calculated due to the lack of specific figures for current assets excluding inventory and current liabilities. Therefore, we cannot determine if Verizon has a reasonably healthy liquidity profile based on its quick ratio for FY 2022.",
  "ground_truth": [
    "No. The quick ratio was approximately 0.54 for Verizon. It indicated that Verizon does not have a healthy liquidity profile."

  "correctness_reasoning": "The predicted answer states that the quick ratio cannot be calculated due to lack of specific figures, which contradicts the ground truth answer that provides a specific quick ratio value of 0.54. The ground truth concludes that Verizon does not have a healthy liquidity profile based on this ratio, while the predicted answer does not make a determination. Therefore, the predicted answer does not align with the ground truth."
