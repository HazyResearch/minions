Are JPM's gross margins historically consistent (not fluctuating more than roughly 2% each year)? If gross margins are not a relevant metric for a company like this, then please state that and explain why.

Gross margins are not a relevant metric for JPMorgan Chase. Instead, focus on net interest margin, ROA, and ROE.

--- Correctness Evaluation ---
Is correct: True
Confidence: 1.00
