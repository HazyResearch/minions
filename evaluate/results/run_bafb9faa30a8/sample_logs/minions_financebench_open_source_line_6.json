  "question": "Does 3M have a reasonably healthy liquidity profile based on its quick ratio for Q2 of FY2023? If the quick ratio is not relevant to measure liquidity, please state that and explain why.",
  "predicted_answer": "Due to fragmented and inconsistent data for current assets and the need for verification of current liabilities, it is not possible to accurately calculate 3M's quick ratio for Q2 of FY2023. Therefore, we cannot definitively assess 3M's liquidity profile based on the quick ratio.",
  "ground_truth": [
    "No. The quick ratio for 3M was 0.96 by Jun'23 close, which needs a bit of an improvement to touch the 1x mark"
