The increase in cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales was driven by one-time COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing exit costs, currency impacts in the Pharmaceutical segment, and commodity inflation in the MedTech and Consumer Health segments. These were partially offset by supply chain benefits in the Consumer Health segment.

However, specific figures for the gross margin change in FY2022 were not provided.
