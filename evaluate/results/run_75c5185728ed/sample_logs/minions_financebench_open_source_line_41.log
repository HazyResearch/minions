--- Question ---
Does AMEX have an improving operating margin profile as of 2022? If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
AMEX's operating margin for 2022 is not explicitly stated, and calculated figures vary. The most frequently mentioned range is between 18.0% and 19.65%. There is no consistent evidence of an improving operating margin profile. The document does not discuss the relevance of operating margin as a key metric, suggesting it may not be the most useful metric for AMEX.

--- Ground Truth ---
['Performance is not measured through operating margin']
