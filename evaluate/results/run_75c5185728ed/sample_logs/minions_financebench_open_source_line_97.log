--- Question ---
Are JPM's gross margins historically consistent (not fluctuating more than roughly 2% each year)? If gross margins are not a relevant metric for a company like this, then please state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
Gross margin is not a relevant metric for JPMorgan Chase, as it is a financial institution. Instead, metrics like net interest margin, return on assets, return on equity, and efficiency ratio are more appropriate. Unfortunately, the document does not provide sufficient historical data on these metrics to determine their consistency.

--- Ground Truth ---
['Since JPM is a financial institution, gross margin is not a relevant metric.']
