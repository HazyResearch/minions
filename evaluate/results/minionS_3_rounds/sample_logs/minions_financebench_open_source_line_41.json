  "question": "Does AMEX have an improving operating margin profile as of 2022? If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then state that and explain why.",
  "predicted_answer": "AMEX's operating margin for 2022 is not explicitly stated, and calculated figures vary. The most frequently mentioned range is between 18.0% and 19.65%. There is no consistent evidence of an improving operating margin profile. The document does not discuss the relevance of operating margin as a key metric, suggesting it may not be the most useful metric for AMEX.",

  "correctness_reasoning": "The predicted answer aligns with the ground truth by indicating that operating margin is not explicitly stated as a key performance metric for AMEX. It also suggests that operating margin may not be the most useful metric for AMEX, which is consistent with the ground truth's assertion that performance is not measured through operating margin. The additional context provided does not contradict the ground truth."
