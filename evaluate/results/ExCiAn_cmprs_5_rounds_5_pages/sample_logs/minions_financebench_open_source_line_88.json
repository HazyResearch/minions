  "correctness_reasoning": "The predicted answer states an inventory turnover ratio of approximately 1, which is outside the 10% tolerance range of the ground truth answer of 2.7 (acceptable range: 2.43 to 2.97). Additionally, the predicted answer suggests that conventional inventory management may not be meaningful, but does not provide a clear explanation for this claim, which is required if deviating from the numerical answer."
