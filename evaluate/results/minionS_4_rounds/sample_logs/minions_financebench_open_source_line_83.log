--- Question ---
By drawing conclusions from the information stated only in the statement of financial position, what is General Mills's FY2020 working capital ratio? Define working capital ratio as total current assets divided by total current liabilities. Round your answer to two decimal places.

--- Predicted Answer ---
The working capital ratio for General Mills's FY2020 is 0.87.

--- Ground Truth ---
['0.68']

--- Correctness Evaluation ---
Is correct: False
Confidence: 0.90
Reasoning: The ground truth answer for the working capital ratio is 0.68, while the predicted answer is 0.87. Applying a 10% tolerance to the ground truth (0.68), the acceptable range is 0.612 to 0.748. The predicted answer of 0.87 falls outside this range, making it incorrect.
