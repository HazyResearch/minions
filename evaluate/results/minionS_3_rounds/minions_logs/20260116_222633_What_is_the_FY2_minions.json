      "output": "To determine the FY2017 return on assets (ROA) for Coca Cola, focus on extracting specific financial data from the document. You need the net income for FY2017, which can be found in the profit and loss (P&L) statement. Additionally, gather the total assets for both FY2016 and FY2017 from the balance sheet. Calculate the average total assets by adding the total assets for FY2016 and FY2017 and dividing by two. With these figures, compute the ROA by dividing the FY2017 net income by the average total assets. Ensure the final result is rounded to two decimal places."

Instead, you can assign small, isolated tasks to a less capable worker model that sees only a single chunk of text at a time.

Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 12 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`. All **multi-chunk integration** or **global reasoning** is your responsibility here.\n- Return one **aggregated string** suitable for further supervisor inspection.\n\n\n\n## Relevant Pydantic Models\n\nThe following models are already in the global scope. **Do NOT redefine or re-import them.**\n\n### JobManifest Model\n```\nclass JobManifest(BaseModel):\n    chunk: str  # the actual text for the chunk of the document\n    task: str  # the actual task instruction for the small model\n    advice: str  # optional, any additional advice on how to perform the task\n\n    chunk_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    task_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    job_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n\n```\n\n### JobOutput Model\n```\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    citation: Optional[str]\n    answer: Optional[str]\n\n```\n\n## Function Signatures\n```\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        context (List[str]): A list of documents.

In total, we expect to recover the value of the intangible assets transferred to the bottlers under the CBAs through the future quarterly\npayments; however, as the payments for the territory rights are dependent on the bottlers' future gross profit in these territories, they are considered a form of contingent\nconsideration.\nThere is diversity in practice as it relates to the accounting for contingent consideration by the seller. The seller can account for the future contingent payments received as a gain\ncontingency, recognizing the amounts in the income statement only after the related contingencies are resolved and the gain is realized, which in this arrangement will be\nquarterly as the bottlers earn gross profit in the transferred territories. Alternatively, the seller can record a receivable for the contingent consideration at fair value on the date of\nsale and record any future differences between the payments received and this receivable in the income statement as they occur.

Our commercial paper program was rated \"A-1+\" by Standard &\nPoor's and \"P-1\" by Moody's. In assessing our credit strength, both agencies consider our capital structure (including the amount and maturity dates of our debt) and financial\npolicies as well as the aggregated balance sheet and other financial information of the Company.

It is our expectation that the credit rating agencies will continue using this methodology. If our credit ratings were to be downgraded as a\nresult of changes in our capital structure, our major bottlers' financial performance, changes in the credit rating agencies' methodology in assessing our credit strength, or for\nany other reason, our cost of borrowing could increase. Additionally, if certain bottlers' credit ratings were to decline, the Company's equity income could be reduced as a result\nof the potential increase in interest expense for those bottlers.\nWe monitor our financial ratios and, as indicated above, the rating agencies consider these ratios in assessing our credit ratings.

These\nguarantees have various terms, and none of these guarantees was individually significant. The amount represents the maximum potential future payments that we could be\nrequired to make under the guarantees; however, we do not consider it probable that we will be required to satisfy these guarantees. Management has concluded that the\nlikelihood of any significant amounts being paid by our Company under these guarantees is not probable. As of December 31, 2017, we were not directly liable for the debt of\nany unconsolidated entity, and we did not have any retained or contingent interest in assets as defined above.\nOur Company recognizes all derivatives as either assets or liabilities at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets.

Refer to Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Foreign currency exchange gains and losses are included as a component of other income\n(loss) — net in our consolidated financial statements. Refer to the heading \"Operations Review — Other Income (Loss) — Net\" above. The Company recorded foreign currency\nexchange losses of $57 million in 2017, foreign currency exchange losses of $246 million in 2016 and foreign currency exchange gains of $149 million in 2015.\nHyperinflationary Economies\nA hyperinflationary economy is one that has cumulative inflation of 100 percent or more over a three-year period. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, local subsidiaries in\nhyperinflationary economies are required to use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency and remeasure the monetary assets and liabilities not denominated in U.S. dollars\nusing the rate applicable to conversion of a currency for purposes of dividend remittances. All exchange gains and losses resulting from remeasurement are recognized currently\nin income.\nVenezuela has been designated as a hyperinflationary economy. In February 2015, the Venezuelan government introduced a new open market exchange rate system, SIMADI.\nAs a result, we remeasured the net monetary assets of our Venezuelan subsidiary, resulting in a charge of $27 million recorded in the line item other income (loss) — net in our\nconsolidated statement of income.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, the Venezuelan government devalued its currency and changed its official and most preferential exchange rate, which should be\nused for purchases of certain essential goods, to 10 bolivars per U.S. dollar from 6.3. The official and most preferential rate is now known as DIPRO and the former official rate\nhas been eliminated. The Venezuelan government replaced the SIMADI rate with the DICOM rate, which is allowed to float freely and is expected to fluctuate based on supply\nand demand. As a result, management determined that the DICOM rate was the most appropriate legally available rate to remeasure the net monetary assets of our Venezuelan\nsubsidiary.\nIn addition, we sell concentrate to our bottling partner in Venezuela from outside the country. These sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. During the years ended December 31,\n2016 and December 31, 2015, as a result of the continued lack of liquidity and our revised assessment of the U.S. dollar value we expect to realize upon the conversion of\nVenezuelan bolivars into U.S. dollars by our bottling partner to pay our concentrate sales receivables, we recorded write-downs of $76 million and $56 million, respectively.\nThese write-downs were recorded in the line item other operating charges in our consolidated statements of income.\nWe also have certain U.S. dollar",

These charges were recorded in the line item other operating\ncharges in our consolidated statements of income.

As CCBA met the criteria for held for sale upon consolidation, we have presented the financial position and results\nof operations of CCBA as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery of products has occurred, the sales price charged is fixed or determinable, and\ncollectibility is reasonably assured. For our Company, this generally means that we recognize revenue when title to our products is transferred to our bottling partners, resellers\nor other customers. In particular, title usually transfers upon shipment to or receipt at our customers' locations, as determined by the specific sales terms of the transactions. Our\nsales terms do not allow for a right of return except for matters related to any manufacturing defects on our part.\nDeductions from Revenue\nOur customers can earn certain incentives including, but not limited to, cash discounts, funds for promotional and marketing activities, volume-based incentive programs and\nsupport for infrastructure programs. The costs associated with these incentives are included in deductions from revenue, a component of net operating revenues in our\nconsolidated statements of income. For customer incentives that must be earned, management must make estimates related to the contractual terms, customer performance and\nsales volume to determine the total amounts earned and to be recorded in deductions from revenue. In making these estimates, management considers past results. The actual\namounts ultimately paid may be different from our estimates.\nIn some situations, the Company may determine it to be advantageous to make advance payments to specific customers to fund certain marketing activities intended to generate\nprofitable volume and/or invest in infrastructure programs with our bottlers that are directed at strengthening our bottling system and increasing unit case volume.

These changes in market conditions may adversely impact the Company's financial\nperformance and are referred to as \"market risks.\" When deemed appropriate, our Company uses derivatives as a risk management tool to mitigate the potential impact of\ncertain market risks. The primary market risks managed by the Company through the use of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments are foreign currency exchange\nrate risk, commodity price risk and interest rate risk.\nThe Company uses various types of derivative instruments including, but not limited to, forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, option contracts, collars and swaps.\nForward contracts and commodity futures contracts are agreements to buy or sell a quantity of a currency or commodity at a predetermined future date, and at a predetermined\nrate or price. An option contract is an agreement that conveys the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a quantity of a currency or commodity at a\npredetermined rate or price during a period or at a time in the future. A collar is a strategy that uses a combination of options to limit the range of possible positive or negative\nreturns on an underlying asset or liability to a specific range, or to protect expected future cash flows. To do this, an investor simultaneously buys a put option and sells (writes)\na call option, or alternatively buys a call option and sells (writes) a put option. A swap agreement is a contract between two parties to exchange cash flows based on specified\nunderlying notional amounts, assets and/or indices. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. The Company may also designate certain non-\nderivative instruments, such as our foreign-denominated debt, in hedging relationships.\nAll derivatives are carried at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets, primarily in the following line items, as applicable: prepaid expenses and other assets; other assets;\naccounts payable and accrued expenses; and other liabilities. The carrying values of the derivatives reflect the impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash\ncollateral held or placed\n96\n\n\nwith the same counterparties, as applicable. These master netting agreements allow the Company to net settle positive and negative positions (assets and liabilities) arising from\ndifferent transactions with the same counterparty.\nThe accounting for gains and losses that result from changes in the fair values of derivative instruments depends on wh",

An insignificant amount of interest and penalties was recognized through\nincome tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2015. If the Company were to prevail on all uncertain tax positions, the reversal of this accrual would also be a benefit to\nthe Company's effective tax rate.\nIt is expected that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change in the next 12 months; however, we do not expect the change to have a significant impact on our\nconsolidated statement of income or consolidated balance sheet. These changes may be the result of settlements of ongoing audits, statute of limitations expiring or final\nsettlements in transfer pricing matters that are the subject of litigation. At this time, an estimate of the range of the reasonably possible outcomes cannot be made.\nThe one-time transition tax is based on our total accumulated post-1986 prescribed foreign earnings and profits (\"E&P\") estimated to be $42 billion, the majority of which was\npreviously considered to be indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, no U.S. federal and state income taxes were provided. We recorded a provisional tax amount of $4.6 billion\nas a reasonable estimate for our one-time transition tax liability and a $0.6 billion provisional deferred tax of related withholding taxes and state income taxes. Because of the\ncomplexities of the Tax Reform Act, we are still finalizing our calculation of the total accumulated post-1986 prescribed E&P for the applicable foreign entities. Further, the\ntransition tax is based in part on the amount of those earnings held in cash and other specified assets. This amount may change when we finalize the calculation of accumulated\npost-1986 prescribed foreign E&P and finalize the amounts held in cash or other specified assets. No additional income taxes have been provided for any additional outside\nbasis differences inherent in these entities, as these amounts continue to be provisionally indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Determining the amount of unrecognized\ndeferred tax liability related to any additional outside basis differences in these entities (i.e., basis differences in excess of that subject to the one-time transition tax) is not\npracticable. We also remeasured and adjusted certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates ",

In addition, we purchase sucralose, which we consider\na critical raw material, from a limited number of suppliers in the United States and China.

However, global demand for sucralose has increased in recent years as consumer products companies are reformulating food and beverages to replace high-intensity\nsweeteners with non-nutritive sweeteners, primarily sucralose.

In many\njurisdictions, compliance with competition laws is of special importance to us, and our operations may come under special scrutiny by competition law authorities due to our\ncompetitive position in those jurisdictions.\nIn the United States, the safety, production, transportation, distribution, advertising, labeling and sale of our Company's products and their ingredients are subject to the Federal\nFood, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; the Federal Trade Commission Act; the Lanham Act; state consumer protection laws; competition laws; federal, state and local workplace\nhealth and safety laws; various federal, state and local environmental protection laws; and various other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. Outside the United\nStates, our business is subject to numerous similar statutes and regulations, as well as other legal and regulatory requirements.\nUnder a California law known as Proposition 65, if the state has determined that a substance causes cancer or harms human reproduction, a warning must be provided for any\nproduct sold in the state that exposes consumers to that substance. The state maintains lists of these substances and periodically adds other substances to these lists. Proposition\n65 exposes all food and beverage producers to the possibility of having to",

Consequently, the detection of even a trace amount of\na listed substance can subject an affected product to the requirement of a warning label. However, Proposition 65 does not require a warning if the manufacturer of a product\ncan demonstrate that the use of that product exposes consumers to a daily quantity of a listed substance that is:\n• below a \"safe harbor\" threshold that may be\nestablished;\n• naturally\noccurring;\n• the result of necessary cooking;\nor\n• subject to another applicable\nexemption.\nOne or more substances that are currently on the Proposition 65 lists, or that may be added in the future, can be detected in certain Company products at low levels that are safe.\nWith respect to substances that have not yet been listed under Proposition 65, the Company takes the position that listing is not scientifically justified. With respect to\nsubstances that are already listed, the Company takes the position that the presence of each such substance in Company products is subject to an applicable exemption from the\nwarning requirement or that the product is otherwise in compliance with Proposition 65. The state of California and other parties, however, have in the past taken a contrary\nposition and may do so in the future.\nBottlers of our beverage products presently offer and use nonrefillable recyclable containers in the United States and various other markets around the world. Some of these\nbottlers also offer and use refillable containers, which are also recyclable. Legal requirements apply in various jurisdictions in the United States and overseas requiring that\ndeposits or certain ecotaxes or fees be charged in connection with the sale, marketing and use of certain beverage containers. The precise requirements imposed by these\nmeasures vary. Other types of statutes and regulations relating to beverage container deposits, recycling, ecotaxes and/or product stewardship also apply in various jurisdictions\nin the United States and overseas. We anticipate that additional such legal requirements may be proposed or enacted in the future at local, state and federal levels, both in the\nUnited States and elsewhere.\nAll of our Company's facilities and other operations in the United States and elsewhere around the world are subject to various environmental protection statutes and\nregulations, including those relating to the use of water resources and the discharge of wastewater. Our policy is to comply with all such legal requirements. Compliance with\nthese provisions has not had, and we do not expect such compliance to have, any material adverse effect on our Company's capital expenditures, net income or competitive\nposition.\nEmployees\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, our Company had approximately 61,800 and 100,300 e",

The final amounts may be\nsignificantly affected by regulations and interpretive guidance expected to be issued by the tax authorities, clarifications of the accounting treatment of various items, our\nadditional analysis, and our refinement of our estimates of the effects of the Tax Reform Act and, therefore, such final amounts may be materially different than our current\nprovisional amounts, which could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate.\nIncreased or new indirect taxes in the United States and throughout the world could negatively affect our business.\nOur business operations are subject to numerous duties or taxes that are not based on income, sometimes referred to as \"indirect taxes,\" including import duties, excise taxes,\nsales or value-added taxes, taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages, property taxes and payroll taxes, in many of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including indirect taxes\nimposed by state and local governments. In addition, in the past, the U.S. Congress considered imposing a federal excise tax on beverages sweetened with sugar, HFCS or other\nnutritive sweeteners and may consider similar proposals in the future. As federal, state and local governments in the United States and throughout the world experience\nsignificant budget deficits, some lawmakers have singled out beverages among a plethora of revenue-raising items and have imposed or increased, or proposed to impose or\nincrease, sales or similar taxes on beverages, particularly sugar-sweetened beverages. Increases in or the imposition of new indirect taxes on our business operations or products\nwould increase the cost of products or, to the extent levied directly on consumers, make our products less affordable, which may negatively impact our net operating revenues\nand profitability.\nIf we do not realize the economic benefits we anticipate from our productivity initiatives or are unable to successfully manage their possible negative consequences, our\nbusiness operations could be adversely affected.\nWe believe that improved productivity is essential to achieving our long-term growth objectives and, therefore, a leading priority of our Company is to design and implement\nthe most effective and efficient business model possible.

In particular, freezing weather or hurricanes in central Florida may result in shortages and higher prices for orange juice and orange\njuice concentrate throughout the industry. In addition, greening disease is reducing the number of citrus trees and increasing grower costs and prices.

We may also experience delays in extending our\nCompany's internal control over financial reporting to newly acquired or controlled bottling operations or other businesses, which may increase the risk of failure to prevent\nmisstatements in their financial records and in our consolidated financial statements. Our financial performance depends in large part on how well we can manage and improve\nthe performance of Company-owned or -controlled bottling operations and other acquired businesses or brands. We cannot assure you, however, that we will be able to achieve\nour strategic and financial objectives for such bottling operations or other acquisitions. If we are unable to achieve such objectives, our consolidated results could be negatively\naffected.\nIf we do not successfully manage our refranchising activities, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nAs part of our strategic initiative to refocus on our core business of building brands and leading our system of bottling partners, we have refranchised substantially all of our\nCompany-owned or -controlled bottling operations in the United States and all such bottling operations in China, and are continuing the process of refranchising Company-\nowned or -controlled bottling\n19\n\n\noperations in Canada and Africa",

In the Wisconsin Case, Aqua-Chem sought a declaratory judgment that the Company is responsible for all liabilities and expenses not\ncovered by insurance in connection with certain of Aqua-Chem's general and product liability claims arising from occurrences prior to the Company's sale of Aqua-Chem in\n1981, and a judgment for breach of contract in an amount exceeding $9 million for costs incurred by Aqua-Chem to date in connection with such claims. The Wisconsin Case\ninitially was stayed, pending final resolution of the Georgia Case, and later was voluntarily dismissed without prejudice by Aqua-Chem.\nThe Company owned Aqua-Chem from 1970 to 1981. During that time, the Company purchased over $400 million of insurance coverage, which also insures Aqua-Chem for\nsome of its prior and future costs for certain product liability and other claims. The Company sold Aqua-Chem to Lyonnaise American Holding, Inc., in 1981 under the terms of\na stock sale agreement. The 1981 agreement, and a subsequent 1983 settlement agreement, outlined the parties' rights and obligations concerning past and future claims and\nlawsuits involving Aqua-Chem. Cleaver-Brooks, a division of Aqua-Chem, manufactured boilers, some of which contained asbestos gaskets. Aqua-Chem was first named as a\ndefendant in asbestos lawsuits in or around 1985 and currently has approximately 40,000 active claims pending against it.\nThe parties agreed in 2004 to stay the Georgia Case pending the outcome of insurance coverage litigation filed by certain Aqua-Chem insurers on March 26, 2004. In the\ncoverage action, five plaintiff insurance companies filed suit (Century Indemnity Company, et al. v. Aqua-Chem, Inc., The Coca-Cola Company, et al., Case No. 04CV002852)\nin the Circuit Court, Civil Division of Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, against the Company, Aqua-Chem and 16 insurance companies. Several of the policies that were the\nsubject of the coverage action had been issued to the Company during the period (1970 to 1981) when the Company owned Aqua-Chem. The complaint sought a determination\nof the respective rights and obligations under the insurance policies issued with regard to asbestos-related claims against Aqua-Chem. The action also sought a monetary\njudgment reimbursing any amounts paid by the plaintiffs in excess of their obligations. Two of the insurers, one with a $15 million policy limit and one with a $25 million\npolicy limit, asserted cross-claims against the Company, alleging that the Company and/or its insurers are responsible for Aqua-Chem's asbestos liabilities before any obligation\nis triggered on the part of the cross-claimant insurers to pay for such costs under their policies.\nAqua-Chem and the Company filed and obtained a partial summary judgment determination in the coverage action that the insurers for Aqua-Chem and the Company were\njointly and severally liable for coverage amounts, but reserving judgment on ot",

During the course of the Wisconsin insurance coverage litigation,\nAqua-Chem and the Company reached settlements with several of the insurers, including plaintiffs, who paid funds into escrow accounts for payment of costs arising from the\nasbestos claims against Aqua-Chem. On July 24, 2007, the Wisconsin trial court entered a final declaratory judgment regarding the rights and obligations of the parties under\nthe insurance policies issued by the remaining defendant insurers, which judgment was not appealed. The judgment directs, among other things, that each insurer whose policy\nis triggered is jointly and severally liable for 100 percent of Aqua-Chem's losses up to policy limits. The court's judgment concluded the Wisconsin insurance coverage litigation.\nThe Company and Aqua-Chem continued to pursue and obtain coverage agreements for the asbestos-related claims against Aqua-Chem with those insurance companies that did\nnot settle in the Wisconsin insurance coverage litigation. The Company anticipated that a final settlement with three of those insurers (\"Chartis insurers\") would be finalized in\nMay 2011, but the Chartis insurers repudiated their settlement commitments and, as a result, Aqua-Chem and the Company filed suit against them\n21\n\n\nin Wisconsin state court to enforce the coverage-in-place settlement or, in the alternative, to obtain a declaratory judgment validating Aqua-Chem and the Company's\ninterpretation of the court's judgment in the Wisconsin insurance coverage litigation.\nIn February 2012, the parties filed and argued a number of cross-motions for summary judgment related to the issues of the enforceability of the settlement agreement and the\nexhaustion of policies underlying those of the Chartis insurers. The court granted defendants' motions for summary judgment that the 2011 Settlement Agreement and 2010\nTerm Sheet were not binding contracts, but denied their similar motions related to plaintiffs' claims for promissory and/or equitable estoppel. On or about May 15, 2012, the\nparties entered into a mutually agreeable settlement/stipulation resolving two major issues: exhaustion of underlying coverage and control of defense. On or about January 10,\n2013, the parties reached a settlement of the estoppel claims and all of the remaining coverage issues, with the exception of one disputed issue relating to the scope of the\nChartis insurers' defense obligations in two policy years. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the Company and Aqua-Chem on that one open issue and\nentered a final appealable judgment to that effect following the parties' settlement. On January 23, 2013, the Chartis insurers filed a notice of appeal of the trial court's summary\njudgment ruling.

In the\nNotice, the IRS claims that the Company's United States taxable income should be increased by an amount that creates a potential additional federal income tax liability of\napproximately $3.3 billion for the period, plus interest. No penalties were asserted in the Notice. The disputed amounts largely relate to a transfer pricing matter involving the\nappropriate amount of taxable income the Company should report in the United States in connection with its licensing of intangible property to certain related foreign licensees\nregarding the manufacturing, distribution, sale, marketing and promotion of products in overseas markets.\nDuring the 2007-2009 audit period, the Company followed the same transfer pricing methodology for these licenses that had consistently been followed since the methodology\nwas agreed with the IRS in a 1996 closing agreement that applied back to 1987. The closing agreement provided prospective penalty protection as long as the Company\nfollowed the prescribed methodology and material facts and circumstances and relevant federal tax law have not changed. On February 11, 2016, the IRS notified the Company,\nwithout further explanation, that the IRS had determined that material facts and circumstances and relevant federal tax law had changed permitting it to assert penalties. The\nCompany does not agree with this determination. The Company's compliance with the closing agreement was audited and confirmed by the IRS in five successive audit cycles\ncovering the subsequent 11 years through 2006, with the last audit concluding as recently as 2009.\nThe Notice represents a repudiation of the methodology previously adopted in the 1996 closing agreement. The IRS designated the matter for litigation on October 15, 2015. To\nthe extent the matter remains designated, the Company will be prevented from pursuing any administrative settlement at IRS Appeals or under the IRS Advance Pricing and\nMutual Agreement Program.\nThe Company firmly believes that the IRS' claims are without merit and plans to pursue all available administrative and judicial remedies necessary to resolve this matter. To\nthat end, the Company filed a petition in the U.S. Tax Court on December 14, 2015, and the IRS filed its answer on February 12, 2016. On October 4, 2017, the IRS filed an\namended answer to the Company's petition in which it increased its transfer pricing adjustment by $385 million resulting in an additional tax adjustment of $135 million.

Water is a limited natural resource facing\nunprecedented challenges from overexploitation, increased food demand, increasing pollution, poor management and the effects of climate change.\nOur Company regularly assesses the specific water-related risks that we and many of our bottling partners face and has implemented a formal water risk management program.\nMitigation of water risk forms the basis of our water stewardship strategic framework. This strategy is executed at the local level where we operate and includes the following\nelements: water use efficiency and wastewater treatment in manufacturing operations; shared watershed protection efforts; engaging local communities; and addressing water\nresource management in our agricultural ingredient supply chain. Such efforts are conducted in collaboration and partnership with others and are intended to help address local\nneeds. Many of these efforts help us in achieving our goal of replenishing the water that we and our bottling partners source and use in our finished products. We are also\ncollaborating with other companies, governments, nongovernmental organizations and communities to advocate for needed water policy reforms and action to protect water\navailability and quality around the world.\nThrough these integrated programs, we believe that our Company can leverage the water-related knowledge we have developed in the communities we serve — through source\nwater availability assessments and planning, water resource management, water treatment, wastewater treatment systems and models for working with communities and\npartners in addressing water and sanitation needs. As demand for water continues to increase around the world, we expect continued action on our part to help with the\nsuccessful long-term stewardship of this critical natural resource, both for our business and the communities we serve.\nEvolving Consumer Preferences\nWe are impacted by shifting consumer demographics and needs, on-the-go lifestyles, aging populations and consu",

This disproportionate relationship results in what is known as a variable interest,\nand the entity in which we have the variable interest is referred to as a \"VIE.\" An enterprise must consolidate a VIE if it is determined to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE.\nThe primary beneficiary has both (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance, and (2) the obligation to\nabsorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.\nOur Company holds interests in certain VIEs, primarily bottling and container manufacturing operations, for which we were not determined to be the primary beneficiary. Our\nvariable interests in these VIEs primarily relate to equity investments, profit guarantees or subordinated financial support. Refer to Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements.

For certain assets, recoverability and/or impairment tests are\nrequired only when conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. For other assets, impairment tests are required at least annually, or more frequently\nif events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired.\nOur equity method investees also perform such recoverability and/or impairment tests.

Factors that management must estimate include, among others,\nthe economic life of the asset, sales volume, pricing, cost of raw materials, delivery costs, inflation, cost of capital, marketing spending, foreign currency exchange rates, tax\nrates, capital spending and proceeds from the sale of assets.

Goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit or units that benefit from the synergies arising from each business combination.\nIn order to test for goodwill impairment, the Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value,\nincluding goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is lower than its carrying amount, goodwill is written down for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the\nfair value. However, the loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. We typically use discounted cash flow models to determine the fair value of a reporting\nunit. The assumptions used in these models are consistent with those we believe a hypot",

These charges included $390 million related to goodwill and $33\nmillion related to bottlers' franchise rights with indefinite lives. The impairment charges related to goodwill were determined by comparing the fair values of the reporting units,\nbased on Level 3 inputs, to their carrying values.

In addition, our Company and\nits subsidiaries have various pension plans and other forms of postretirement arrangements outside the United States.\nManagement is required to make certain critical estimates related to actuarial assumptions used to determine our pension expense and obligations. We believe the most critical\nassumptions are related to (1) the discount rate used to determine the present value of the liabilities and (2) the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. All of our\nactuarial assumptions are reviewed annually, or more frequently to the extent that a settlement or curtailment occurs. Changes in these assumptions could have a material impact\non the measurement of our pension expense and obligations.\n38\n\n\nAt each measurement date, we determine the discount rate primarily by reference to rates of high-quality, long-term corporate bonds that mature in a pattern similar to the future\npayments we anticipate making under the plans.

The Company believes the approach adopted in 2016\nprovides a more precise measurement of these components by improving the correlation between projected cash flows and the corresponding spot rates. The change does not\naffect the measurement of the Company's pension and other postretirement benefit obligations for those plans.

Our pension plan investment objective is to ensure all\nof our plans have sufficient funds to meet their benefit obligations when they become due. As a result, the Company periodically revises asset allocations, where appropriate, to\nimprove returns and manage risk. The weighted-average expected long-term rate of return used to calculate our pension expense was 8.00 percent and 8.25 percent in 2017 and\n2016, respectively.\nIn 2017, the Company's total pension expense related to defined benefit plans was $368 million, which included $28 million of net periodic benefit cost and $340 million of\nsettlement charges, curtailment charges and special termination benefit costs. In 2018, we expect our total pension expense to be approximately $17 million, which includes\n$108 million of net periodic benefit income and $125 million of estimated settlement charges and special termination benefit costs expected to be incurred. The decrease in 2018\nexpected net periodic benefit cost is primarily due to 2017 North America refranchising activities, which decreased the size of the active workforce and, therefore, the number of\nemployees earning pension benefits. Favorable asset performance in 2017 further decreased expected 2018 expense, although this was partially offset by a decrease in the\nweighted-average discount rate at December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016. The estimated impact of a 50 basis-point decrease in the discount rate on our 2018 net\nperiodic benefit cost would be an increase to our pension expense of $25 million.

For our Company, this generally means that we recognize revenue when title to our products is transferred to our bottling partners, resellers or other\ncustomers.

Refer to Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The aggregate deductions from revenue recorded by the Company in relation to these programs,\nincluding amortization expense on infrastructure programs, were $6.2 billion, $6.6 billion and $6.8 billion in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. In preparing the financial\nstatements, management must make estimates related to the contractual terms, customer performance and sales volume to determine the total amounts recorded as deductions\nfrom revenue. Management also considers past results in making such estimates. The actual amounts ultimately paid may be different from our estimates. Such differences are\nrecorded once they have been determined and have historically not been\n39\n\n\nsignificant.

The closing agreement provided prospective penalty protection as long as the Company\nfollowed the prescribed methodology and material facts and circumstances and relevant federal tax law have not changed. On February 11, 2016, the IRS notified the Company,\nwithout further explanation, that the IRS had determined that material facts and circumstances and relevant federal tax law had changed permitting it to assert penalties. The\nCompany does not agree with this determination. The Company's compliance with the closing agreement was audited and confirmed by the IRS in five successive audit cycles\ncovering the subsequent 11 years through 2006, with the last audit concluding as recently as 2009.\nThe Notice represents a repudiation of the methodology previously adopted in the 1996 closing agreement.

A\nvaluation allowance is required to be established unless management determines that it is more likely than not that the Company will ultimately realize the tax benefit\nassociated with a deferred tax asset. As of December 31, 2017, the Company's valuation allowances on deferred tax assets were $501 million and were primarily related to\nuncertainties regarding the future realization of recorded tax benefits on tax loss carryforwards generated in various jurisdictions.

If we were to identify and\nimplement tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or generate sufficient income of the appropriate character in these jurisdictions in the future, it could lead\nto the reversal of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense.

We recognize unit case volume for all sales of Company beverage products regardless of our\nownership interest in the bottling partner, if any. However, the unit case volume reported by our Bottling Investments operating segment is generally impacted by structural\nchanges because it only includes the unit case volume of our consolidated bottling operations. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional\ninformation on the Company's acquisitions and divestitures.\n\"Acquired brands\" refers to brands acquired during the past 12 months. Typically, the Company has not reported unit case volume or recognized concentrate sales volume\nrelated to acquired brands in periods prior to the closing of a transaction. Therefore, the unit case volume and concentrate sales volume from the sale of these brands is\nincremental to prior year volume. We do not generally consider acquired brands to be structural changes.\n\"Licensed brands\" refers to brands not owned by the Company, but for which we hold certain rights, generally including, but not limited to, distribution rights, and from which\nwe derive an economic benefit when these brands are ultimately sold. Typically, the Company has not reported unit case volume or recognized concentrate sales volume related\nto these brands in periods prior to the beginning of the term of a license agreement. Therefore, in the year that the licenses are entered into, the unit case volume and concentrate\nsales volume from the sale of these brands is incremental to prior year volume. We do not generally consider newly licensed brands to be structural changes.\nIn 2017, ABI's controlling interest in CCBA was transitioned to the Company, resulting in its consolidation.

As used in this report, \"unit case\" means\na unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings); and \"unit case volume\" means the number of unit cases (or unit case\nequivalents) of Company beverage products directly or indirectly sold by the Company and its bottling partners to customers. Unit case volume primarily consists of beverage\nproducts bearing Company trademarks. Also included in unit case volume are certain products licensed to, or distributed by, our Company, and brands owned by Coca-Cola\nsystem bottlers for which our Company provides marketing support and from the sale of which we derive economic benefit. In addition, unit case volume includes sales by\ncertain joint ventures in which the Company has an equity interest. We believe unit case volume is one of the measures of the underlying strength of the Coca-Cola system\nbecause it measures trends at the consumer level. The unit case volume numbers used in this report are derived based on estimates received by the Company from its bottling\npartners and distributors. Concentrate sales volume represents the amount of concentrates, syrups, beverage bases, source waters, and powders/minerals (in all instances\nexpressed in equivalent unit cases) sold by, or used in finished beverages sold by, the Company to its bottling partners or other customers. Unit case volume and concentrate\nsales volume growth rates are not necessarily equal during any given period.

We use debt financing to lower our\noverall cost of capital, which increases our return on shareowners' equity. This exposes us to adverse changes in interest rates. Our interest expense may also be affected by our\ncredit ratings.\nAs of December 31, 2017, our long-term debt was rated \"AA-\" by Standard & Poor's and \"Aa3\" by Moody's. Our commercial paper program was rated \"A-1+\" by Standard &\nPoor's and \"P-1\" by Moody's. In assessing our credit strength, both agencies consider our capital structure (including the amount and maturity dates of our debt) and financial\npolicies as well as the aggregated balance sheet and other financial information of the Company. In addition, some rating agencies also consider the financial information of\ncertain bottlers, including CCEP, Coca-Cola Amatil Limited, Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated, Coca-Cola FEMSA and Coca-Cola Hellenic. While the Company has no\nlegal obligation for the debt of these bottlers, the rating agencies believe the strategic importance of the bottlers to the Company's business model provides the Company with an\nincentive to keep these bottlers viable. It is our expectation that the credit rating agencies will continue using this methodology. If our credit ratings were to be downgraded as a\nresult of changes in our capital structure, our major bottlers' financial performance, changes in the credit rating agencies' methodology in assessing our credit strength, or for\nany other reason, our cost of borrowing could increase. Additionally, if certain bottlers' credit ratings were to decline, the Company's equity income could be reduced as a result\nof the potential increase in interest expense for those bottlers.\nWe monitor our financial ratios and, as indicated above, the rating agencies consider these ratios in assessing our credit ratings. Each rating agency employs a different\naggregation methodology and has different thresholds for the various financial ratios. These thresholds are not necessarily permanent, nor are they always fully disclosed to our\nCompany.\nOur global presence and strong capital position give us access to key financial markets around the world, enabling us to raise funds at a low effective cost. This posture, coupled\nwith active management of our mix of short-term and long-term debt and our mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt, results in a lower overall cost of borrowing. Our debt\nmanagement policies, in conjunction with our share repurchase program and investment activity, can result in current liabilities exceeding current assets.\nIssuances and payments of debt included both short-term and long-term financing activities.

The\ntotal currency impact on income from continuing operations before income taxes, including the effect of our hedging activities, was nominal in 2017 and was a decrease of 12\npercent in 2016.\nForeign currency exchange gains and losses are primarily the result of the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities from certain currencies into functional",

Refer to Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Foreign currency exchange gains and losses are included as a component of other income\n(loss) — net in our consolidated financial statements. Refer to the heading \"Operations Review — Other Income (Loss) — Net\" above. The Company recorded foreign currency\nexchange losses of $57 million in 2017, foreign currency exchange losses of $246 million in 2016 and foreign currency exchange gains of $149 million in 2015.\nHyperinflationary Economies\nA hyperinflationary economy is one that has cumulative inflation of 100 percent or more over a three-year period. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, local subsidiaries in\nhyperinflationary economies are required to use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency and remeasure the monetary assets and liabilities not denominated in U.S. dollars\nusing the rate applicable to conversion of a currency for purposes of dividend remittances. All exchange gains and losses resulting from remeasurement are recognized currently\nin income.\nVenezuela has been designated as a hyperinflationary economy. In February 2015, the Venezuelan government introduced a new open market exchange rate system, SIMADI.\nAs a result, we remeasured the net monetary assets of our Venezuelan subsidiary, resulting in a charge of $27 million recorded in the line item other income (loss) — net in our\nconsolidated statement of income.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, the Venezuelan government devalued its currency and changed its official and most preferential exchange rate, which should be\nused for purchases of certain essential goods, to 10 bolivars per U.S. dollar from 6.3. The official and most preferential rate is now known as DIPRO and the former official rate\nhas been eliminated. The Venezuelan government replaced the SIMADI rate with the DICOM rate, which is allowed to float freely and is expected to fluctuate based on supply\nand demand. As a result, management determined that the DICOM rate was the most appropriate legally available rate to remeasure the net monetary assets of our Venezuelan\nsubsidiary.\nIn addition, we sell concentrate to our bottling partner in Venezuela from outside the country. These sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. During the years ended December 31,\n2016 and December 31, 2015, as a result of the continued lack of liquidity and our revised assessment of the U.S. dollar value we expect to realize upon the conversion of\nVenezuelan bolivars into U.S. dollars by our bottling partner to pay our concentrate sales receivables, we recorded write-downs of $76 million and $56 million, respectively.\nThese write-downs were recorded in the line item other operating charges in our consolidated statements of income.\nWe also have certain U.S. dollar",

As a result of weaker sales, the volatility of foreign currency\nexchange rates resulting from continued instability and the Company's revised expectations regarding the convertibility of the local currency, we recognized impairment charges\nof $34 million and $55 million during the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2015, respectively. These charges were recorded in the line item other operating\ncharges in our consolidated statements of income. As a result of these impairment charges, the remaining carrying value of all U.S. dollar-denominated intangible assets\nassociated with products sold in Venezuela is zero.\nImpact of Inflation and Changing Prices\nInflation affects the way we operate in many markets around the world. In general, we believe that, over time, we will be able to increase prices to counteract the majority of the\ninflationary effects of increasing costs and to generate sufficient cash flows to maintain our productive capability.\n67\n\n\nOverview of Financial Position\nThe following table illustrates the change in the individual line items of the Company's consolidated balance sheet (in millions):\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\nIncrease\n(Decrease)\nPercent Change\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n6,006\n$\n8,555\n$\n(2,549)\n(30)%\nShort-term investments\n9,352\n9,595\n(243)\n(3)\nMarketable securities\n5,317\n4,051\n1,266\n31\nTrade accounts receivable — net\n3,667\n3,856\n(189)\n(5)\nInventories\n2,655\n2,675\n(20)\n(1)\nPrepaid expenses and other assets\n2,000\n2,481\n(481)\n(19)\nAssets held for sale\n219\n2,797\n(2,578)\n(92)\nAssets held for sale — discontinued operations\n7,329\n—\n7,329\n—\nEquity method investments\n20,856\n16,260\n4,596\n28\nOther investments\n1,096\n989\n107\n11\nOther assets\n4,560\n4,248\n312\n7\nProperty, plant and equipment — net\n8,203\n10,635\n(2,432)\n(23)\nTrademarks with indefinite lives\n6,729\n6,097\n632\n10\nBottlers' franchise rights with indefinite lives\n138\n3,676\n(3,538)\n(96)\nGoodwill\n9,401\n10,629\n(1,228)\n(12)\nOther intangible assets\n368\n726\n(358)\n(49)\nTotal assets\n$\n87,896\n$\n87,270\n$\n626\n1 %\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses\n$\n8,748\n$\n9,490\n$\n(742)\n(8)%\nLoans and notes payable\n13,205\n12,498\n707\n6\nCurrent maturities of long-term debt\n3,298\n3,527\n(229)\n(6)\nAccrued income taxes\n410\n307\n103\n34\nLiabilities held for sale\n37\n710\n(673)\n(95)\nLiabilities held for sale — discontinued operations\n1,496\n—\n1,496\n—\nLong-term debt\n31,182\n29,684\n1,498\n5\nOther liabilities\n8,021\n4,081\n3,940\n97\nDeferred income taxes\n2,522\n3,753\n(1,231)\n(33)\nTotal liabilities\n$\n68,919\n$\n64,050\n$\n4,869\n8 %\nNet assets\n$\n18,977\n$\n23,220\n$\n(4,243)\n1 \n(18)%\n1 Includes an increase in net assets of $861 million resulting from foreign currency translation adjustments in various balance sheet line\nitems.\nThe increases (decreases) in the table above include the impact of the following transactions and events:\n• Assets held for sale and liabilities held for sale decreased primarily due to the North America and Chi",

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nOur Company uses derivative financial instruments primarily to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, commodity prices\nand other market risks. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. As a matter of policy, all of our derivative positions are used to reduce risk by\nhedging an underlying economic exposure. Because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure, fluctuations in the value of the\ninstruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying exposure. The Company generally hedges anticipated exposures up to 36 months in\nadvance; however, the majority of our derivative instruments expire within 24 months or less. Virtually all of our derivatives are straightforward over-the-counter instruments\nwith liquid markets.\nWe monitor our exposure to financial market risks using several objective measurement systems, including a sensitivity analysis to measure our exposure to fluctuations in\nforeign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Refer to Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our\nhedging transactions and derivative financial instruments.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rates\nWe manage most of our foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis, which allows us to net certain exposures and take advantage of any natural offsets. In 2017, we\nused 74 functional currencies and generated $20,683 million of our net operating revenues from operations outside the United States; therefore, weaknesses in some currencies\nmight be offset by strengths in other currencies over time.

We use derivative financial instruments to further reduce our net exposure to foreign currency fluctuations.\nOur Company enters into forward exchange contracts and purchases foreign currency options (principally euros and Japanese yen) and collars to hedge certain portions of\nforecasted cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. Additionally, we enter into forward exchange contracts to offset the earnings impact related to foreign currency\nfluctuations on certain monetary assets and liabilities. We also enter into forward exchange contracts as hedges of net investments in foreign operations.\nThe total notional values of our foreign currency derivatives were $13,057 million and $14,464 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. These values include\nderivative instruments that are designated and qualify for hedge accounting as well as economic hedges. The fair value of the contracts that qualify for hedge accounting resulted\nin a net unrealized gain of $22 million as of December 31, 2017. At the end of 2017, we estimate that a 10 percent weakening of the U.S. dollar would have eliminated the net\nunrealized gain and created a net unrealized loss of $253 million. The fair value of the contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting resulted in a net unrealized loss of\n$50 million, and we estimate that a 10 percent weakening of the U.S. dollar would have increased the net unrealized loss to $105 million.\nInterest Rates\nThe Company is subject to interest rate volatility with regard to existing and future issuances of debt. We monitor our mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt as well as our mix\nof short-term debt and long-term debt. From time to time, we enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations.\nBased on the Company's variable-rate debt and derivative instruments outstanding as of December 31, 2017, we estimate that a 1 percentage point increase in interest rates\nwould have increased interest expense by $252 million in 2017. However, this increase in interest expense would have been partially offset by the increase in interest income\nrelated to higher interest rates.\nThe Company is subject to interest rate risk related to its investments in highly liquid securities. These investments are primarily managed by external managers within the\nguidelines of the Company's investment policy. Our policy requires these investments to be investment grade, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of\nprincipal loss. In addition, our policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. We estimate that a 1 percentage point increase in interest rates would result in a $97\nmillion decrease in the fair value of our portfolio of highly liquid securities.\nCommodity Prices\nThe Company is subject to market risk with respect to commodity price fluctuations, principally related to our purchases of sweeteners, metals, juices, PET and fuels.

We\nmanage our exposure to commodity risks primarily through the use of supplier pricing agreements that enable us to establish the purchase prices for certain inputs that are used\nin our manufacturing and distribution business. When deemed appropriate, we use derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to commodity risks. Certain of these\nderivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, but they are effective economic hedges that help the Company mitigate the price risk associated with the purchases of materials\nused in our manufacturing processes and the fuel used to operate our extensive vehicle fleet.\nOpen commodity derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting had notional values of $35 million and $12 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The fair\nvalue of the contracts that qualify for hedge accounting resulted in a net\n69\n\n\nunrealized loss of $5 million. The potential change in fair value of these commodity derivative instruments, assuming a 10 percent decrease in underlying commodity prices,\nwould have increased the net unrealized loss to $6 million.\nOpen commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting had notional values of $357 million and $447 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nThe fair value of the contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting resulted in a net unrealized gain of $20 million. The potential change in fair value of these commodity\nderivative instruments, assuming a 10 percent decrease in underlying commodity prices, would have eliminated the net unrealized gain and created a net unrealized loss of $18\nmillion.\n70\n\n\n \nITEM 8.

We own or license and market more than 500 nonalcoholic beverage brands, which we group into the\nfollowing category clusters: sparkling soft drinks; water, enhanced water and sports drinks; juice, dairy and plant-based beverages; tea and coffee; and energy drinks. We own\nand market four of the world's top five nonalcoholic sparkling soft drink brands: Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Fanta and Sprite. Finished beverage products bearing our trademarks,\nsold in the United States since 1886, are now sold in more than 200 countries.\nWe make our branded beverage products available to consumers throughout the world through our network of Company-owned or -controlled bottling and distribution\noperations, as well as independent bottling partners, distributors, wholesalers and retailers — the world's largest beverage distribution system. Beverages bearing trademarks\nowned by or licensed to us account for more than 1.9 billion of the approximately 60 billion servings of all beverages consumed worldwide every day.\nOur Company markets, manufactures and sells:\n• beverage concentrates, sometimes referred to as \"beverage bases,\" and syrups, including fountain syrups (we refer to this part of our business as our \"concentrate\nbusiness\" or \"concentrate operations\"); and\n• finished sparkling soft drinks and other nonalcoholic beverages (we refer to this part of our business as our \"finished product business\" or \"finished product\noperations\").\nGenerally, finished product operations generate higher net operating revenues but lower gross profit margins than concentrate operations.\nIn our concentrate operations, we typically generate net operating revenues by selling concentrates and syrups to authorized bottling operations (to which we typically refer as\nour \"bottlers\" or our \"bottling partners\"). Our bottling partners either combine the concentrates with sweeteners (depending on the product), still water and/or sparkling water, or\ncombine the syrups with sparkling water to produce finished beverages. The finished beverages are packaged in authorized containers — such as cans and refillable and\nnonrefillable glass and plastic bottles — bearing our trademarks or trademarks licensed to us  and are then sold to retailers directly or, in some cases, through wholesalers or\nother bottlers. Outside the United States, we also sell concentrates for fountain beverages to",

Our finished product operations generate net operating revenues by selling sparkling soft drinks and a variety of other nonalcoholic beverages, including\nwater, enhanced water and sports drinks; juice, dairy and plant-based beverages; tea and coffee; and energy drinks, to retailers or to distributors, wholesalers and bottling\npartners who distribute them to retailers. In addition, in the United States, we manufacture fountain syrups and sell them to fountain retailers, such as restaurants and\nconvenience stores who use the fountain syrups to produce beverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners who resell the\nfountain syrups to fountain retailers. These fountain syrup sales are included in our North America operating segment. We authorize these wholesalers to resell our fountain\nsyrups through nonexclusive appointments that neither restrict us in setting the prices at which we sell fountain syrups to the wholesalers nor restrict the territories in which the\nwholesalers may resell in the United States.\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"U.S. GAAP\"). The\npreparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses\nand the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Although these estimates are based on our knowledge of\ncurrent events and actions we may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately differ from\n77\n\n\nthese estimates and assumptions. Furthermore, when testing assets for impairment in future periods, if management uses different assumptions or if different conditions occur,\nimpairment charges may result.\nCertain amounts in the prior years' consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been revised to conform to the current year presentation.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nOur Company consolidates all entities that we control by ownership of a majority voting interest. Additionally, there are situations in which consolidation is required even\nthough the usual condition of consolidation (ownership of a majority voting interest) does not apply. Gener",

Generally, this occurs when an entity holds an interest in another business\nenterprise that was achieved through arrangements that do not involve voting interests, which results in a disproportionate relationship between such entity's voting interests in,\nand its exposure to the economic risks and potential rewards of, the other business enterprise. This disproportionate relationship results in what is known as a variable interest,\nand the entity in which we have the variable interest is referred to as a \"VIE.\" An enterprise must consolidate a VIE if it is determined to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE.\nThe primary beneficiary has both (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance, and (2) the obligation to\nabsorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.\nOur Company holds interests in certain VIEs, primarily bottling and container manufacturing operations, for which we were not determined to be the primary beneficiary. Our\nvariable interests in these VIEs primarily relate to equity investments, profit guarantees or subordinated financial support. Refer to Note 11. Although these financial\narrangements resulted in our holding variable interests in these entities, they did not empower us to direct the activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact the VIEs'\neconomic performance. Our Company's investments, plus any loans and guarantees, and other subordinated financial support related to these VIEs totaled $4,523 million and\n$3,709 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, representing our maximum exposures to loss. The Company's investments, plus any loans and guarantees,\nrelated to these VIEs were not individually significant to the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn addition, our Company holds interests in certain VIEs, primarily bottling and container manufacturing operations, for which we were determined to be the primary\nbeneficiary. As a result, we have consolidated these entities. Our Company's investments, plus any loans and guarantees, related to these VIEs totaled $1 million and $203\nmillion as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, representing our maximum exposures to loss. The assets and liabilities of VIEs for which we are the primary\nbeneficiary were not significant to the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nCreditors of our VIEs do not have recourse against the general credit of the Company, regardless of whether they are accounted for as consolidated entities.\nWe use the equity method to account for investments in companies if our investment provides us with the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial\npolicies of the investee.

Any loss resulting\nfrom this measurement is recognized in the period in which the held-for-sale criteria are met.

Alternatively, if a business meets the criteria for held for sale on the acquisition date, the business is accounted for as a discontinued operation. In October 2017, the\nCompany and Anheuser-Busch InBev (\"ABI\") completed the transition of ABI's controlling interest in Coca-Cola Beverages Africa Proprietary Limited (\"CCBA\") to the\nCompany for $3,150 million, resulting in its consolidation. As CCBA met the criteria for held for sale upon consolidation, we have presented the financial position and results\nof operations of CCBA as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery of products has occurred, the sales price charged is fixed or determinable, and\ncollectibility is reasonably assured. For our Company, this generally means that we recognize revenue when title to our products is transferred to our bottling partners, resellers\nor other customers. In particular, title usually transfers upon shipment to or receipt at our customers' locations, as determined by the specific sales terms of the transactions. Our\nsales terms do not allow for a right of return except for matters related to any manufacturing defects on our part.\nDeductions from Revenue\nOur customers can earn certain incentives including, but not limited to, cash discounts, funds for promotional and marketing activities, volume-based incentive programs and\nsupport for infrastructure programs. The costs associated with these incentives are included in deductions from revenue, a component of net operating revenues in our\nconsolidated statements of income. For customer incentives that must be earned, management must make estimates related to the contractual terms, customer performance and\nsales volume to determine the total amounts earned and to be recorded in deductions from revenue. In making these estimates, management considers past results. The actual\namounts ultimately paid may be different from our estimates.\nIn some situations, the Company may determine it to be advantageous to make advance payments to specific customers to fund certain marketing activities intended to generate\nprofitable volume and/or invest in infrastructure programs with our bottlers that are directed at strengthening our bottling system and increasing unit case volume. The Company\nalso makes advance payments to certain customers for distribution rights.

We use\nthe proportion of each interim period's actual unit case volume to the estimated full year unit case volume as the basis for the allocation. This methodology results in our\nmarketing expenditures being recognized at a standard rate per unit case.

We determine the useful lives of our identifiable intangible assets after considering the specific facts and circumstances related to each intangible\nasset.

If the Company concludes that this is the case, it must perform the testing described above. Otherwise, the Company does not need to perform any\nfurther assessment.\nWe perform impairment tests of goodwill at our reporting unit level, which is one level below our operating segments. Our operating segments are primarily based on\ngeographic responsibility, which is consistent with the way management runs our business.

Generally, each Company-owned or consolidated bottling operation within our Bottling Investments\noperating segment is its own reporting unit. Goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit or units that benefit from the synergies arising from each business combination.\nIn order to test for goodwill impairment, the Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value,\nincluding goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is lower than its carrying amount, goodwill is written down for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the\nfair value. However, the loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. We typically use discounted cash flow models to determine the fair value of a reporting\nunit.

The fair\nvalue of our stock option grants is estimated on the grant date using a Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. The Company recognizes compensation expense on a\nstraight-line basis over the period the grant is earned by the employee, generally four years.\nThe fair value of our restricted stock units, restricted stock and certain performance share units is the quoted market value of the Company's stock on the grant date less the\npresent value of the expected dividends not received during the relevant period. For most performance share units granted beginning in 2014, the Company includes a relative\ntotal shareowner return (\"TSR\") modifier to determine the number of shares earned at the end of the performance period. For these awards, the number of shares earned based\non the certified achievement of the predefined performance criteria will be reduced or increased if the Company's total shareowner return over the performance period relative to\na predefined compensation comparator group of companies falls outside of a defined range. The fair value of performance share units that include the TSR modifier is\ndetermined using a Monte Carlo valuation model.\nIn the period it becomes probable that the minimum performance criteria specified in the performance share award will be achieved, we recognize expense for the proportionate\nshare of the total fair value of the award related to the vesting period that has already lapsed. The remaining fair value of the award is expensed on a straight-line basis over the\nbalance of the vesting period. In the event the Company determines it is no longer probable that we will achieve the minimum performance criteria specified in the award, we\nreverse all of the previously recognized compensation expense in the period such a determination is made. The Company has made a policy election to estimate the number of\nawards that are expected to vest to determine the amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized in earnings.

The Company also evaluated the principal versus agent considerations as it relates to certain of its arrangements with third-party manufacturers and co-\npackers. We concluded that certain costs from these arrangements will be reflected in net operating revenues rather than in cost of goods sold.

In conjunction with the Southwest Transaction, Arca contributed its existing beverage business to AC\nBebidas. CCR contributed its Southwest operating unit, including all of its assets and liabilities, to AC Bebidas in exchange for an approximate 20 percent interest in AC\nBebidas. Arca owns the remaining interest in AC Bebidas. Additionally, CCR made cash payments of $144 million, net of cash received. As a result of the Southwest\nTransaction, the Company recognized a gain of $1,037 million due to the difference in the recorded carrying value of the net assets transferred compared to the value of the\ninterest it obtained in AC Bebidas of $2,960 million, which was determined using an income and market approach (a Level 3 measurement). This gain was recorded in the line\nitem other income (loss) — net in our consolidated statement of income. AC Bebidas will participate in the NPSS as it relates to its U.S. territory.

These changes in market conditions may adversely impact the Company's financial\nperformance and are referred to as \"market risks.\" When deemed appropriate, our Company uses derivatives as a risk management tool to mitigate the potential impact of\ncertain market risks. The primary market risks managed by the Company through the use of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments are foreign currency exchange\nrate risk, commodity price risk and interest rate risk.\nThe Company uses various types of derivative instruments including, but not limited to, forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, option contracts, collars and swaps.\nForward contracts and commodity futures contracts are agreements to buy or sell a quantity of a currency or commodity at a predetermined future date, and at a predetermined\nrate or price. An option contract is an agreement that conveys the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a quantity of a currency or commodity at a\npredetermined rate or price during a period or at a time in the future. A collar is a strategy that uses a combination of options to limit the range of possible positive or negative\nreturns on an underlying asset or liability to a specific range, or to protect expected future cash flows. To do this, an investor simultaneously buys a put option and sells (writes)\na call option, or alternatively buys a call option and sells (writes) a put option. A swap agreement is a contract between two parties to exchange cash flows based on specified\nunderlying notional amounts, assets and/or indices. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. The Company may also designate certain non-\nderivative instruments, such as our foreign-denominated debt, in hedging relationships.\nAll derivatives are carried at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets, primarily in the following line items, as applicable: prepaid expenses and other assets; other assets;\naccounts payable and accrued expenses; and other liabilities. The carrying values of the derivatives reflect the impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash\ncollateral held or placed\n96\n\n\nwith the same counterparties, as applicable. These master netting agreements allow the Company to net settle positive and negative positions (assets and liabilities) arising from\ndifferent transactions with the same counterparty.\nThe accounting for gains and losses that result from changes in the fair values of derivative instruments depends on wh",

Derivatives can be designated as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign\noperations. The changes in the fair values of derivatives that have been designated and qualify for fair value hedge accounting are recorded in the same line item in our\nconsolidated statement of income as the changes in the fair values of the hedged items attributable to the risk being hedged. The changes in the fair values of derivatives that\nhave been designated and qualify as cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign operations are recorded in AOCI and are reclassified into the line item in our\nconsolidated statement of income in which the hedged items are recorded in the same period the hedged items affect earnings. Due to the high degree of effectiveness between\nthe hedging instruments and the underlying exposures being hedged, fluctuations in the value of the derivative instruments are generally offset by changes in the fair values or\ncash flows of the underlying exposures being hedged. The changes in the fair values of derivatives that were not designated and/or did not qualify as hedging instruments are\nimmediately recognized into earnings.\nFor derivatives that will be accounted for as hedging instruments, the Company formally designates and documents, at inception, the financial instrument as a hedge of a\nspecific underlying exposure, the risk management objective and the strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction. In addition, the Company formally assesses, both at the\ninception and at least quarterly thereafter, whether the financial instruments used in hedging transactions are effective at offsetting changes in either the fair values or cash flows\nof the related underlying exposures. Any ineffective portion of a financial instrument's change in fair value is immediately recognized into earnings.\nThe Company determines the fair values of its derivatives based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current market rates. Refer to Note 16. The notional amounts\nof the derivative financial instruments do not necessarily represent amounts exchanged by the parties and, therefore, are not a direct measure of our exposure to the financial\nrisks described above. The amounts exchanged are calculated by reference to the notional amounts and by other terms of the derivatives, such as interest rates, foreign currency\nexchange rates, commodity rates or other financial indices. The Company does not view the fair values of its derivatives in isolation but rather in relation to the fair values or\ncash flows of the underlying hedged transactions or other exposures.

Refer to Note 16 for the net presentation of the Company's derivative instruments.\n2 Refer to Note 16 for additional information related to the estimated fair\nvalue.\nCredit Risk Associated with Derivatives\nWe have established strict counterparty credit guidelines and enter into transactions only with financial institutions of investment grade or better. We monitor counterparty\nexposures regularly and review any downgrade in credit rating immediately. If a downgrade in the credit rating of a counterparty were to occur, we have provisions requiring\ncollateral for substantially all of our transactions. To mitigate presettlement risk, minimum credit standards become more stringent as the duration of the derivative financial\ninstrument increases. In addition, the Company's master netting agreements reduce credit risk by permitting the Company to net settle for transactions with the same\ncounterparty. To minimize the concentration of credit risk, we enter into derivative transactions with a portfolio of financial institutions. Based on these factors, we consider the\nrisk of counterparty default to be minimal.\nCash Flow Hedging Strategy\nThe Company uses cash flow hedges to minimize the variability in cash flows of assets or liabilities or forecasted transactions caused by fluctuations in foreign currency\nexchange rates, commodity prices or interest rates. The changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in AOCI and are reclassified into the\nline item in our consolidated statement of income in which the hedged items are recorded in the same period the hedged items affect earnings. The changes in fair values of\nhedges that are determined to be ineffective are immediately reclassified from AOCI into earnings. The maximum length of time for which the Company hedges its exposure to\nthe variability in future cash flows is typically three years.\nThe Company maintains a foreign currency cash flow hedging program to reduce the risk that our eventual U.S. dollar net cash inflows from sales outside the United States and\nU.S. dollar net cash outflows from procurement activities will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We enter into forward contracts and\npurchase foreign currency options (principally euros and Japanese yen) and collars to hedge certain portions of forecasted cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. When\nthe U.S. dollar strengthens against the foreign currencies, the decline in the present value of future foreign currency cash flows is partially offset by gains in the fair value of the\nderivative instruments. Conversely, when the U.S. dollar weakens, the increase in the present value of future foreign currency cash flows is partially offset by losses in the fair\nvalue of\n98\n\n\nthe derivative instruments.

Refer to Note 14.\nOn September 17, 2015, the Company received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (\"Notice\") from the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") for the tax years 2007 through 2009,\nafter a five-year audit. In the Notice, the IRS claims that the Company's United States taxable income should be increased by an amount that creates a potential additional\nfederal income tax liability of approximately $3.3 billion for the period, plus interest. No penalties were asserted in the Notice. The disputed amounts largely relate to a transfer\npricing matter involving the appropriate amount of taxable income the Company should report in the United States in connection with its licensing of intangible property to\ncertain related foreign licensees regarding the manufacturing, distribution, sale, marketing and promotion of products in overseas markets.\nDuring the 2007-2009 audit period, the Company followed the same transfer pricing methodology for these licenses that had consistently been followed since the methodology\nwas agreed with the IRS in a 1996 closing agreement that applied back to 1987. The closing agreement provided prospective penalty protection as long as the Company\nfollowed the prescribed methodology and material facts and circumstances and relevant federal tax law have not changed. On February 11, 2016, the IRS notified the Company,\nwithout further explanation, that the IRS had determined that material facts and circumstances and relevant federal tax law had changed permitting it to assert penalties. The\nCompany does not agree with this determination. The Company's compliance with the closing agreement was audited and confirmed by the IRS in five successive audit cycles\ncovering the subsequent 11 years through 2006, with the last audit concluding as recently as 2009.\nThe Notice represents a repudiation of the methodology previously adopted in the 1996 closing agreement. The IRS designated the matter for litigation on October 15, 2015. To\nthe extent the matter remains designated, the Company will be prevented from pursuing any administrative settlement at IRS Appeals or under the IRS Advance Pricing and\nMutual Agreement Program.\nThe Company firmly believes that the IRS' claims are without merit and plans to pursue all available administrative and judicial remedies necessary to resolve this matter. To\nthat end, the Company filed a petition in the U.S. Tax Court on\n110\n\n\nDecember 14, 2015, and the IRS filed its answer on February 12, 2016. On October 4, 2017, the IRS filed an amended answer to the Company's petition in which it increased its\ntransfer pricing adjustment by $385 million resulting in an additional tax adjustment of $135 million. A trial date has been set for March 5, 2018. The Company intends to\nvigorously defend its position and is confident in its ability to prevail on the merits.\nOn June 20, 2017, the",

On December 14, 2017, the U.S.\nTax Court issued a decision on the summary judgment motion in favor of the Company. This decision effectively reduced the IRS' potential tax adjustment by approximately\n$138 million.\nThe Company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from examinations such as this to determine the adequacy of its tax reserves. The Company\nbelieves that the final adjudication of this matter will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, the ultimate\noutcome of disputes of this nature is uncertain, and if the IRS were to prevail in any material respect on its assertions, the additional tax, interest and any potential penalties\ncould have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisk Management Programs\nThe Company has numerous global insurance programs in place to help protect the Company from the risk of loss. In general, we are self-insured for large portions of many\ndifferent types of claims; however, we do use commercial insurance above our self-insured retentions to reduce the Company's risk of catastrophic loss. Our reserves for the\nCompany's self-insured losses are estimated using actuarial methods and assumptions of the insurance industry, adjusted for our specific expectations based on our claim\nhistory. Our self-insurance reserves totaled $480 million and $527 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nWorkforce (Unaudited)\nWe refer to our employees as \"associates.\" As of December 31, 2017, our Company had approximately 61,800 associates, of which approximately 12,400 associates were\nlocated in the United States. Our Company, through its divisions and subsidiaries, is a party to numerous collective bargaining agreements. As of December 31, 2017,\napproximately 3,700 associates, excluding seasonal hires, in North America were covered by collective bargaining agreements. These agreements typically have terms of three\nyears to five years years. We currently expect that we will be able to renegotiate such agreements on satisfactory terms when they expire. The Company believes that its\nrelations with its associates are generally satisfactory.\nOperating Leases\nThe following table summarizes our minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases with initial or remaining lease terms in excess of one year as of\nDecember 31, 2017 (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\nOperating Lease\nPayments\n2018\n$\n130\n2019\n85\n2020\n69\n2021\n59\n2022\n52\nThereafter\n147\nTotal minimum operating lease payments1\n$\n542\n1 Income associated with sublease arrangements is not\nsignificant.\n \nNOTE 12: STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS\nOur Company grants awards under its stock-based compensation plans to certain employees of the Company.

Beginning in\n2015, the 2014 Equity Plan was the primary plan in use for equity awards and performance cash awards. There were no grants made from the 2014 Equity Plan prior to 2015.

Economic profit and net operating revenues are adjusted for certain items, which are approved and certified by the Audit Committee of the Board of\nDirectors. The purpose of these adjustments is to ensure a consistent year-to-year comparison of the specific performance criteria. In the event the certified results equal the\npredefined performance criteria, the Company will grant the number of shares equal to the target award. In the event the certified results exceed the predefined performance\ncriteria, additional shares up to the maximum award will be granted. In the event the certified results fall below the predefined performance criteria, a reduced number of shares\nwill be granted. If the certified results fall below the threshold award performance level, no shares will be granted. The performance share units granted under this program are\nthen generally subject to a holding period of one year before the shares are released.\nPerformance share units generally do not entitle participants to vote or receive dividends. For most performance share units granted beginning in 2014, the Company includes a\nrelative TSR modifier to determine the number of shares earned at the end of the performance period. For these awards, the number of shares earned based on the certified\nachievement of the predefined performance criteria will be reduced or increased if the Company's total shareowner return over the performance period relative to a predefined\ncompensation comparator group of companies falls outside of a defined range. The fair value of performance share units that include the TSR modifier is determined using a\nMonte Carlo valuation model. For the remaining awards that do not include the TSR modifier, the fair value of the performance share units is the quoted market value of the\nCompany's stock on the grant date less the present value of the expected dividends not received during the relevant period.\nIn the period it becomes probable that the minimum performance criteria specified in the award will be achieved, we recognize expense for the proportionate share of the total\nfair value of the performance share units related to the vesting period that has already lapsed for the shares expected to vest and be released. The remaining fair value of the\nshares expected to vest and be released is expensed on a straight-line basis over the balance of the vesting period.

We have established asset allocation targets and investment\nguidelines with each investment manager. Our asset allocation targets promote optimal expected return and volatility characteristics given the long-term time horizon for\nfulfilling the obligations of\n116\n\n\nthe plans. Selection of the targeted asset allocation for U.S. plan assets was based upon a review of the expected return and risk characteristics of each asset class, as well as the\ncorrelation of returns among asset classes. Our target allocation is a mix of 42 percent equity investments, 30 percent fixed-income investments and 28 percent alternative\ninvestments. We believe this target allocation will enable us to achieve the following long-term investment objectives:\n(1) optimize the long-term return on plan assets at an acceptable level of\nrisk;\n(2) maintain a broad diversification across asset classes and among investment managers;\nand\n(3) maintain careful control of the risk level within each asset\nclass.\nThe guidelines that have been established with each investment manager provide parameters within which the investment managers agree to operate, including criteria that\ndetermine eligible and ineligible securities, diversification requirements and credit quality standards, where applicable. Unless exceptions have been approved, investment\nmanagers are prohibited from buying or selling commodities, futures or option contracts, as well as from short selling of securities. Additionally, investment managers agree to\nobtain written approval for deviations from stated investment style or guidelines. As of December 31, 2017, no investment manager was responsible for more than 9 percent of\ntotal U.S. plan assets.\nOur target allocation of 42 percent equity investments is composed of 60 percent global equities, 16 percent emerging market equities and 24 percent domestic small- and mid-\ncap equities. Optimal returns through our investments in global equities are achieved through security selection as well as country and sector diversification. Investments in the\ncommon stock of our Company accounted for approximately 4 percent of our total global equities and approximately 2 percent of total U.S. plan assets. Our investments in\nglobal equities are intended to provide diversified exposure to both U.S. and non-U.S. equity markets. Our investments in both emerging market equities and domestic small-\nand mid-cap equities may experience large swings in their market value. Our investments in these asset classes are selected based on capital appreciation potential.\nOur target allocation of 30 percent fixed-income investments is composed of 33 percent long-duration bonds and 67 percent wi",

Our investments in long-duration bonds\nare diversified in order to mitigate duration and credit exposure. Multi-strategy alternative credit managers invest in a combination of high-yield bonds, bank loans, structured\ncredit and emerging market debt. These investments are in lower-rated and non-rated debt securities, which generally produce higher returns compared to long-duration bonds\nand also help to diversify our overall fixed-income portfolio.\nIn addition to equity investments and fixed-income investments, we have a target allocation of 28 percent in alternative investments. These alternative investments include\nhedge funds, reinsurance, private equity limited partnerships, leveraged buyout funds, international venture capital partnerships and real estate. The objective of investing in\nalternative investments is to provide a higher rate of return than that available from publicly traded equity securities. These investments are inherently illiquid and require a\nlong-term perspective in evaluating investment performance.\nInvestment Strategy for Non-U.S. Pension Plans\nAs of December 31, 2017, the long-term target allocation for 73 percent of our international subsidiaries' pension plan assets, primarily certain of our European and Canadian\nplans, is 71 percent equity securities, 10 percent fixed-income securities and 19 percent other investments. The actual allocation for the remaining 27 percent of the Company's\ninternational subsidiaries' plan assets consisted of 55 percent mutual, pooled and commingled funds; 5 percent fixed-income securities; and 40 percent other investments. The\ninvestment strategies for our international subsidiaries' plans differ greatly, and in some instances are influenced by local law. None of our pension plans outside the United\nStates is individually significant for separate disclosure.\nOther Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets\nPlan assets associated with other postretirement benefits primarily represent funding of one of the U.S. postretirement benefit plans through a Voluntary Employee Beneficiary\nAssociation (\"VEBA\"), a tax-qualified trust.

For other non-U.S. plans, we base the discount rate on comparable\nindices within each of the countries. The rate of compensation increase assumption is determined by the Company based upon annual reviews. We review external data and our\nown historical trends for health care costs to determine the health care cost trend rate assumptions.\nEffective January 1, 2016, for benefit plans using the yield curve approach, the Company changed the method used to calculate the service cost and interest cost components of\nnet periodic benefit cost for pension and other postretirement benefit plans and is measuring these components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the\nplans' projected cash flows. The Company believes the new approach provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between\nprojected cash flows and the corresponding spot rates.

The Company had $177 million, $142 million and $111\nmillion in interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits accrued as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Of these amounts, $35 million and $31\nmillion of expense were recognized through income tax expense in 2017 and 2016, respectively. An insignificant amount of interest and penalties was recognized through\nincome tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2015. If the Company were to prevail on all uncertain tax positions, the reversal of this accrual would also be a benefit to\nthe Company's effective tax rate.\nIt is expected that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change in the next 12 months; however, we do not expect the change to have a significant impact on our\nconsolidated statement of income or consolidated balance sheet. These changes may be the result of settlements of ongoing audits, statute of limitations expiring or final\nsettlements in transfer pricing matters that are the subject of litigation. At this time, an estimate of the range of the reasonably possible outcomes cannot be made.\nThe one-time transition tax is based on our total accumulated post-1986 prescribed foreign earnings and profits (\"E&P\") estimated to be $42 billion, the majority of which was\npreviously considered to be indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, no U.S. federal and state income taxes were provided. We recorded a provisional tax amount of $4.6 billion\nas a reasonable estimate for our one-time transition tax liability and a $0.6 billion provisional deferred tax of related withholding taxes and state income taxes. Because of the\ncomplexities of the Tax Reform Act, we are still finalizing our calculation of the total accumulated post-1986 prescribed E&P for the applicable foreign entities. Further, the\ntransition tax is based in part on the amount of those earnings held in cash and other specified assets. This amount may change when we finalize the calculation of accumulated\npost-1986 prescribed foreign E&P and finalize the amounts held in cash or other specified assets. No additional income taxes have been provided for any additional outside\nbasis differences inherent in these entities, as these amounts continue to be provisionally indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Determining the amount of unrecognized\ndeferred tax liability related to any additional outside basis differences in these entities (i.e., basis differences in excess of that subject to the one-time transition tax) is not\npracticable.

This includes certain\npricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs.\nRecurring Fair Value Measurements\nIn accordance with U.S. GAAP, certain assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. For our Company, the only assets and liabilities that\nare adjusted to fair value on a recurring basis are investments in equity and debt securities classified as trading or available-for-sale and derivative financial instruments.\nAdditionally, the Company adjusts the carrying value of certain long-term debt as a result of the Company's fair value hedging strategy.\nInvestments in Trading and Available-for-Sale Securities\nThe fair values of our investments in trading and available-for-sale securities using quoted market prices from daily exchange traded markets are based on the closing price as of\nthe balance sheet date and are classified as Level 1. The fair values of our investments in trading and available-for-sale securities classified as Level 2 are priced using quoted\nmarket prices for similar instruments or nonbinding market prices that are corroborated by observable market data. Inputs into these valuation techniques include actual trade\ndata, benchmark yields, broker/dealer quotes and other similar data. These inputs are obtained from quoted market prices, independent pricing vendors or other sources.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe fair values of our futures contracts are primarily determined using quoted contract prices on futures exchange markets. The fair values of these instruments are based on the\nclosing contract price as of the balance sheet date and are classified as Level 1.\nThe fair values of our derivative instruments other than futures are determined using standard valuation models.

This program is focused on the following initiatives: global supply chain optimization; global marketing and innovation effectiveness;\noperating expense leverage and operational excellence; data and information technology systems standardization; and the integration of Old CCE's North American bottling\noperations.\nIn February 2014, the Company announced the expansion of our productivity and reinvestment program to drive incremental productivity that will primarily be redirected into\nincreased media investments. Our incremental productivity goal consists of two relatively equal components. First, we will expand savings through global supply chain\noptimization, data and information technology systems standardization, and resource and cost reallocation. Second, we will increase the effectiveness of our marketing\ninvestments by transforming our marketing and commercial model to redeploy resources into more consumer-facing marketing investments to accelerate growth.\nIn October 2014, the Company announced that we were further expanding our productivity and reinvestment program and extending it through 2019. The expansion of the\nproductivity initiatives will focus on four key areas: restructuring the Company's global supply chain; implementing zero-based work, an evolution of zero-based budget\nprinciples, across the organization; streamlining and simplifying the Company's operating model; and further driving increased discipline and efficiency in direct marketing\ninvestments.\nIn April 2017, the Company announced its plans to transition to a new, more agile operating model to enable growth. Under this operating model, our business units will be\nsupported by an expanded enabling services organization and a corporate center focused on a few strategic initiatives, policy and governance. The expanded enabling services\norganization will focus on both simplifying and standardizing key transactional processes and providing support to business units through global centers of excellence.\nThe Company has incurred total pretax expenses of $3,058 million related to this program since it commenced.

In addition, we purchase sucralose, which we consider\na critical raw material, from a limited number of suppliers in the United States and China. We work closely with our primary sucralose suppliers to maintain continuity of\nsupply. However, global demand for sucralose has increased in recent years as consumer products companies are reformulating food and beverages to replace high-intensity\nsweeteners with non-nutritive sweeteners, primarily sucralose. In addition, the Chinese sucralose industry has been impacted by the imposition of stringent environmental\nrequirements that have reduced or closed production.

Increasing public concern\nabout obesity; other health-related public concerns surrounding consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages; possible new or increased taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages by\ngovernment entities to reduce consumption or to raise revenue; additional governmental regulations concerning the marketing, labeling, packaging or sale of our sugar-\nsweetened beverages; and negative publicity resulting from actual or threatened legal actions against us or other companies in our industry relating to the marketing, labeling or\nsale of sugar-sweetened beverages may reduce demand for, or increase the cost of, our sugar-sweetened beverages, which could adversely affect our profitability.\nWater scarcity and poor quality could negatively impact the Coca-Cola system's costs and capacity.\nWater is a main ingredient in substantially all of our products, is vital to the production of the agricultural ingredients on which our business relies and is needed in our\nmanufacturing process. It also is critical to the prosperity of the communities we serve. Water is a limited resource in many parts of the world, facing unprecedented challenges\nfrom overexploitation, increasing demand for food and other consumer and industrial products whose manufacturing processes require water, increasing pollution, poor\nmanagement and the effects of climate change. As the demand for water continues to increase around the world, and as water becomes scarcer and the quality of available water\ndeteriorates, the Coca-Cola system may incur higher costs or face capacity constraints that could adversely affect our profitability or net operating revenues in the long run.\nIf we do not address evolving consumer preferences, our business could suffer.\nConsumer preferences have evolved and continue to evolve as a result of, among other things, health, wellness and nutrition considerations, especially the perceived\nundesirability of artificial ingredients and obesity concerns; shifting consumer demographics, including aging populations; changes in consumer tastes and needs; changes in\nconsumer lifestyles; location of origin or source of products and ingredients; and competitive product and pricing pressures. If we fail to address these changes, or do not\nsuccessfully anticipate future changes in consumer preferences, our share of sales, revenue growth and overall financial results could be negatively affected.\nIncreased competition could hurt our business.\nWe operate in the highly competitive nonalcoholic beverage segment of the commercial beverage industry.

As part of this\nprogram, reports that include analysis of emerging risks as well as the Company's plans and strategies to address them are regularly prepared and presented to senior\nmanagement and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\nChanges in the retail landscape or the loss of key retail or foodservice customers could adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur industry is being affected by the trend toward consolidation in the retail channel, particularly in Europe and the United States. Larger retailers may seek lower prices from\nus and our bottling partners, may demand increased marketing or promotional expenditures, and may be more likely to use their distribution networks to introduce and develop\nprivate label brands, any of which could negatively affect the Coca-Cola system's profitability. In addition, in developed markets, discounters and value stores, as well as the\nvolume of transactions through e-commerce, are growing at a rapid pace. The nonalcoholic beverage retail landscape is also very dynamic and constantly evolving in emerging\nand developing markets, where modern trade is growing at a faster pace than traditional trade outlets.

In 2017, we used 73 functional currencies in addition to the U.S. dollar and derived $20.7 billion of net operating revenues from operations outside the\nUnited States. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues, income and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities,\ninto U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period.\n12\n\n\nTherefore, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies affect our net operating revenues, operating income and the value of balance sheet items\ndenominated in foreign currencies.

Our overall effective income tax rate is a function of applicable\nlocal tax rates and the geographic mix of our income from continuing\n13\n\n\noperations before taxes, which is itself impacted by currency movements.

The results of audits or related disputes could have a material effect on our financial statements for\nthe period or periods for which the applicable final determinations are made and for periods for which the statute of limitations is open.

In the Wisconsin Case, Aqua-Chem sought a declaratory judgment that the Company is responsible for all liabilities and expenses not\ncovered by insurance in connection with certain of Aqua-Chem's general and product liability claims arising from occurrences prior to the Company's sale of Aqua-Chem in\n1981, and a judgment for breach of contract in an amount exceeding $9 million for costs incurred by Aqua-Chem to date in connection with such claims. The Wisconsin Case\ninitially was stayed, pending final resolution of the Georgia Case, and later was voluntarily dismissed without prejudice by Aqua-Chem.\nThe Company owned Aqua-Chem from 1970 to 1981. During that time, the Company purchased over $400 million of insurance coverage, which also insures Aqua-Chem for\nsome of its prior and future costs for certain product liability and other claims. The Company sold Aqua-Chem to Lyonnaise American Holding, Inc., in 1981 under the terms of\na stock sale agreement. The 1981 agreement, and a subsequent 1983 settlement agreement, outlined the parties' rights and obligations concerning past and future claims and\nlawsuits involving Aqua-Chem. Cleaver-Brooks, a division of Aqua-Chem, manufactured boilers, some of which contained asbestos gaskets. Aqua-Chem was first named as a\ndefendant in asbestos lawsuits in or around 1985 and currently has approximately 40,000 active claims pending against it.\nThe parties agreed in 2004 to stay the Georgia Case pending the outcome of insurance coverage litigation filed by certain Aqua-Chem insurers on March 26, 2004. In the\ncoverage action, five plaintiff insurance companies filed suit (Century Indemnity Company, et al. v. Aqua-Chem, Inc., The Coca-Cola Company, et al., Case No. 04CV002852)\nin the Circuit Court, Civil Division of Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, against the Company, Aqua-Chem and 16 insurance companies. Several of the policies that were the\nsubject of the coverage action had been issued to the Company during the period (1970 to 1981) when the Company owned Aqua-Chem. The complaint sought a determination\nof the respective rights and obligations under the insurance policies issued with regard to asbestos-related claims against Aqua-Chem. The action also sought a monetary\njudgment reimbursing any amounts paid by the plaintiffs in excess of their obligations. Two of the insurers, one with a $15 million policy limit and one with a $25 million\npolicy limit, asserted cross-claims against the Company, alleging that the Company and/or its insurers are responsible for Aqua-Chem's asbestos liabilities before any obligation\nis triggered on the part of the cross-claimant insurers to pay for such costs under their policies.\nAqua-Chem and the Company filed and obtained a partial summary judgment determination in the coverage action that the insurers for Aqua-Chem and the Company were\njointly and severally liable for coverage amounts, but reserving judgment on ot",

During the course of the Wisconsin insurance coverage litigation,\nAqua-Chem and the Company reached settlements with several of the insurers, including plaintiffs, who paid funds into escrow accounts for payment of costs arising from the\nasbestos claims against Aqua-Chem. On July 24, 2007, the Wisconsin trial court entered a final declaratory judgment regarding the rights and obligations of the parties under\nthe insurance policies issued by the remaining defendant insurers, which judgment was not appealed. The judgment directs, among other things, that each insurer whose policy\nis triggered is jointly and severally liable for 100 percent of Aqua-Chem's losses up to policy limits. The court's judgment concluded the Wisconsin insurance coverage litigation.\nThe Company and Aqua-Chem continued to pursue and obtain coverage agreements for the asbestos-related claims against Aqua-Chem with those insurance companies that did\nnot settle in the Wisconsin insurance coverage litigation. The Company anticipated that a final settlement with three of those insurers (\"Chartis insurers\") would be finalized in\nMay 2011, but the Chartis insurers repudiated their settlement commitments and, as a result, Aqua-Chem and the Company filed suit against them\n21\n\n\nin Wisconsin state court to enforce the coverage-in-place settlement or, in the alternative, to obtain a declaratory judgment validating Aqua-Chem and the Company's\ninterpretation of the court's judgment in the Wisconsin insurance coverage litigation.\nIn February 2012, the parties filed and argued a number of cross-motions for summary judgment related to the issues of the enforceability of the settlement agreement and the\nexhaustion of policies underlying those of the Chartis insurers. The court granted defendants' motions for summary judgment that the 2011 Settlement Agreement and 2010\nTerm Sheet were not binding contracts, but denied their similar motions related to plaintiffs' claims for promissory and/or equitable estoppel. On or about May 15, 2012, the\nparties entered into a mutually agreeable settlement/stipulation resolving two major issues: exhaustion of underlying coverage and control of defense. On or about January 10,\n2013, the parties reached a settlement of the estoppel claims and all of the remaining coverage issues, with the exception of one disputed issue relating to the scope of the\nChartis insurers' defense obligations in two policy years. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the Company and Aqua-Chem on that one open issue and\nentered a final appealable judgment to that effect following the parties' settlement. On January 23, 2013, the Chartis insurers filed a notice of appeal of the trial court's summary\njudgment ruling. On October 29, 2013, the Wisconsin Court of Appeals affirmed the grant of summary judgment in favor of the Company and Aqua-Chem.

In the\nNotice, the IRS claims that the Company's United States taxable income should be increased by an amount that creates a potential additional federal income tax liability of\napproximately $3.3 billion for the period, plus interest. No penalties were asserted in the Notice. The disputed amounts largely relate to a transfer pricing matter involving the\nappropriate amount of taxable income the Company should report in the United States in connection with its licensing of intangible property to certain related foreign licensees\nregarding the manufacturing, distribution, sale, marketing and promotion of products in overseas markets.\nDuring the 2007-2009 audit period, the Company followed the same transfer pricing methodology for these licenses that had consistently been followed since the methodology\nwas agreed with the IRS in a 1996 closing agreement that applied back to 1987. The closing agreement provided prospective penalty protection as long as the Company\nfollowed the prescribed methodology and material facts and circumstances and relevant federal tax law have not changed. On February 11, 2016, the IRS notified the Company,\nwithout further explanation, that the IRS had determined that material facts and circumstances and relevant federal tax law had changed permitting it to assert penalties. The\nCompany does not agree with this determination. The Company's compliance with the closing agreement was audited and confirmed by the IRS in five successive audit cycles\ncovering the subsequent 11 years through 2006, with the last audit concluding as recently as 2009.\nThe Notice represents a repudiation of the methodology previously adopted in the 1996 closing agreement. The IRS designated the matter for litigation on October 15, 2015. To\nthe extent the matter remains designated, the Company will be prevented from pursuing any administrative settlement at IRS Appeals or under the IRS Advance Pricing and\nMutual Agreement Program.\nThe Company firmly believes that the IRS' claims are without merit and plans to pursue all available administrative and judicial remedies necessary to resolve this matter. To\nthat end, the Company filed a petition in the U.S. Tax Court on December 14, 2015, and the IRS filed its answer on February 12, 2016. On October 4, 2017, the IRS filed an\namended answer to the Company's petition in which it increased its transfer pricing adjustment by $385 million resulting in an additional tax adjustment of $135 million.

Our bottling partners either combine the concentrates with sweeteners (depending on the product), still water and/or sparkling water, or\ncombine the syrups with sparkling water to produce finished beverages.

Across the Coca-Cola system, we are mobilizing our assets in marketing and in community outreach to increase awareness and spur action.\n31\n\n\nWater Quality and Quantity\nWater quality and quantity is an issue that requires our Company's sustained attention and collaboration with other companies, suppliers, governments, nongovernmental\norganizations and communities where we operate. Water is a main ingredient in substantially all of our products, is vital to the production of the agricultural ingredients on\nwhich our business relies and is needed in our manufacturing process. It also is critical to the prosperity of the communities we serve. Water is a limited natural resource facing\nunprecedented challenges from overexploitation, increased food demand, increasing pollution, poor management and the effects of climate change.\nOur Company regularly assesses the specific water-related risks that we and many of our bottling partners face and has implemented a formal water risk management program.\nMitigation of water risk forms the basis of our water stewardship strategic framework. This strategy is executed at the local level where we operate and includes the following\nelements: water use efficiency and wastewater treatment in manufacturing operations; shared watershed protection efforts; engaging local communities; and addressing water\nresource management in our agricultural ingredient supply chain. Such efforts are conducted in collaboration and partnership with others and are intended to help address local\nneeds. Many of these efforts help us in achieving our goal of replenishing the water that we and our bottling partners source and use in our finished products. We are also\ncollaborating with other companies, governments, nongovernmental organizations and communities to advocate for needed water policy reforms and action to protect water\navailability and quality around the world.\nThrough these integrated programs, we believe that our Company can leverage the water-related knowledge we have developed in the communities we serve — through source\nwater availability assessments and planning, water resource management, water treatment, wastewater treatment systems and models for working with communities and\npartners in addressing water and sanitation needs. As demand for water continues to increase around the world, we expect continued action on our part to help with the\nsuccessful long-term stewardship of this critical natural resource, both for our business and the communities we serve.\nEvolving Consumer Preferences\nWe are impacted by shifting consumer demographics and needs, on-the-go lifestyles, aging populations and consu",

Additionally, we manufacture and distribute our products\naccording to strict policies, requirements and specifications set forth in an integrated quality management program that continually measures all operations within the Coca-Cola\nsystem against the same stringent standards.

This disproportionate relationship results in what is known as a variable interest,\nand the entity in which we have the variable interest is referred to as a \"VIE.\" An enterprise must consolidate a VIE if it is determined to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE.\nThe primary beneficiary has both (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance, and (2) the obligation to\nabsorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.\nOur Company holds interests in certain VIEs, primarily bottling and container manufacturing operations, for which we were not determined to be the primary beneficiary.

As a result,\nmanagement must make numerous assumptions which involve a significant amount of judgment when completing recoverability and impairment tests of current and noncurrent\nassets in various regions around the world.\nWe perform recoverability and impairment tests of current and noncurrent assets in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For certain assets, recoverability and/or impairment tests are\nrequired only when conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. For other assets, impairment tests are required at least annually, or more frequently\nif events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired.\nOur equity method investees also perform such recoverability and/or impairment tests. If an impairment charge is recorded by one of our equity method investees, the Company\nrecords its proportionate share of such charge as a reduction of equity income (loss) — net in our consolidated statement of income. However, the actual amount we record with\nrespect to our proportionate share of such charges may be impacted by items such as basis differences, deferred taxes and deferred gains.\nManagement's assessments of the recoverability and impairment tests of noncurrent assets involve critical accounting estimates. These estimates require significant management\njudgment, include inherent uncertainties and are often interdependent; therefore, they do not change in isolation. Factors that management must estimate include, among others,\nthe economic life of the asset, sales volume, pricing, cost of raw materials, delivery costs, inflation, cost of capital, marketing spending, foreign currency exchange rates, tax\nrates, capital spending and proceeds from the sale of assets. These factors are even more difficult to predict when global financial markets are highly volatile.

The charges for the impairment of these\ntrademarks were recorded in Corporate in the line item other operating charges in our consolidated statement of income and were determined by comparing the fair value of the\ntrademarks, derived using discounted cash flow analyses, to the respective carrying values.\nPension Plan Valuations\nOur Company sponsors and/or contributes to pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans covering substantially all U.S. employees. We also sponsor\nnonqualified, unfunded defined benefit pension plans for certain associates and participate in multi-employer pension plans in the United States. In addition, our Company and\nits subsidiaries have various pension plans and other forms of postretirement arrangements outside the United States.\nManagement is required to make certain critical estimates related to actuarial assumptions used to determine our pension expense and obligations. We believe the most critical\nassumptions are related to (1) the discount rate used to determine the present value of the liabilities and (2) the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. All of our\nactuarial assumptions are reviewed annually, or more frequently to the extent that a settlement or curtailment occurs. Changes in these assumptions could have a material impact\non the measurement of our pension expense and obligations.\n38\n\n\nAt each measurement date, we determine the discount rate primarily by reference to rates of high-quality, long-term corporate bonds that mature in a pattern similar to the future\npayments we anticipate making under the plans. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the weighted-average discount rate used to compute our pension obligations was 3.50\npercent and 4.00 percent, respectively.\nEffective January 1, 2016, the Company changed its method of measuring the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for pension and other\npostretirement benefit plans by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the plans' projected cash flows. The Company believes the approach adopted in 2016\nprovides a more precise measurement of these components by improving the correlation between projected cash flows and the corresponding spot rates. The change does not\naffect the measurement of the Company's pension and other postretirement benefit obligations for those plans. During the year ended December 31, 2015, for plans using the\nyield curve approach, the Company measured the service cost and interest cost components utilizing the single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve.\nThe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based upon the long-term outlook of our investment strategy as well as our historical returns a",

Our pension plan investment objective is to ensure all\nof our plans have sufficient funds to meet their benefit obligations when they become due. As a result, the Company periodically revises asset allocations, where appropriate, to\nimprove returns and manage risk. The weighted-average expected long-term rate of return used to calculate our pension expense was 8.00 percent and 8.25 percent in 2017 and\n2016, respectively.\nIn 2017, the Company's total pension expense related to defined benefit plans was $368 million, which included $28 million of net periodic benefit cost and $340 million of\nsettlement charges, curtailment charges and special termination benefit costs. In 2018, we expect our total pension expense to be approximately $17 million, which includes\n$108 million of net periodic benefit income and $125 million of estimated settlement charges and special termination benefit costs expected to be incurred. The decrease in 2018\nexpected net periodic benefit cost is primarily due to 2017 North America refranchising activities, which decreased the size of the active workforce and, therefore, the number of\nemployees earning pension benefits. Favorable asset performance in 2017 further decreased expected 2018 expense, although this was partially offset by a decrease in the\nweighted-average discount rate at December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016. The estimated impact of a 50 basis-point decrease in the discount rate on our 2018 net\nperiodic benefit cost would be an increase to our pension expense of $25 million. Additionally, the estimated impact of a 50 basis-point decrease in the expected long-term rate\nof return on plan assets on our 2018 net periodic benefit cost would be an increase to our pension expense of $29 million.\nThe sensitivity information provided above is based only on changes to the actuarial assumptions used for our U.S. pension plans. As of December 31, 2017, the Company's\nprimary U.S. plan represented 64 percent and 65 percent of the Company's consolidated projected pension benefit obligation and pension assets, respectively.

For our Company, this generally means that we recognize revenue when title to our products is transferred to our bottling partners, resellers or other\ncustomers. Title usually transfers upon shipment to or receipt at our customers' locations, as determined by the specific sales terms of each transaction. Our sales terms do not\nallow for a right of return except for matters related to any manufacturing defects on our part.\nOur customers can earn certain incentives which are included in deductions from revenue, a component of net operating revenues in our consolidated statements of income.\nThese incentives include, but are not limited to, cash discounts, funds for promotional and marketing activities, volume-based incentive programs and support for infrastructure\nprograms. Refer to Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The aggregate deductions from revenue recorded by the Company in relation to these programs,\nincluding amortization expense on infrastructure programs, were $6.2 billion, $6.6 billion and $6.8 billion in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. In preparing the financial\nstatements, management must make estimates related to the contractual terms, customer performance and sales volume to determine the total amounts recorded as deductions\nfrom revenue. Management also considers past results in making such estimates. The actual amounts ultimately paid may be different from our estimates. Such differences are\nrecorded once they have been determined and have historically not been\n39\n\n\nsignificant. The Company will adopt ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and its amendments on January 1, 2018. Adoption of this standard will result in a\nchange in our revenue recognition policy.

The closing agreement provided prospective penalty protection as long as the Company\nfollowed the prescribed methodology and material facts and circumstances and relevant federal tax law have not changed. On February 11, 2016, the IRS notified the Company,\nwithout further explanation, that the IRS had determined that material facts and circumstances and relevant federal tax law had changed permitting it to assert penalties. The\nCompany does not agree with this determination. The Company's compliance with the closing agreement was audited and confirmed by the IRS in five successive audit cycles\ncovering the subsequent 11 years through 2006, with the last audit concluding as recently as 2009.\nThe Notice represents a repudiation of the methodology previously adopted in the 1996 closing agreement.

To\nthe extent the matter remains designated, the Company will be prevented from pursuing any administrative settlement at IRS Appeals or under the IRS Advance Pricing and\nMutual Agreement Program.\nThe Company firmly believes that the IRS' claims are without merit and plans to pursue all available administrative and judicial remedies necessary to resolve this matter.

Based on\nthe evaluation of all available information, the Company recognizes future tax benefits, such as net operating loss carryforwards, to the extent that realizing these benefits is\nconsidered more likely than not.\nWe evaluate our ability to realize the tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets by analyzing our forecasted taxable income using both historical and projected future\noperating results; the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences; taxable income in prior carryback years (if permitted); and the availability of tax planning strategies. A\nvaluation allowance is required to be established unless management determines that it is more likely than not that the Company will ultimately realize the tax benefit\nassociated with a deferred tax asset. As of December 31, 2017, the Company's valuation allowances on deferred tax assets were $501 million and were primarily related to\nuncertainties regarding the future realization of recorded tax benefits on tax loss carryforwards generated in various jurisdictions.

If we were to identify and\nimplement tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or generate sufficient income of the appropriate character in these jurisdictions in the future, it could lead\nto the reversal of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense.

Among other things, the Tax Reform Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35.0 percent to 21.0\npercent effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, transitions the U.S. method of taxation from a worldwide tax system to a modified territorial system and\nrequires companies to pay a one-time transition tax over a period of eight years on the mandatory deemed repatriation of prescribed foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017.\nAt December 31, 2017, we have not yet finalized the calculations of the tax effects of the Tax Reform Act; however, we have calculated a reasonable estimate of the effects on\nour year end income tax provision in accordance with our current understanding of the Tax Reform Act and the available guidance. As a result, the Company recognized a net\nprovisional tax charge in the amount of $3.6 billion in 2017, which is included as a component of income taxes from continuing operations on our consolidated statement of\nincome. We will continue to refine our calculations as additional analysis is completed. In addition, our estimates may also be affected as we gain a more thorough\nunderstanding of the Tax Reform Act as a result of potential legislative or regulatory provisions or interpretive guidance.\nThe one-time transition tax is based on our total accumulated post-1986 prescribed foreign earnings and profits (\"E&P\") estimated to be $42 billion, the majority of which was\npreviously considered to be indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, no U.S. federal and state income taxes had been provided. We recorded a provisional tax amount of $4.6\nbillion as a reasonable estimate for our one-time transition tax liability and a $0.6 billion provisional deferred tax for the related withholding taxes and state income taxes.\nBecause of the complexities of the Tax Reform Act, we are still finalizing our calculation of the total accumulated post-1986 prescribed E&P for the applicable foreign entities.\nFurther, the transition tax is based in part on the amount of those earnings held in cash and other specified assets. This amount may change when we finalize the calculation of\npost-1986 prescribed foreign E&P and finalize the amounts held in cash or other specified assets.

The brands and licenses that the\nCompany acquired impacted the Company's unit case volume and concentrate sales volume and therefore, in addition to being included as a structural change, they are also\nconsidered acquired brands.\nDuring 2016, the Company also deconsolidated our German bottling operations as a result of their being combined to create CCEP. As a result of the transaction, the Company\nnow owns an equity method investment in CCEP. Accordingly, the impact of the deconsolidation and new equity method investment has been included as a structural change in\nour analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for our Europe, Middle East and Africa and Bottling Investments operating segments. The Company\nalso changed our funding arrangement with our bottling partners in China, which resulted in a reduction in net operating revenues with an offsetting reduction in direct\nmarketing expense. The impact of the change in the arrangement has been included as a structural change in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as\nwell as for our Asia Pacific operating segment.\nIn 2015, the Company closed a transaction with Monster (\"Monster Transaction\"), which has been included as a structural change in our analysis of net operating revenues on a\nconsolidated basis as well as for each of the Company's operating segments. This transaction consisted of multiple elements including, but not limited to, the acquisition of\nMonster's non-energy\n43\n\n\nbrands and the expansion of our distribution territories for Monster's energy brands. These elements of the transaction impacted the Company's unit case volume and concentrate\nsales volume and therefore, in addition to being included as a structural change, they are also considered acquired brands.\nAlso during 2015, the Company acquired a South African bottler, which has been included as a structural change in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated\nbasis as well as for the Bottling Investments operating segment.\nThe Company sells concentrates and syrups to both consolidated and ",

The ownership structure of our bottling partners impacts the timing of\nrecognizing concentrate revenue and concentrate sales volume. When we sell concentrates or syrups to our consolidated bottling partners, we are not able to recognize the\nconcentrate revenue or concentrate sales volume until the bottling partner has sold finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups to a third party or\nindependent customer. When we sell concentrates or syrups to our unconsolidated bottling partners, we recognize the concentrate revenue and concentrate sales volume when\nthe concentrates or syrups are sold to the bottling partner. The subsequent sale of the finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups to a customer does not\nimpact the timing of recognizing the concentrate revenue or concentrate sales volume. When we account for an unconsolidated bottling partner as an equity method investment,\nwe eliminate the intercompany profit related to these transactions until the equity method investee has sold finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups to a\nthird party or independent customer.\n \nBeverage Volume\nWe measure the volume of Company beverage products sold in two ways: (1) unit cases of finished products and (2) concentrate sales. As used in this report, \"unit case\" means\na unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings); and \"unit case volume\" means the number of unit cases (or unit case\nequivalents) of Company beverage products directly or indirectly sold by the Company and its bottling partners to customers. Unit case volume primarily consists of beverage\nproducts bearing Company trademarks. Also included in unit case volume are certain products licensed to, or distributed by, our Company, and brands owned by Coca-Cola\nsystem bottlers for which our Company provides marketing support and from the sale of which we derive economic benefit. In addition, unit case volume includes sales by\ncertain joint ventures in which the Company has an equity interest. We believe unit case volume is one of the measures of the underlying strength of the Coca-Cola system\nbecause it measures trends at the consumer level. The unit case volume numbers used in this report are derived based on estimates received by the Company from its bottling\npartners and distributors. Concentrate sales volume represents the amount of concentrates, syrups, beverage bases, source waters, and powders/minerals (in all instances\nexpressed in equivalent unit cases) sold by, or used in finished beverages sold by, the Company to its bottling partners or other customers. Unit case volume and concentrate\nsales volume growth rates are not necessarily equal during any given period.

The Company expects that the expanded productivity initiatives will generate an incremental $2.0 billion in annualized productivity. This productivity will enable\nthe Company to fund marketing initiatives and innovation required to deliver sustainable net revenue growth and will also support margin expansion and increased returns on\ninvested capital over time.

A significant portion of these foreign earnings was previously considered to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign jurisdictions where the\nCompany has made, and will continue to make, substantial investments to support the ongoing development and growth of our international operations. Accordingly, no U.S.\nfederal and state income taxes were previously provided on the portion of our foreign earnings that was considered to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign jurisdictions.

The Tax Reform Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35.0 percent to 21.0 percent effective for tax\nyears beginning after December 31, 2017, transitions the U.S. method of taxation from a worldwide tax system to a modified territorial system and requires companies to pay a\none-time transition tax over a period of eight years on the mandatory deemed repatriation of prescribed foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017.

We use debt financing to lower our\noverall cost of capital, which increases our return on shareowners' equity. This exposes us to adverse changes in interest rates. Our interest expense may also be affected by our\ncredit ratings.\nAs of December 31, 2017, our long-term debt was rated \"AA-\" by Standard & Poor's and \"Aa3\" by Moody's. Our commercial paper program was rated \"A-1+\" by Standard &\nPoor's and \"P-1\" by Moody's. In assessing our credit strength, both agencies consider our capital structure (including the amount and maturity dates of our debt) and financial\npolicies as well as the aggregated balance sheet and other financial information of the Company. In addition, some rating agencies also consider the financial information of\ncertain bottlers, including CCEP, Coca-Cola Amatil Limited, Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated, Coca-Cola FEMSA and Coca-Cola Hellenic. While the Company has no\nlegal obligation for the debt of these bottlers, the rating agencies believe the strategic importance of the bottlers to the Company's business model provides the Company with an\nincentive to keep these bottlers viable. It is our expectation that the credit rating agencies will continue using this methodology. If our credit ratings were to be downgraded as a\nresult of changes in our capital structure, our major bottlers' financial performance, changes in the credit rating agencies' methodology in assessing our credit strength, or for\nany other reason, our cost of borrowing could increase. Additionally, if certain bottlers' credit ratings were to decline, the Company's equity income could be reduced as a result\nof the potential increase in interest expense for those bottlers.\nWe monitor our financial ratios and, as indicated above, the rating agencies consider these ratios in assessing our credit ratings. Each rating agency employs a different\naggregation methodology and has different thresholds for the various financial ratios. These thresholds are not necessarily permanent, nor are they always fully disclosed to our\nCompany.\nOur global presence and strong capital position give us access to key financial markets around the world, enabling us to raise funds at a low effective cost. This posture, coupled\nwith active management of our mix of short-term and long-term debt and our mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt, results in a lower overall cost of borrowing. Our debt\nmanagement policies, in conjunction with our share repurchase program and investment activity, can result in current liabilities exceeding current assets.\nIssuances and payments of debt included both short-term and long-term financing activities.

These\nguarantees are primarily related to third-party customers, bottlers, vendors and container manufacturing operations and have arisen through the normal course of business. These\nguarantees have various terms, and none of these guarantees was individually significant. The amount represents the maximum potential future payments that we could be\nrequired to make under the guarantees; however, we do not consider it probable that we will be required to satisfy these guarantees. Management has concluded that the\nlikelihood of any significant amounts being paid by our Company under these guarantees is not probable. As of December 31, 2017, we were not directly liable for the debt of\nany unconsolidated entity, and we did not have any retained or contingent interest in assets as defined above.\nOur Company recognizes all derivatives as either assets or liabilities at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets.

During the years ended December 31,\n2016 and December 31, 2015, as a result of the continued lack of liquidity and our revised assessment of the U.S. dollar value we expect to realize upon the conversion of\nVenezuelan bolivars into U.S. dollars by our bottling partner to pay our concentrate sales receivables, we recorded write-downs of $76 million and $56 million, respectively.\nThese write-downs were recorded in the line item other operating charges in our consolidated statements of income.\nWe also have certain U.S. dollar",

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nOur Company uses derivative financial instruments primarily to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, commodity prices\nand other market risks. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. As a matter of policy, all of our derivative positions are used to reduce risk by\nhedging an underlying economic exposure. Because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure, fluctuations in the value of the\ninstruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying exposure. The Company generally hedges anticipated exposures up to 36 months in\nadvance; however, the majority of our derivative instruments expire within 24 months or less. Virtually all of our derivatives are straightforward over-the-counter instruments\nwith liquid markets.\nWe monitor our exposure to financial market risks using several objective measurement systems, including a sensitivity analysis to measure our exposure to fluctuations in\nforeign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Refer to Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our\nhedging transactions and derivative financial instruments.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rates\nWe manage most of our foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis, which allows us to net certain exposures and take advantage of any natural offsets. In 2017, we\nused 74 functional currencies and generated $20,683 million of our net operating revenues from operations outside the United States; therefore, weaknesses in some currencies\nmight be offset by strengths in other currencies over time.

We use derivative financial instruments to further reduce our net exposure to foreign currency fluctuations.\nOur Company enters into forward exchange contracts and purchases foreign currency options (principally euros and Japanese yen) and collars to hedge certain portions of\nforecasted cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. Additionally, we enter into forward exchange contracts to offset the earnings impact related to foreign currency\nfluctuations on certain monetary assets and liabilities. We also enter into forward exchange contracts as hedges of net investments in foreign operations.\nThe total notional values of our foreign currency derivatives were $13,057 million and $14,464 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. These values include\nderivative instruments that are designated and qualify for hedge accounting as well as economic hedges. The fair value of the contracts that qualify for hedge accounting resulted\nin a net unrealized gain of $22 million as of December 31, 2017. At the end of 2017, we estimate that a 10 percent weakening of the U.S. dollar would have eliminated the net\nunrealized gain and created a net unrealized loss of $253 million. The fair value of the contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting resulted in a net unrealized loss of\n$50 million, and we estimate that a 10 percent weakening of the U.S. dollar would have increased the net unrealized loss to $105 million.\nInterest Rates\nThe Company is subject to interest rate volatility with regard to existing and future issuances of debt. We monitor our mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt as well as our mix\nof short-term debt and long-term debt. From time to time, we enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations.\nBased on the Company's variable-rate debt and derivative instruments outstanding as of December 31, 2017, we estimate that a 1 percentage point increase in interest rates\nwould have increased interest expense by $252 million in 2017. However, this increase in interest expense would have been partially offset by the increase in interest income\nrelated to higher interest rates.\nThe Company is subject to interest rate risk related to its investments in highly liquid securities. These investments are primarily managed by external managers within the\nguidelines of the Company's investment policy. Our policy requires these investments to be investment grade, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of\nprincipal loss. In addition, our policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. We estimate that a 1 percentage point increase in interest rates would result in a $97\nmillion decrease in the fair value of our portfolio of highly liquid securities.\nCommodity Prices\nThe Company is subject to market risk with respect to commodity price fluctuations, principally related to our purchases of sweeteners, metals, juices, PET and fuels.

We\nmanage our exposure to commodity risks primarily through the use of supplier pricing agreements that enable us to establish the purchase prices for certain inputs that are used\nin our manufacturing and distribution business. When deemed appropriate, we use derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to commodity risks. Certain of these\nderivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, but they are effective economic hedges that help the Company mitigate the price risk associated with the purchases of materials\nused in our manufacturing processes and the fuel used to operate our extensive vehicle fleet.\nOpen commodity derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting had notional values of $35 million and $12 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The fair\nvalue of the contracts that qualify for hedge accounting resulted in a net\n69\n\n\nunrealized loss of $5 million. The potential change in fair value of these commodity derivative instruments, assuming a 10 percent decrease in underlying commodity prices,\nwould have increased the net unrealized loss to $6 million.\nOpen commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting had notional values of $357 million and $447 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nThe fair value of the contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting resulted in a net unrealized gain of $20 million. The potential change in fair value of these commodity\nderivative instruments, assuming a 10 percent decrease in underlying commodity prices, would have eliminated the net unrealized gain and created a net unrealized loss of $18\nmillion.\n70\n\n\n \nITEM 8.

We own or license and market more than 500 nonalcoholic beverage brands, which we group into the\nfollowing category clusters: sparkling soft drinks; water, enhanced water and sports drinks; juice, dairy and plant-based beverages; tea and coffee; and energy drinks. We own\nand market four of the world's top five nonalcoholic sparkling soft drink brands: Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Fanta and Sprite. Finished beverage products bearing our trademarks,\nsold in the United States since 1886, are now sold in more than 200 countries.\nWe make our branded beverage products available to consumers throughout the world through our network of Company-owned or -controlled bottling and distribution\noperations, as well as independent bottling partners, distributors, wholesalers and retailers — the world's largest beverage distribution system. Beverages bearing trademarks\nowned by or licensed to us account for more than 1.9 billion of the approximately 60 billion servings of all beverages consumed worldwide every day.\nOur Company markets, manufactures and sells:\n• beverage concentrates, sometimes referred to as \"beverage bases,\" and syrups, including fountain syrups (we refer to this part of our business as our \"concentrate\nbusiness\" or \"concentrate operations\"); and\n• finished sparkling soft drinks and other nonalcoholic beverages (we refer to this part of our business as our \"finished product business\" or \"finished product\noperations\").\nGenerally, finished product operations generate higher net operating revenues but lower gross profit margins than concentrate operations.\nIn our concentrate operations, we typically generate net operating revenues by selling concentrates and syrups to authorized bottling operations (to which we typically refer as\nour \"bottlers\" or our \"bottling partners\"). Our bottling partners either combine the concentrates with sweeteners (depending on the product), still water and/or sparkling water, or\ncombine the syrups with sparkling water to produce finished beverages. The finished beverages are packaged in authorized containers — such as cans and refillable and\nnonrefillable glass and plastic bottles — bearing our trademarks or trademarks licensed to us  and are then sold to retailers directly or, in some cases, through wholesalers or\nother bottlers. Outside the United States, we also sell concentrates for fountain beverages to",

Our finished product operations generate net operating revenues by selling sparkling soft drinks and a variety of other nonalcoholic beverages, including\nwater, enhanced water and sports drinks; juice, dairy and plant-based beverages; tea and coffee; and energy drinks, to retailers or to distributors, wholesalers and bottling\npartners who distribute them to retailers. In addition, in the United States, we manufacture fountain syrups and sell them to fountain retailers, such as restaurants and\nconvenience stores who use the fountain syrups to produce beverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners who resell the\nfountain syrups to fountain retailers. These fountain syrup sales are included in our North America operating segment. We authorize these wholesalers to resell our fountain\nsyrups through nonexclusive appointments that neither restrict us in setting the prices at which we sell fountain syrups to the wholesalers nor restrict the territories in which the\nwholesalers may resell in the United States.\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"U.S. GAAP\"). The\npreparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses\nand the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Although these estimates are based on our knowledge of\ncurrent events and actions we may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately differ from\n77\n\n\nthese estimates and assumptions. Furthermore, when testing assets for impairment in future periods, if management uses different assumptions or if different conditions occur,\nimpairment charges may result.\nCertain amounts in the prior years' consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been revised to conform to the current year presentation.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nOur Company consolidates all entities that we control by ownership of a majority voting interest. Additionally, there are situations in which consolidation is required even\nthough the usual condition of consolidation (ownership of a majority voting interest) does not apply. Gener",

Generally, this occurs when an entity holds an interest in another business\nenterprise that was achieved through arrangements that do not involve voting interests, which results in a disproportionate relationship between such entity's voting interests in,\nand its exposure to the economic risks and potential rewards of, the other business enterprise. This disproportionate relationship results in what is known as a variable interest,\nand the entity in which we have the variable interest is referred to as a \"VIE.\" An enterprise must consolidate a VIE if it is determined to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE.\nThe primary beneficiary has both (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance, and (2) the obligation to\nabsorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.\nOur Company holds interests in certain VIEs, primarily bottling and container manufacturing operations, for which we were not determined to be the primary beneficiary. Our\nvariable interests in these VIEs primarily relate to equity investments, profit guarantees or subordinated financial support. Refer to Note 11. Although these financial\narrangements resulted in our holding variable interests in these entities, they did not empower us to direct the activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact the VIEs'\neconomic performance. Our Company's investments, plus any loans and guarantees, and other subordinated financial support related to these VIEs totaled $4,523 million and\n$3,709 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, representing our maximum exposures to loss. The Company's investments, plus any loans and guarantees,\nrelated to these VIEs were not individually significant to the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn addition, our Company holds interests in certain VIEs, primarily bottling and container manufacturing operations, for which we were determined to be the primary\nbeneficiary. As a result, we have consolidated these entities. Our Company's investments, plus any loans and guarantees, related to these VIEs totaled $1 million and $203\nmillion as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, representing our maximum exposures to loss. The assets and liabilities of VIEs for which we are the primary\nbeneficiary were not significant to the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nCreditors of our VIEs do not have recourse against the general credit of the Company, regardless of whether they are accounted for as consolidated entities.\nWe use the equity method to account for investments in companies if our investment provides us with the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial\npolicies of the investee.

In October 2017, the\nCompany and Anheuser-Busch InBev (\"ABI\") completed the transition of ABI's controlling interest in Coca-Cola Beverages Africa Proprietary Limited (\"CCBA\") to the\nCompany for $3,150 million, resulting in its consolidation. As CCBA met the criteria for held for sale upon consolidation, we have presented the financial position and results\nof operations of CCBA as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery of products has occurred, the sales price charged is fixed or determinable, and\ncollectibility is reasonably assured. For our Company, this generally means that we recognize revenue when title to our products is transferred to our bottling partners, resellers\nor other customers. In particular, title usually transfers upon shipment to or receipt at our customers' locations, as determined by the specific sales terms of the transactions. Our\nsales terms do not allow for a right of return except for matters related to any manufacturing defects on our part.\nDeductions from Revenue\nOur customers can earn certain incentives including, but not limited to, cash discounts, funds for promotional and marketing activities, volume-based incentive programs and\nsupport for infrastructure programs. The costs associated with these incentives are included in deductions from revenue, a component of net operating revenues in our\nconsolidated statements of income. For customer incentives that must be earned, management must make estimates related to the contractual terms, customer performance and\nsales volume to determine the total amounts earned and to be recorded in deductions from revenue. In making these estimates, management considers past results. The actual\namounts ultimately paid may be different from our estimates.\nIn some situations, the Company may determine it to be advantageous to make advance payments to specific customers to fund certain marketing activities intended to generate\nprofitable volume and/or invest in infrastructure programs with our bottlers that are directed at strengthening our bottling system and increasing unit case volume.

All derivatives are carried at fair\nvalue in our consolidated balance sheets in the following line items, as applicable: prepaid expenses and other assets; other assets; accounts payable and accrued expenses; and\nother liabilities.

Repair and maintenance costs that do not improve service potential or extend economic life are expensed as incurred.\nDepreciation is recorded principally by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of our assets, which are reviewed periodically and generally have the following\nranges: buildings and improvements: 40 years or less; and machinery, equipment and vehicle fleet: 20 years or less. Land is not depreciated, and construction in progress is not\ndepreciated until ready for service. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the remaining lease term, including renewals that\nare deemed to be reasonably assured, or the estimated useful life of the improvement. Depreciation is not recorded during the period in which a long-lived asset or disposal\ngroup is classified as held for sale, even if the asset or disposal group continues to generate revenue during the period. Depreciation expense, including the depreciation expense\nof assets under capital lease, totaled $1,131 million, $1,575 million and $1,735 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Refer to Note 7.\n82\n\n\nGoodwill, Trademarks and Other Intangible Assets\nWe classify intangible assets into three categories: (1) intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization, (2) intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to\namortization and (3) goodwill. We determine the useful lives of our identifiable intangible assets after considering the specific facts and circumstances related to each intangible\nasset. Factors we consider when determining useful lives include the contractual term of any agreement related to the asset, the historical performance of the asset, the\nCompany's long-term strategy for using the asset, any laws or other local regulations which could impact the useful life of the asset, and other economic factors, including\ncompetition and specific market conditions. Intangible assets that are deemed to have definite lives are amortized, primarily on a straight-line basis, over their useful lives,\ngenerally ranging from 1 to 20 years.

If the Company concludes that this is the case, it must perform the testing described above. Otherwise, the Company does not need to perform any\nfurther assessment.\nWe perform impairment tests of goodwill at our reporting unit level, which is one level below our operating segments. Our operating segments are primarily based on\ngeographic responsibility, which is consistent with the way management runs our business. Our operating segments are subdivided into smaller geographic regions or territories\nthat we sometimes refer to as \"business units.\" These business units are also our reporting units. The Bottling Investments operating segment includes all Company-owned or\nconsolidated bottling operations, regardless of geographic location. Generally, each Company-owned or consolidated bottling operation within our Bottling Investments\noperating segment is its own reporting unit. Goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit or units that benefit from the synergies arising from each business combination.\nIn order to test for goodwill impairment, the Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value,\nincluding goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is lower than its carrying amount, goodwill is written down for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the\nfair value. However, the loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. We typically use discounted cash flow models to determine the fair value of a reporting\nunit.

The fair\nvalue of our stock option grants is estimated on the grant date using a Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. The Company recognizes compensation expense on a\nstraight-line basis over the period the grant is earned by the employee, generally four years.\nThe fair value of our restricted stock units, restricted stock and certain performance share units is the quoted market value of the Company's stock on the grant date less the\npresent value of the expected dividends not received during the relevant period. For most performance share units granted beginning in 2014, the Company includes a relative\ntotal shareowner return (\"TSR\") modifier to determine the number of shares earned at the end of the performance period. For these awards, the number of shares earned based\non the certified achievement of the predefined performance criteria will be reduced or increased if the Company's total shareowner return over the performance period relative to\na predefined compensation comparator group of companies falls outside of a defined range. The fair value of performance share units that include the TSR modifier is\ndetermined using a Monte Carlo valuation model.\nIn the period it becomes probable that the minimum performance criteria specified in the performance share award will be achieved, we recognize expense for the proportionate\nshare of the total fair value of the award related to the vesting period that has already lapsed. The remaining fair value of the award is expensed on a straight-line basis over the\nbalance of the vesting period. In the event the Company determines it is no longer probable that we will achieve the minimum performance criteria specified in the award, we\nreverse all of the previously recognized compensation expense in the period such a determination is made. The Company has made a policy election to estimate the number of\nawards that are expected to vest to determine the amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized in earnings. Forfeiture estimates are trued-up through the vesting\ndate, in order to ensure that total compensation expense is recognized only for those awards that ultimately vest.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between\nthe financial reporting basis and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. The tax rate used to determine the deferred tax assets and liabilities is the enacted tax rate for the\nyear and manner in which the differences are expected to reverse.

For purposes of evaluating whether or not a tax position is uncertain, (1) we presume the tax position will be\nexamined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information; (2) the technical merits of a tax position are derived from authorities such as\nlegislation and statutes, legislative intent, regulations, rulings and case law and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position; and (3) each tax position is\nevaluated without consideration of the possibility of offset or aggregation with other tax positions taken. A number of years may elapse before a particular uncertain tax position\nis audited and finally resolved or when a tax assessment is raised. The number of years subject to tax assessments varies depending on the tax jurisdiction.

The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services equal to the amount\nthat it expects to be entitled to receive for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 also requires additional disclosures about the nature, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash\nflows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments.

This\nbottler was deconsolidated in conjunction with the Coca-Cola Beverages Africa Proprietary Limited transaction discussed further below.\nMonster Beverage Corporation\nIn June 2015, the Company and Monster entered into a long-term strategic relationship in the global energy drink category (\"Monster Transaction\"). As a result of the Monster\nTransaction, (1) the Company purchased newly issued shares of Monster common stock representing approximately 17 percent of the outstanding shares of Monster common\nstock (after giving effect to the new issuance); (2) the Company sold its global energy drink business (including NOS, Full Throttle, Burn, Mother, Play and Power Play, and\nRelentless) to Monster, and the Company acquired Monster's non-energy drink business (including Hansen's Natural Sodas, Peace Tea, Hubert's Lemonade and Hansen's Juice\nProducts); and (3) the parties amended their distribution coordination agreements to expand distribution of Monster products into additional territories pursuant to long-term\nagreements with the Company's existing network of Company-owned or -controlled bottling operations and independent distribution partners. The Company and its bottling\npartners (\"Coca-Cola system\") also became Monster's preferred global distribution partner. The Company made a net cash payment of $2,150 million to Monster, of which $125\nmillion was originally held in escrow, subject to release upon achievement of milestones relating to the transfer of Monster's domestic distribution rights to our distribution\nnetwork. The $125 million originally held in escrow was transferred to Monster in 2017 upon achievement of the related milestones.\nThe Monster Transaction consisted of multiple elements including the purchase of common stock, the acquisition and divestiture of businesses and the expansion of distribution\nterritories. When consideration transferred is not solely in the form of cash, measurement is based on either the cost to the acquiring entity (the fair value of the assets given) or\nthe fair value of the assets acquired, whichever is more clearly evident and, thus, more reliably measurable. As the majority of the consideration\n88\n\n\ntransferred was cash, we believe the fair value of the consideration transferred is more reliably measurable.

These distribution rights are governed by an agreement with an initial term of 20 years, after which it will continue to remain in\neffect unless otherwise terminated by either party, and there are no future costs of renewal.

As these payments are dependent on future sales, they are a form of contingent\nconsideration.

(\"Keurig\") for $1,567 million. In February 2015, the Company purchased an\nadditional 4 percent ownership interest from Credit Suisse Capital LLC under an agreement for a total purchase price of $830 million.

We recorded a loss of $6 million as a result of the exercise price being lower than our carrying value of these shares. As a result of this transaction,\nthe Company's ownership was reduced to 34 percent of the entity's outstanding shares. The owners of the majority interest have a remaining option to acquire an additional 14\npercent interest of the entity's outstanding shares at any time through December 31, 2019, based on an agreed-upon formula.\nAssets and Liabilities Held for Sale\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had entered into agreements to refranchise its U.S. Virgin Islands bottling territories.

These changes in market conditions may adversely impact the Company's financial\nperformance and are referred to as \"market risks.\" When deemed appropriate, our Company uses derivatives as a risk management tool to mitigate the potential impact of\ncertain market risks. The primary market risks managed by the Company through the use of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments are foreign currency exchange\nrate risk, commodity price risk and interest rate risk.\nThe Company uses various types of derivative instruments including, but not limited to, forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, option contracts, collars and swaps.\nForward contracts and commodity futures contracts are agreements to buy or sell a quantity of a currency or commodity at a predetermined future date, and at a predetermined\nrate or price. An option contract is an agreement that conveys the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a quantity of a currency or commodity at a\npredetermined rate or price during a period or at a time in the future. A collar is a strategy that uses a combination of options to limit the range of possible positive or negative\nreturns on an underlying asset or liability to a specific range, or to protect expected future cash flows. To do this, an investor simultaneously buys a put option and sells (writes)\na call option, or alternatively buys a call option and sells (writes) a put option. A swap agreement is a contract between two parties to exchange cash flows based on specified\nunderlying notional amounts, assets and/or indices. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. The Company may also designate certain non-\nderivative instruments, such as our foreign-denominated debt, in hedging relationships.\nAll derivatives are carried at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets, primarily in the following line items, as applicable: prepaid expenses and other assets; other assets;\naccounts payable and accrued expenses; and other liabilities. The carrying values of the derivatives reflect the impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash\ncollateral held or placed\n96\n\n\nwith the same counterparties, as applicable. These master netting agreements allow the Company to net settle positive and negative positions (assets and liabilities) arising from\ndifferent transactions with the same counterparty.\nThe accounting for gains and losses that result from changes in the fair values of derivative instruments depends on wh",

Derivatives can be designated as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign\noperations. The changes in the fair values of derivatives that have been designated and qualify for fair value hedge accounting are recorded in the same line item in our\nconsolidated statement of income as the changes in the fair values of the hedged items attributable to the risk being hedged. The changes in the fair values of derivatives that\nhave been designated and qualify as cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign operations are recorded in AOCI and are reclassified into the line item in our\nconsolidated statement of income in which the hedged items are recorded in the same period the hedged items affect earnings. Due to the high degree of effectiveness between\nthe hedging instruments and the underlying exposures being hedged, fluctuations in the value of the derivative instruments are generally offset by changes in the fair values or\ncash flows of the underlying exposures being hedged. The changes in the fair values of derivatives that were not designated and/or did not qualify as hedging instruments are\nimmediately recognized into earnings.\nFor derivatives that will be accounted for as hedging instruments, the Company formally designates and documents, at inception, the financial instrument as a hedge of a\nspecific underlying exposure, the risk management objective and the strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction. In addition, the Company formally assesses, both at the\ninception and at least quarterly thereafter, whether the financial instruments used in hedging transactions are effective at offsetting changes in either the fair values or cash flows\nof the related underlying exposures. Any ineffective portion of a financial instrument's change in fair value is immediately recognized into earnings.\nThe Company determines the fair values of its derivatives based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current market rates. Refer to Note 16. The notional amounts\nof the derivative financial instruments do not necessarily represent amounts exchanged by the parties and, therefore, are not a direct measure of our exposure to the financial\nrisks described above. The amounts exchanged are calculated by reference to the notional amounts and by other terms of the derivatives, such as interest rates, foreign currency\nexchange rates, commodity rates or other financial indices. The Company does not view the fair values of its derivatives in isolation but rather in relation to the fair values or\ncash flows of the underlying hedged transactions or other exposures.

Refer to Note 16 for the net presentation of the Company's derivative instruments.\n2 Refer to Note 16 for additional information related to the estimated fair\nvalue.\nCredit Risk Associated with Derivatives\nWe have established strict counterparty credit guidelines and enter into transactions only with financial institutions of investment grade or better. We monitor counterparty\nexposures regularly and review any downgrade in credit rating immediately. If a downgrade in the credit rating of a counterparty were to occur, we have provisions requiring\ncollateral for substantially all of our transactions. To mitigate presettlement risk, minimum credit standards become more stringent as the duration of the derivative financial\ninstrument increases. In addition, the Company's master netting agreements reduce credit risk by permitting the Company to net settle for transactions with the same\ncounterparty. To minimize the concentration of credit risk, we enter into derivative transactions with a portfolio of financial institutions. Based on these factors, we consider the\nrisk of counterparty default to be minimal.\nCash Flow Hedging Strategy\nThe Company uses cash flow hedges to minimize the variability in cash flows of assets or liabilities or forecasted transactions caused by fluctuations in foreign currency\nexchange rates, commodity prices or interest rates. The changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in AOCI and are reclassified into the\nline item in our consolidated statement of income in which the hedged items are recorded in the same period the hedged items affect earnings. The changes in fair values of\nhedges that are determined to be ineffective are immediately reclassified from AOCI into earnings. The maximum length of time for which the Company hedges its exposure to\nthe variability in future cash flows is typically three years.\nThe Company maintains a foreign currency cash flow hedging program to reduce the risk that our eventual U.S. dollar net cash inflows from sales outside the United States and\nU.S. dollar net cash outflows from procurement activities will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

Refer to Note 14.\nOn September 17, 2015, the Company received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (\"Notice\") from the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") for the tax years 2007 through 2009,\nafter a five-year audit. In the Notice, the IRS claims that the Company's United States taxable income should be increased by an amount that creates a potential additional\nfederal income tax liability of approximately $3.3 billion for the period, plus interest. No penalties were asserted in the Notice. The disputed amounts largely relate to a transfer\npricing matter involving the appropriate amount of taxable income the Company should report in the United States in connection with its licensing of intangible property to\ncertain related foreign licensees regarding the manufacturing, distribution, sale, marketing and promotion of products in overseas markets.\nDuring the 2007-2009 audit period, the Company followed the same transfer pricing methodology for these licenses that had consistently been followed since the methodology\nwas agreed with the IRS in a 1996 closing agreement that applied back to 1987. The closing agreement provided prospective penalty protection as long as the Company\nfollowed the prescribed methodology and material facts and circumstances and relevant federal tax law have not changed. On February 11, 2016, the IRS notified the Company,\nwithout further explanation, that the IRS had determined that material facts and circumstances and relevant federal tax law had changed permitting it to assert penalties. The\nCompany does not agree with this determination. The Company's compliance with the closing agreement was audited and confirmed by the IRS in five successive audit cycles\ncovering the subsequent 11 years through 2006, with the last audit concluding as recently as 2009.\nThe Notice represents a repudiation of the methodology previously adopted in the 1996 closing agreement. The IRS designated the matter for litigation on October 15, 2015. To\nthe extent the matter remains designated, the Company will be prevented from pursuing any administrative settlement at IRS Appeals or under the IRS Advance Pricing and\nMutual Agreement Program.\nThe Company firmly believes that the IRS' claims are without merit and plans to pursue all available administrative and judicial remedies necessary to resolve this matter. To\nthat end, the Company filed a petition in the U.S. Tax Court on\n110\n\n\nDecember 14, 2015, and the IRS filed its answer on February 12, 2016. On October 4, 2017, the IRS filed an amended answer to the Company's petition in which it increased its\ntransfer pricing adjustment by $385 million resulting in an additional tax adjustment of $135 million.

Our self-insurance reserves totaled $480 million and $527 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nWorkforce (Unaudited)\nWe refer to our employees as \"associates.\" As of December 31, 2017, our Company had approximately 61,800 associates, of which approximately 12,400 associates were\nlocated in the United States. Our Company, through its divisions and subsidiaries, is a party to numerous collective bargaining agreements. As of December 31, 2017,\napproximately 3,700 associates, excluding seasonal hires, in North America were covered by collective bargaining agreements. These agreements typically have terms of three\nyears to five years years. We currently expect that we will be able to renegotiate such agreements on satisfactory terms when they expire. The Company believes that its\nrelations with its associates are generally satisfactory.\nOperating Leases\nThe following table summarizes our minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases with initial or remaining lease terms in excess of one year as of\nDecember 31, 2017 (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\nOperating Lease\nPayments\n2018\n$\n130\n2019\n85\n2020\n69\n2021\n59\n2022\n52\nThereafter\n147\nTotal minimum operating lease payments1\n$\n542\n1 Income associated with sublease arrangements is not\nsignificant.\n \nNOTE 12: STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS\nOur Company grants awards under its stock-based compensation plans to certain employees of the Company.

The 2014 Equity Plan allows for grants of stock options,\nperformance share units, restricted stock units, restricted stock and other specified award types, including cash awards with performance-based vesting criteria. Beginning in\n2015, the 2014 Equity Plan was the primary plan in use for equity awards and performance cash awards. There were no grants made from the 2014 Equity Plan prior to 2015. As\nof December 31, 2017, there were 413.6 million shares available to be granted under the 2014 Equity Plan.

Economic profit and net operating revenues are adjusted for certain items, which are approved and certified by the Audit Committee of the Board of\nDirectors. The purpose of these adjustments is to ensure a consistent year-to-year comparison of the specific performance criteria. In the event the certified results equal the\npredefined performance criteria, the Company will grant the number of shares equal to the target award. In the event the certified results exceed the predefined performance\ncriteria, additional shares up to the maximum award will be granted. In the event the certified results fall below the predefined performance criteria, a reduced number of shares\nwill be granted. If the certified results fall below the threshold award performance level, no shares will be granted. The performance share units granted under this program are\nthen generally subject to a holding period of one year before the shares are released.\nPerformance share units generally do not entitle participants to vote or receive dividends. For most performance share units granted beginning in 2014, the Company includes a\nrelative TSR modifier to determine the number of shares earned at the end of the performance period. For these awards, the number of shares earned based on the certified\nachievement of the predefined performance criteria will be reduced or increased if the Company's total shareowner return over the performance period relative to a predefined\ncompensation comparator group of companies falls outside of a defined range. The fair value of performance share units that include the TSR modifier is determined using a\nMonte Carlo valuation model. For the remaining awards that do not include the TSR modifier, the fair value of the performance share units is the quoted market value of the\nCompany's stock on the grant date less the present value of the expected dividends not received during the relevant period.\nIn the period it becomes probable that the minimum performance criteria specified in the award will be achieved, we recognize expense for the proportionate share of the total\nfair value of the performance share units related to the vesting period that has already lapsed for the shares expected to vest and be released.

We have established asset allocation targets and investment\nguidelines with each investment manager. Our asset allocation targets promote optimal expected return and volatility characteristics given the long-term time horizon for\nfulfilling the obligations of\n116\n\n\nthe plans. Selection of the targeted asset allocation for U.S. plan assets was based upon a review of the expected return and risk characteristics of each asset class, as well as the\ncorrelation of returns among asset classes. Our target allocation is a mix of 42 percent equity investments, 30 percent fixed-income investments and 28 percent alternative\ninvestments. We believe this target allocation will enable us to achieve the following long-term investment objectives:\n(1) optimize the long-term return on plan assets at an acceptable level of\nrisk;\n(2) maintain a broad diversification across asset classes and among investment managers;\nand\n(3) maintain careful control of the risk level within each asset\nclass.\nThe guidelines that have been established with each investment manager provide parameters within which the investment managers agree to operate, including criteria that\ndetermine eligible and ineligible securities, diversification requirements and credit quality standards, where applicable. Unless exceptions have been approved, investment\nmanagers are prohibited from buying or selling commodities, futures or option contracts, as well as from short selling of securities. Additionally, investment managers agree to\nobtain written approval for deviations from stated investment style or guidelines. As of December 31, 2017, no investment manager was responsible for more than 9 percent of\ntotal U.S. plan assets.\nOur target allocation of 42 percent equity investments is composed of 60 percent global equities, 16 percent emerging market equities and 24 percent domestic small- and mid-\ncap equities. Optimal returns through our investments in global equities are achieved through security selection as well as country and sector diversification. Investments in the\ncommon stock of our Company accounted for approximately 4 percent of our total global equities and approximately 2 percent of total U.S. plan assets. Our investments in\nglobal equities are intended to provide diversified exposure to both U.S. and non-U.S. equity markets. Our investments in both emerging market equities and domestic small-\nand mid-cap equities may experience large swings in their market value.

The objective of investing in\nalternative investments is to provide a higher rate of return than that available from publicly traded equity securities. These investments are inherently illiquid and require a\nlong-term perspective in evaluating investment performance.\nInvestment Strategy for Non-U.S. Pension Plans\nAs of December 31, 2017, the long-term target allocation for 73 percent of our international subsidiaries' pension plan assets, primarily certain of our European and Canadian\nplans, is 71 percent equity securities, 10 percent fixed-income securities and 19 percent other investments. The actual allocation for the remaining 27 percent of the Company's\ninternational subsidiaries' plan assets consisted of 55 percent mutual, pooled and commingled funds; 5 percent fixed-income securities; and 40 percent other investments. The\ninvestment strategies for our international subsidiaries' plans differ greatly, and in some instances are influenced by local law. None of our pension plans outside the United\nStates is individually significant for separate disclosure.\nOther Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets\nPlan assets associated with other postretirement benefits primarily represent funding of one of the U.S. postretirement benefit plans through a Voluntary Employee Beneficiary\nAssociation (\"VEBA\"), a tax-qualified trust. The VEBA assets are primarily invested in liquid assets due to the level and timing of expected future benefit payments.\n117\n\n\nThe following table presents total assets for our other postretirement benefit plans (in millions):\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n78\n$\n2\nEquity securities:\n \n \nU.S.-based companies\n96\n116\nInternational-based companies\n8\n8\nFixed-income securities:\n \n \nGovernment bonds\n2\n3\nCorporate bonds and debt securities\n7\n6\nMutual, pooled and commingled funds\n80\n103\nHedge funds/limited partnerships\n8\n9\nReal estate\n5\n4\nOther\n4\n4\nTotal other postretirement benefit plan assets1\n$\n288\n$\n255\n1 Fair value disclosures related to our other postretirement ",

For other non-U.S. plans, we base the discount rate on comparable\nindices within each of the countries. The rate of compensation increase assumption is determined by the Company based upon annual reviews. We review external data and our\nown historical trends for health care costs to determine the health care cost trend rate assumptions.\nEffective January 1, 2016, for benefit plans using the yield curve approach, the Company changed the method used to calculate the service cost and interest cost components of\nnet periodic benefit cost for pension and other postretirement benefit plans and is measuring these components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the\nplans' projected cash flows. The Company believes the new approach provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between\nprojected cash flows and the corresponding spot rates.

In accordance with SAB 118, the Company has determined that the net tax charge of $3.6 billion recorded in connection with the tax effect of the Tax Reform Act is a\nprovisional amount and a reasonable estimate as of December 31, 2017.

If we were to identify and implement tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or generate sufficient income\nof the appropriate character in these jurisdictions in the future, it could lead to the reversal of these\n124\n\n\nvaluation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense. The Company believes that it will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the\nremaining net deferred tax assets in our consolidated balance sheet.\nIn 2017, the Company recognized a net decrease of $29 million in its valuation allowances. This decrease was primarily due to the reversal of a valuation allowance in a foreign\njurisdiction related to expenses incurred in the normal course of business that were previously determined to be non-deductible. In addition, the decrease in value of certain\ndeferred tax assets and related valuation allowance due to the reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate and changes to deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances on\ncertain equity investments contributed to the net decrease in the valuation allowance.

This includes certain\npricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs.\nRecurring Fair Value Measurements\nIn accordance with U.S. GAAP, certain assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. For our Company, the only assets and liabilities that\nare adjusted to fair value on a recurring basis are investments in equity and debt securities classified as trading or available-for-sale and derivative financial instruments.\nAdditionally, the Company adjusts the carrying value of certain long-term debt as a result of the Company's fair value hedging strategy.\nInvestments in Trading and Available-for-Sale Securities\nThe fair values of our investments in trading and available-for-sale securities using quoted market prices from daily exchange traded markets are based on the closing price as of\nthe balance sheet date and are classified as Level 1. The fair values of our investments in trading and available-for-sale securities classified as Level 2 are priced using quoted\nmarket prices for similar instruments or nonbinding market prices that are corroborated by observable market data. Inputs into these valuation techniques include actual trade\ndata, benchmark yields, broker/dealer quotes and other similar data. These inputs are obtained from quoted market prices, independent pricing vendors or other sources.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe fair values of our futures contracts are primarily determined using quoted contract prices on futures exchange markets. The fair values of these instruments are based on the\nclosing contract price as of the balance sheet date and are classified as Level 1.\nThe fair values of our derivative instruments other than futures are determined using standard valuation models. The significant inputs used in these models are readily available\nin public markets, or can be derived from observable market transactions, and therefore have been classified as Level 2. Inputs used in these standard valuation models for\nderivative instruments other than futures include the applicable exchange rates, forward rates, interest rates, discount rates and commodity prices. The standard valuation model\nfor options also uses implied volatility as an additional input. The discount rates are based on the historical U.S. Deposit or U.S. Treasury rates, and the implied volatility\nspecific to options is based on quoted rates from financial institutions.\nIncluded in the fair value of derivative instruments is an adjustment for nonperformance risk.

Additionally, the Company recorded impairment charges of $34\nmillion related to Venezuelan intangible assets due to weaker sales and the volatility of foreign currency exchange rates resulting from continued political instability.

This program is focused on the following initiatives: global supply chain optimization; global marketing and innovation effectiveness;\noperating expense leverage and operational excellence; data and information technology systems standardization; and the integration of Old CCE's North American bottling\noperations.\nIn February 2014, the Company announced the expansion of our productivity and reinvestment program to drive incremental productivity that will primarily be redirected into\nincreased media investments. Our incremental productivity goal consists of two relatively equal components. First, we will expand savings through global supply chain\noptimization, data and information technology systems standardization, and resource and cost reallocation. Second, we will increase the effectiveness of our marketing\ninvestments by transforming our marketing and commercial model to redeploy resources into more consumer-facing marketing investments to accelerate growth.\nIn October 2014, the Company announced that we were further expanding our productivity and reinvestment program and extending it through 2019. The expansion of the\nproductivity initiatives will focus on four key areas: restructuring the Company's global supply chain; implementing zero-based work, an evolution of zero-based budget\nprinciples, across the organization; streamlining and simplifying the Company's operating model; and further driving increased discipline and efficiency in direct marketing\ninvestments.\nIn April 2017, the Company announced its plans to transition to a new, more agile operating model to enable growth. Under this operating model, our business units will be\nsupported by an expanded enabling services organization and a corporate center focused on a few strategic initiatives, policy and governance. The expanded enabling services\norganization will focus on both simplifying and standardizing key transactional processes and providing support to business units through global centers of excellence.\nThe Company has incurred total pretax expenses of $3,058 million related to this program since it commenced.

In such instances, we or our authorized\nsuppliers sell Company Trademark Beverages to the bottlers for sale and distribution throughout the designated territory, often on a nonexclusive basis.\nBottler's Agreements Within the United States\nIn the United States, most bottlers operate under a \"comprehensive beverage agreement\" (\"CBA\") that is of stated duration, subject in most cases to renewal rights of bottlers\nand in some cases to renewal rights of the Company. Certain bottlers continue to operate under legacy bottler's agreements with no stated expiration date for Trademark Coca-\nCola Beverages and other cola-flavored beverages. The bottler's agreements in the United States are subject to termination by the Company for nonperformance or upon the\noccurrence of certain defined events of default that may vary from contract to contract.\nIn conjunction with implementing a new beverage partnership model in North America, the Company granted certain additional exclusive territory rights for the distribution,\npromotion, marketing and sale of Company-owned and licensed beverage products (as defined by the CBAs) to certain U.S. bottlers. These expanding bottlers entered into new\nCBAs, to which we sometimes refer as \"expanding bottler CBAs,\" which apply to newly granted territories as well as any legacy territories, and provide consistency across each\nsuch bottler's respective territory and consistency with other U.S. bottlers that have executed an expanding bottler CBA.

This baseline price may be adjusted periodically by the Company, up to a\nmaximum indexed ceiling price, and is adjusted quarterly based upon changes in certain sugar or sweetener prices, as applicable. The U.S. unit case volume manufactured, sold\nand distributed under these legacy bottler's agreements is not material.\nUnder the terms of the bottler's agreements, bottlers in the United States generally are not authorized to manufacture fountain syrups.

Generally, these raw\nmaterials are readily available from numerous sources. However, our Company purchases aspartame, an important non-nutritive sweetener that is used alone or in combination\nwith other important non-nutritive sweeteners such as saccharin or acesulfame potassium in our low- and no-calorie sparkling beverage products, primarily from\nAjinomoto Co., Inc. and SinoSweet Co., Ltd., which we consider to be our primary sources for the supply of this product. In addition, we purchase sucralose, which we consider\na critical raw material, from a limited number of suppliers in the United States and China. We work closely with our primary sucralose suppliers to maintain continuity of\nsupply. However, global demand for sucralose has increased in recent years as consumer products companies are reformulating food and beverages to replace high-intensity\nsweeteners with non-nutritive sweeteners, primarily sucralose. In addition, the Chinese sucralose industry has been impacted by the imposition of stringent environmental\nrequirements that have reduced or closed production. To mitigate the impact of the increase in demand and tightening of supply of sucralose, we are working with our existing\nsuppliers to secure additional volume and are expanding our sucralose supplier base as well as assessing additional internal contingency plans to address any potential shortages.\nOur Company generally has not experienced major difficulties in obtaining its requirements for non-nutritive sweeteners and we do not anticipate such difficulties in the future.\nJuice and juice concentrate from various fruits, particularly orange juice and orange juice concentrate, are the principal raw materials for our juice and juice drink products.

If these types of requirements become applicable to one or more of our major products under current or future\nenvironmental or health laws or regulations, they may inhibit sales of such products.\nFor example, under one such law in California, known as Proposition 65, if the state has determined that a substance causes cancer or harms human reproduction, a warning\nmust be provided for any product sold in the state that exposes consumers to that substance. For additional information regarding Proposition 65, refer to the heading\n\"Governmental Regulation\" set forth in Part I, \"Item 1. Business\" of this report. If we were required to add Proposition 65 warnings on the labels of one or more of our beverage\nproducts produced for sale in California, the resulting consumer reaction to the warnings and possible adverse publicity could negatively affect our sales both in California and\nin other markets.\nUnfavorable general economic conditions in the United States could negatively impact our financial performance.\nIn 2017, our net operating revenues in the United States were $14.7 billion, or 42 percent, of our total net operating revenues. Unfavorable general economic conditions, such as\na recession or economic slowdown, in the United States could negatively affect the affordability of, and consumer demand for, our beverages in our flagship market. Under\ndifficult economic conditions, consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of our products or by shifting away from our beverages to lower-\npriced products offered by other companies, including private label brands. Softer consumer demand for our beverages in the United States could reduce our profitability and\ncould negatively affect our overall financial performance.\nUnfavorable economic and political conditions in international markets could hurt our business.\nWe derive a significant portion of our net operating revenues from sales of our products in international markets. In 2017, our operations outside the United States accounted for\n$20.7 billion, or 58 percent, of our total net operating revenues. Unfavorable economic conditions and financial uncertainties in our major international markets, including\nuncertainties surrounding the United Kingdom's impending withdrawal from the European Union, commonly referred to as \"Brexit,\" and unstable political conditions, including\ncivil unrest and governmental changes, in certain of our other international markets could undermine global consumer confidence and reduce consumers' purchasing power,\nthereby reducing demand for our products.

In the Wisconsin Case, Aqua-Chem sought a declaratory judgment that the Company is responsible for all liabilities and expenses not\ncovered by insurance in connection with certain of Aqua-Chem's general and product liability claims arising from occurrences prior to the Company's sale of Aqua-Chem in\n1981, and a judgment for breach of contract in an amount exceeding $9 million for costs incurred by Aqua-Chem to date in connection with such claims. The Wisconsin Case\ninitially was stayed, pending final resolution of the Georgia Case, and later was voluntarily dismissed without prejudice by Aqua-Chem.\nThe Company owned Aqua-Chem from 1970 to 1981. During that time, the Company purchased over $400 million of insurance coverage, which also insures Aqua-Chem for\nsome of its prior and future costs for certain product liability and other claims. The Company sold Aqua-Chem to Lyonnaise American Holding, Inc., in 1981 under the terms of\na stock sale agreement. The 1981 agreement, and a subsequent 1983 settlement agreement, outlined the parties' rights and obligations concerning past and future claims and\nlawsuits involving Aqua-Chem. Cleaver-Brooks, a division of Aqua-Chem, manufactured boilers, some of which contained asbestos gaskets. Aqua-Chem was first named as a\ndefendant in asbestos lawsuits in or around 1985 and currently has approximately 40,000 active claims pending against it.\nThe parties agreed in 2004 to stay the Georgia Case pending the outcome of insurance coverage litigation filed by certain Aqua-Chem insurers on March 26, 2004. In the\ncoverage action, five plaintiff insurance companies filed suit (Century Indemnity Company, et al. v. Aqua-Chem, Inc., The Coca-Cola Company, et al., Case No. 04CV002852)\nin the Circuit Court, Civil Division of Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, against the Company, Aqua-Chem and 16 insurance companies. Several of the policies that were the\nsubject of the coverage action had been issued to the Company during the period (1970 to 1981) when the Company owned Aqua-Chem. The complaint sought a determination\nof the respective rights and obligations under the insurance policies issued with regard to asbestos-related claims against Aqua-Chem. The action also sought a monetary\njudgment reimbursing any amounts paid by the plaintiffs in excess of their obligations. Two of the insurers, one with a $15 million policy limit and one with a $25 million\npolicy limit, asserted cross-claims against the Company, alleging that the Company and/or its insurers are responsible for Aqua-Chem's asbestos liabilities before any obligation\nis triggered on the part of the cross-claimant insurers to pay for such costs under their policies.\nAqua-Chem and the Company filed and obtained a partial summary judgment determination in the coverage action that the insurers for Aqua-Chem and the Company were\njointly and severally liable for coverage amounts, but reserving judgment on ot",

During the course of the Wisconsin insurance coverage litigation,\nAqua-Chem and the Company reached settlements with several of the insurers, including plaintiffs, who paid funds into escrow accounts for payment of costs arising from the\nasbestos claims against Aqua-Chem. On July 24, 2007, the Wisconsin trial court entered a final declaratory judgment regarding the rights and obligations of the parties under\nthe insurance policies issued by the remaining defendant insurers, which judgment was not appealed. The judgment directs, among other things, that each insurer whose policy\nis triggered is jointly and severally liable for 100 percent of Aqua-Chem's losses up to policy limits. The court's judgment concluded the Wisconsin insurance coverage litigation.\nThe Company and Aqua-Chem continued to pursue and obtain coverage agreements for the asbestos-related claims against Aqua-Chem with those insurance companies that did\nnot settle in the Wisconsin insurance coverage litigation. The Company anticipated that a final settlement with three of those insurers (\"Chartis insurers\") would be finalized in\nMay 2011, but the Chartis insurers repudiated their settlement commitments and, as a result, Aqua-Chem and the Company filed suit against them\n21\n\n\nin Wisconsin state court to enforce the coverage-in-place settlement or, in the alternative, to obtain a declaratory judgment validating Aqua-Chem and the Company's\ninterpretation of the court's judgment in the Wisconsin insurance coverage litigation.\nIn February 2012, the parties filed and argued a number of cross-motions for summary judgment related to the issues of the enforceability of the settlement agreement and the\nexhaustion of policies underlying those of the Chartis insurers. The court granted defendants' motions for summary judgment that the 2011 Settlement Agreement and 2010\nTerm Sheet were not binding contracts, but denied their similar motions related to plaintiffs' claims for promissory and/or equitable estoppel. On or about May 15, 2012, the\nparties entered into a mutually agreeable settlement/stipulation resolving two major issues: exhaustion of underlying coverage and control of defense. On or about January 10,\n2013, the parties reached a settlement of the estoppel claims and all of the remaining coverage issues, with the exception of one disputed issue relating to the scope of the\nChartis insurers' defense obligations in two policy years. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the Company and Aqua-Chem on that one open issue and\nentered a final appealable judgment to that effect following the parties' settlement. On January 23, 2013, the Chartis insurers filed a notice of appeal of the trial court's summary\njudgment ruling. On October 29, 2013, the Wisconsin Court of Appeals affirmed the grant of summary judgment in favor of the Company and Aqua-Chem.

On April\n16, 2014, the Supreme Court of Wisconsin denied the Chartis insurers' petition for review.\nThe Georgia Case remains subject to the stay agreed to in 2004.\nU.S. Federal Income Tax Dispute\nOn September 17, 2015, the Company received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (\"Notice\") from the IRS for the tax years 2007 through 2009, after a five-year audit. In the\nNotice, the IRS claims that the Company's United States taxable income should be increased by an amount that creates a potential additional federal income tax liability of\napproximately $3.3 billion for the period, plus interest. No penalties were asserted in the Notice. The disputed amounts largely relate to a transfer pricing matter involving the\nappropriate amount of taxable income the Company should report in the United States in connection with its licensing of intangible property to certain related foreign licensees\nregarding the manufacturing, distribution, sale, marketing and promotion of products in overseas markets.\nDuring the 2007-2009 audit period, the Company followed the same transfer pricing methodology for these licenses that had consistently been followed since the methodology\nwas agreed with the IRS in a 1996 closing agreement that applied back to 1987. The closing agreement provided prospective penalty protection as long as the Company\nfollowed the prescribed methodology and material facts and circumstances and relevant federal tax law have not changed. On February 11, 2016, the IRS notified the Company,\nwithout further explanation, that the IRS had determined that material facts and circumstances and relevant federal tax law had changed permitting it to assert penalties. The\nCompany does not agree with this determination. The Company's compliance with the closing agreement was audited and confirmed by the IRS in five successive audit cycles\ncovering the subsequent 11 years through 2006, with the last audit concluding as recently as 2009.\nThe Notice represents a repudiation of the methodology previously adopted in the 1996 closing agreement. The IRS designated the matter for litigation on October 15, 2015. To\nthe extent the matter remains designated, the Company will be prevented from pursuing any administrative settlement at IRS Appeals or under the IRS Advance Pricing and\nMutual Agreement Program.\nThe Company firmly believes that the IRS' claims are without merit and plans to pursue all available administrative and judicial remedies necessary to resolve this matter. To\nthat end, the Company filed a petition in the U.S. Tax Court on December 14, 2015, and the IRS filed its answer on February 12, 2016. On October 4, 2017, the IRS filed an\namended answer to the Company's petition in which it increased its transfer pricing adjustment by $385 million resulting in an additional tax adjustment of $135 million.

Beverages bearing trademarks owned by or licensed to us\naccount for more than 1.9 billion of the approximately 60 billion servings of all beverages consumed worldwide every day.\nWe believe our success depends on our ability to connect with consumers by providing them with a wide variety of beverage choices to meet their desires, needs and lifestyle\nchoices.

The financial health and success of our bottling partners are critical\ncomponents of the Company's success.

Across the Coca-Cola system, we are mobilizing our assets in marketing and in community outreach to increase awareness and spur action.\n31\n\n\nWater Quality and Quantity\nWater quality and quantity is an issue that requires our Company's sustained attention and collaboration with other companies, suppliers, governments, nongovernmental\norganizations and communities where we operate. Water is a main ingredient in substantially all of our products, is vital to the production of the agricultural ingredients on\nwhich our business relies and is needed in our manufacturing process. It also is critical to the prosperity of the communities we serve. Water is a limited natural resource facing\nunprecedented challenges from overexploitation, increased food demand, increasing pollution, poor management and the effects of climate change.\nOur Company regularly assesses the specific water-related risks that we and many of our bottling partners face and has implemented a formal water risk management program.\nMitigation of water risk forms the basis of our water stewardship strategic framework. This strategy is executed at the local level where we operate and includes the following\nelements: water use efficiency and wastewater treatment in manufacturing operations; shared watershed protection efforts; engaging local communities; and addressing water\nresource management in our agricultural ingredient supply chain. Such efforts are conducted in collaboration and partnership with others and are intended to help address local\nneeds. Many of these efforts help us in achieving our goal of replenishing the water that we and our bottling partners source and use in our finished products. We are also\ncollaborating with other companies, governments, nongovernmental organizations and communities to advocate for needed water policy reforms and action to protect water\navailability and quality around the world.\nThrough these integrated programs, we believe that our Company can leverage the water-related knowledge we have developed in the communities we serve — through source\nwater availability assessments and planning, water resource management, water treatment, wastewater treatment systems and models for working with communities and\npartners in addressing water and sanitation needs. As demand for water continues to increase around the world, we expect continued action on our part to help with the\nsuccessful long-term stewardship of this critical natural resource, both for our business and the communities we serve.\nEvolving Consumer Preferences\nWe are impacted by shifting consumer demographics and needs, on-the-go lifestyles, aging populations and consu",

We are also committed to continuing to expand the variety of choices we provide to consumers to meet their ever-changing needs, desires and lifestyles.\nIncreased Competition and Capabilities in the Marketplace\nOur Company is facing strong competition from some well-established global companies and numerous regional and local companies. We must continuously strengthen our\ncapabilities in marketing and innovation in order to maintain our brand loyalty and market share while we selectively expand into other profitable categories of the nonalcoholic\nbeverage segment of the commercial beverage industry.\nProduct Safety and Quality\nAs the world's largest beverage company, we strive to meet the highest standards in both product safety and product quality.

The Coca-Cola system works every day to share safe and refreshing beverages with the world. We\nhave rigorous product and ingredient safety and quality standards designed to ensure safety and quality in each of our products, and we drive innovation that provides new\nbeverage options to meet consumers' evolving needs and preferences.

We stay current with new regulations,\nindustry best practices and marketplace conditions and engage with standard-setting and industry organizations. Additionally, we manufacture and distribute our products\naccording to strict policies, requirements and specifications set forth in an integrated quality management program that continually measures all operations within the Coca-Cola\nsystem against the same stringent standards.

While our estimates and assumptions are based on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately differ\nfrom these estimates and assumptions. For a discussion of the Company's significant accounting policies, refer to Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nOur Company consolidates all entities that we control by ownership of a majority voting interest. Additionally, there are situations in which consolidation is required even\nthough the usual condition of consolidation (ownership of a majority voting interest) does ",

Generally, this occurs when an entity holds an interest in another business\nenterprise that was achieved through arrangements that do not involve voting interests, which results in a disproportionate relationship between such entity's voting interests in,\nand its exposure to the economic risks and potential rewards of, the other business enterprise. This disproportionate relationship results in what is known as a variable interest,\nand the entity in which we have the variable interest is referred to as a \"VIE.\" An enterprise must consolidate a VIE if it is determined to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE.\nThe primary beneficiary has both (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance, and (2) the obligation to\nabsorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.\nOur Company holds interests in certain VIEs, primarily bottling and container manufacturing operations, for which we were not determined to be the primary beneficiary. Our\nvariable interests in these VIEs primarily relate to equity investments, profit guarantees or subordinated financial support. Refer to Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements. Although these financial arrangements resulted in our holding variable interests in these entities, they did not empower us to direct the activities of the VIEs that\nmost significantly impact the VIEs' economic performance. Our Company's investments, plus any loans and guarantees, and other subordinated financial support related to these\nVIEs totaled $4,523 million and $3,709 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, representing our maximum exposures to loss. The Company's investments,\n33\n\n\nplus any loans and guarantees, related to these VIEs were not individually significant to the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn addition, our Company holds interests in certain VIEs, primarily bottling and container manufacturing operations, for which we were determined to be the primary\nbeneficiary. As a result, we have consolidated these entities. Our Company's investments, plus any loans and guarantees, related to these VIEs totaled $1 million and $203\nmillion as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, representing our maximum exposures to loss. The assets and liabilities of VIEs for which we are the primary\nbeneficiary were not significant to the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nCreditors of our VIEs do not have recourse against the general credit of the Company, regardless of whether they are accounted for as consolidated entities.\nWe use the equity method to account for investments in companies if our investment provides us with the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial\npolicies of the investee.

Our judgment regarding the\nlevel of influence over each equity method investee includes considering key factors such as our ownership interest, representation on the board of directors, participation in\npolicy-making decisions and material intercompany transactions.\nWe eliminate from our financial results all significant intercompany transactions, including the intercompany transactions with consolidated VIEs and the intercompany portion\nof transactions with equity method investees.\nRecoverability of Current and Noncurrent Assets\nOur Company faces many uncertainties and risks related to various economic, political and regulatory environments in the countries in which we operate, particularly in\ndeveloping and emerging markets. Refer to the heading \"Our Business — Challenges and Risks\" above and \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" in Part I of this report. As a result,\nmanagement must make numerous assumptions which involve a significant amount of judgment when completing recoverability and impairment tests of current and noncurrent\nassets in various regions around the world.\nWe perform recoverability and impairment tests of current and noncurrent assets in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For certain assets, recoverability and/or impairment tests are\nrequired only when conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. For other assets, impairment tests are required at least annually, or more frequently\nif events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired.\nOur equity method investees also perform such recoverability and/or impairment tests. If an impairment charge is recorded by one of our equity method investees, the Company\nrecords its proportionate share of such charge as a reduction of equity income (loss) — net in our consolidated statement of income. However, the actual amount we record with\nrespect to our proportionate share of such charges may be impacted by items such as basis differences, deferred taxes and deferred gains.\nManagement's assessments of the recoverability and impairment tests of noncurrent assets involve critical accounting estimates. These estimates require significant management\njudgment, include inherent uncertainties and are often interdependent; therefore, they do not change in isolation. Factors that management must estimate include, among others,\nthe economic life of the asset, sales volume, pricing, cost of raw materials, delivery costs, inflation, cost of capital, marketing spending, foreign currency exchange rates, tax\nrates, capital spending and proceeds from the sale of assets. These factors are even more difficult to predict when global financial markets are highly volatile. The estimates we\nuse when assessing the recoverability of current and noncurrent assets are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. When performing impairment tests, we estimate\nthe fair values of the assets using management's best assumptions, which we believe would be consistent wit",

The variability of these factors depends on a number of conditions, including uncertainty about\nfuture events, and thus our accounting estimates may change from period to period. If other assumptions and estimates had been used when these tests were performed,\nimpairment charges could have resulted. As mentioned above, these factors do not change in isolation and, therefore, we do not believe it is practicable or meaningful to present\nthe impact of changing a single factor. Furthermore, if management uses different assumptions or if different conditions occur in future periods, future impairment charges could\nresult. Refer to the heading \"Operations Review\" below for additional information related to our present business environment. Certain factors discussed above are impacted by\nour current business environment and are discussed throughout this report, as appropriate.\nInvestments in Equity and Debt Securities\nThe carrying values of our investments in equity securities are determined using the equity method, the cost method or the fair value method. We account for investments in\ncompanies that we do not control or account for under the equity method either at fair value or under the cost method, as applicable. Investments in equity securities, other than\ninvestments accounted for under the equity method, are carried at fair value if the fair value of the security is readily determinable. Equity investments carried at\n34\n\n\nfair value are classified as either trading or available-for-sale securities. Our investments in debt securities are carried at either amortized cost or fair value. Investments in debt\nsecurities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost and classified as held-to-maturity. Investments in debt securities\nthat are not classified as held-to-maturity are carried at fair value and classified as either trading or available-for-sale. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading\nsecurities and realized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are included in net income. Unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred taxes, on available-for-sale\nsecurities are included in our consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (\"AOCI\"), except for the change in fair value\nattributable to the currency risk being hedged, if applicable, which is included in net income.

When\nsuch events or changes occur, we evaluate the fair value compared to our cost basis in the investment. We also perform this evaluation every reporting period for each\ninvestment for which our cost basis has exceeded the fair value. The fair values of most of our Company's investments in publicly traded companies are often readily available\nbased on quoted market prices. For investments in nonpublicly traded companies, management's assessment of fair value is based on valuation methodologies including\ndiscounted cash flows, estimates of sales proceeds and appraisals, as appropriate. We consider the assumptions that we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use\nin evaluating estimated future cash flows when employing the discounted cash flow or estimates of sales proceeds valuation methodologies. The ability to accurately predict\nfuture cash flows, especially in emerging and developing markets, may impact the determination of fair value.\nIn the event the fair value of an investment declines below our cost basis, management is required to determine if the decline in fair value is other than temporary. If\nmanagement determines the decline is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded. Management's assessment as to the nature of a decline in fair value is based on,\namong other things, the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our cost basis; the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer;\nand our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.

Otherwise, the Company does not need to perform any\nfurther assessment.\nIntangible assets acquired in recent transactions are naturally more susceptible to impairment, primarily due to the fact that they are recorded at fair value based on recent\noperating plans and macroeconomic conditions present at the time of acquisition. Consequently, if operating results and/or macroeconomic conditions deteriorate shortly after\nan acquisition, it could result in the impairment of the acquired assets. A deterioration of macroeconomic conditions may not only negatively impact the estimated operating\ncash flows used in our cash flow models but may also negatively impact other assumptions used in our analyses, including, but not limited to, the estimated cost of capital\nand/or discount rates. Additionally, as discussed above, in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we are required to ensure that assumptions used to determine fair value in our analyses\nare consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical marketplace participant would use. As a result, the cost of capital and/or discount rates used in our analyses may increase or\ndecrease based on market conditions and trends, regardless of whether our Company's actual cost of capital has changed.

Generally, each Company-owned or consolidated bottling operation within our Bottling Investments\noperating segment is its own reporting unit. Goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit or units that benefit from the synergies arising from each business combination.\nIn order to test for goodwill impairment, the Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value,\nincluding goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is lower than its carrying amount, goodwill is written down for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the\nfair value.

Our pension plan investment objective is to ensure all\nof our plans have sufficient funds to meet their benefit obligations when they become due. As a result, the Company periodically revises asset allocations, where appropriate, to\nimprove returns and manage risk. The weighted-average expected long-term rate of return used to calculate our pension expense was 8.00 percent and 8.25 percent in 2017 and\n2016, respectively.\nIn 2017, the Company's total pension expense related to defined benefit plans was $368 million, which included $28 million of net periodic benefit cost and $340 million of\nsettlement charges, curtailment charges and special termination benefit costs. In 2018, we expect our total pension expense to be approximately $17 million, which includes\n$108 million of net periodic benefit income and $125 million of estimated settlement charges and special termination benefit costs expected to be incurred. The decrease in 2018\nexpected net periodic benefit cost is primarily due to 2017 North America refranchising activities, which decreased the size of the active workforce and, therefore, the number of\nemployees earning pension benefits. Favorable asset performance in 2017 further decreased expected 2018 expense, although this was partially offset by a decrease in the\nweighted-average discount rate at December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016. The estimated impact of a 50 basis-point decrease in the discount rate on our 2018 net\nperiodic benefit cost would be an increase to our pension expense of $25 million. Additionally, the estimated impact of a 50 basis-point decrease in the expected long-term rate\nof return on plan assets on our 2018 net periodic benefit cost would be an increase to our pension expense of $29 million.\nThe sensitivity information provided above is based only on changes to the actuarial assumptions used for our U.S. pension plans. As of December 31, 2017, the Company's\nprimary U.S. plan represented 64 percent and 65 percent of the Company's consolidated projected pension benefit obligation and pension assets, respectively.

Refer to Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery of products has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is\nreasonably assured. For our Company, this generally means that we recognize revenue when title to our products is transferred to our bottling partners, resellers or other\ncustomers. Title usually transfers upon shipment to or receipt at our customers' locations, as determined by the specific sales terms of each transaction. Our sales terms do not\nallow for a right of return except for matters related to any manufacturing defects on our part.\nOur customers can earn certain incentives which are included in deductions from revenue, a component of net operating revenues in our consolidated statements of income.\nThese incentives include, but are not limited to, cash discounts, funds for promotional and marketing activities, volume-based incentive programs and support for infrastructure\nprograms. Refer to Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The aggregate deductions from revenue recorded by the Company in relation to these programs,\nincluding amortization expense on infrastructure programs, were $6.2 billion, $6.6 billion and $6.8 billion in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. In preparing the financial\nstatements, management must make estimates related to the contractual terms, customer performance and sales volume to determine the total amounts recorded as deductions\nfrom revenue. Management also considers past results in making such estimates. The actual amounts ultimately paid may be different from our estimates. Such differences are\nrecorded once they have been determined and have historically not been\n39\n\n\nsignificant. The Company will adopt ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and its amendments on January 1, 2018. Adoption of this standard will result in a\nchange in our revenue recognition policy.

Significant judgment is required in determining our\nannual tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions.

The closing agreement provided prospective penalty protection as long as the Company\nfollowed the prescribed methodology and material facts and circumstances and relevant federal tax law have not changed. On February 11, 2016, the IRS notified the Company,\nwithout further explanation, that the IRS had determined that material facts and circumstances and relevant federal tax law had changed permitting it to assert penalties. The\nCompany does not agree with this determination. The Company's compliance with the closing agreement was audited and confirmed by the IRS in five successive audit cycles\ncovering the subsequent 11 years through 2006, with the last audit concluding as recently as 2009.\nThe Notice represents a repudiation of the methodology previously adopted in the 1996 closing agreement. The IRS designated the matter for litigation on October 15, 2015. To\nthe extent the matter remains designated, the Company will be prevented from pursuing any administrative settlement at IRS Appeals or under the IRS Advance Pricing and\nMutual Agreement Program.\nThe Company firmly believes that the IRS' claims are without merit and plans to pursue all available administrative and judicial remedies necessary to resolve this matter.

Based on\nthe evaluation of all available information, the Company recognizes future tax benefits, such as net operating loss carryforwards, to the extent that realizing these benefits is\nconsidered more likely than not.\nWe evaluate our ability to realize the tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets by analyzing our forecasted taxable income using both historical and projected future\noperating results; the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences; taxable income in prior carryback years (if permitted); and the availability of tax planning strategies. A\nvaluation allowance is required to be established unless management determines that it is more likely than not that the Company will ultimately realize the tax benefit\nassociated with a deferred tax asset. As of December 31, 2017, the Company's valuation allowances on deferred tax assets were $501 million and were primarily related to\nuncertainties regarding the future realization of recorded tax benefits on tax loss carryforwards generated in various jurisdictions. Current evidence does not suggest we will\nrealize sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character within the carryforward period to allow us to realize these deferred tax benefits. If we were to identify and\nimplement tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or generate sufficient income of the appropriate character in these jurisdictions in the future, it could lead\nto the reversal of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense.

Among other things, the Tax Reform Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35.0 percent to 21.0\npercent effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, transitions the U.S. method of taxation from a worldwide tax system to a modified territorial system and\nrequires companies to pay a one-time transition tax over a period of eight years on the mandatory deemed repatriation of prescribed foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017.\nAt December 31, 2017, we have not yet finalized the calculations of the tax effects of the Tax Reform Act; however, we have calculated a reasonable estimate of the effects on\nour year end income tax provision in accordance with our current understanding of the Tax Reform Act and the available guidance. As a result, the Company recognized a net\nprovisional tax charge in the amount of $3.6 billion in 2017, which is included as a component of income taxes from continuing operations on our consolidated statement of\nincome. We will continue to refine our calculations as additional analysis is completed. In addition, our estimates may also be affected as we gain a more thorough\nunderstanding of the Tax Reform Act as a result of potential legislative or regulatory provisions or interpretive guidance.\nThe one-time transition tax is based on our total accumulated post-1986 prescribed foreign earnings and profits (\"E&P\") estimated to be $42 billion, the majority of which was\npreviously considered to be indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, no U.S. federal and state income taxes had been provided. We recorded a provisional tax amount of $4.6\nbillion as a reasonable estimate for our one-time transition tax liability and a $0.6 billion provisional deferred tax for the related withholding taxes and state income taxes.\nBecause of the complexities of the Tax Reform Act, we are still finalizing our calculation of the total accumulated post-1986 prescribed E&P for the applicable foreign entities.\nFurther, the transition tax is based in part on the amount of those earnings held in cash and other specified assets. This amount may change when we finalize the calculation of\npost-1986 prescribed foreign E&P and finalize the amounts held in cash or other specified assets.

The ownership structure of our bottling partners impacts the timing of\nrecognizing concentrate revenue and concentrate sales volume. When we sell concentrates or syrups to our consolidated bottling partners, we are not able to recognize the\nconcentrate revenue or concentrate sales volume until the bottling partner has sold finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups to a third party or\nindependent customer. When we sell concentrates or syrups to our unconsolidated bottling partners, we recognize the concentrate revenue and concentrate sales volume when\nthe concentrates or syrups are sold to the bottling partner. The subsequent sale of the finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups to a customer does not\nimpact the timing of recognizing the concentrate revenue or concentrate sales volume. When we account for an unconsolidated bottling partner as an equity method investment,\nwe eliminate the intercompany profit related to these transactions until the equity method investee has sold finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups to a\nthird party or independent customer.\n \nBeverage Volume\nWe measure the volume of Company beverage products sold in two ways: (1) unit cases of finished products and (2) concentrate sales. As used in this report, \"unit case\" means\na unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings); and \"unit case volume\" means the number of unit cases (or unit case\nequivalents) of Company beverage products directly or indirectly sold by the Company and its bottling partners to customers. Unit case volume primarily consists of beverage\nproducts bearing Company trademarks. Also included in unit case volume are certain products licensed to, or distributed by, our Company, and brands owned by Coca-Cola\nsystem bottlers for which our Company provides marketing support and from the sale of which we derive economic benefit. In addition, unit case volume includes sales by\ncertain joint ventures in which the Company has an equity interest. We believe unit case volume is one of the measures of the underlying strength of the Coca-Cola system\nbecause it measures trends at the consumer level. The unit case volume numbers used in this report are derived based on estimates received by the Company from its bottling\npartners and distributors. Concentrate sales volume represents the amount of concentrates, syrups, beverage bases, source waters, and powders/minerals (in all instances\nexpressed in equivalent unit cases) sold by, or used in finished beverages sold by, the Company to its bottling partners or other customers. Unit case volume and concentrate\nsales volume growth rates are not necessarily equal during any given period.

Additionally, advertising expenses during 2017 decreased 1 percent as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The decrease in other\noperating expenses during 2017 reflects savings from our productivity and reinvestment initiatives and a reduction in net periodic benefit cost. Foreign currency exchange rate\nfluctuations have a more significant impact on both advertising and other operating expenses as compared to our selling and distribution expenses since they are generally\ntransacted in local currency.

A significant portion of these foreign earnings was previously considered to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign jurisdictions where the\nCompany has made, and will continue to make, substantial investments to support the ongoing development and growth of our international operations. Accordingly, no U.S.\nfederal and state income taxes were previously provided on the portion of our foreign earnings that was considered to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign jurisdictions.

The Tax Reform Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35.0 percent to 21.0 percent effective for tax\nyears beginning after December 31, 2017, transitions the U.S. method of taxation from a worldwide tax system to a modified territorial system and requires companies to pay a\none-time transition tax over a period of eight years on the mandatory deemed repatriation of prescribed foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017. As a result, the Company\nrecognized a provisional tax charge related to the one-time transition tax in the amount of $4.6 billion in 2017.

In addition, some rating agencies also consider the financial information of\ncertain bottlers, including CCEP, Coca-Cola Amatil Limited, Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated, Coca-Cola FEMSA and Coca-Cola Hellenic. While the Company has no\nlegal obligation for the debt of these bottlers, the rating agencies believe the strategic importance of the bottlers to the Company's business model provides the Company with an\nincentive to keep these bottlers viable. It is our expectation that the credit rating agencies will continue using this methodology. If our credit ratings were to be downgraded as a\nresult of changes in our capital structure, our major bottlers' financial performance, changes in the credit rating agencies' methodology in assessing our credit strength, or for\nany other reason, our cost of borrowing could increase. Additionally, if certain bottlers' credit ratings were to decline, the Company's equity income could be reduced as a result\nof the potential increase in interest expense for those bottlers.\nWe monitor our financial ratios and, as indicated above, the rating agencies consider these ratios in assessing our credit ratings. Each rating agency employs a different\naggregation methodology and has different thresholds for the various financial ratios. These thresholds are not necessarily permanent, nor are they always fully disclosed to our\nCompany.\nOur global presence and strong capital position give us access to key financial markets around the world, enabling us to raise funds at a low effective cost. This posture, coupled\nwith active management of our mix of short-term and long-term debt and our mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt, results in a lower overall cost of borrowing. Our debt\nmanagement policies, in conjunction with our share repurchase program and investment activity, can result in current liabilities exceeding current assets.\nIssuances and payments of debt included both short-term and long-term financing activities.

These\nguarantees are primarily related to third-party customers, bottlers, vendors and container manufacturing operations and have arisen through the normal course of business. These\nguarantees have various terms, and none of these guarantees was individually significant. The amount represents the maximum potential future payments that we could be\nrequired to make under the guarantees; however, we do not consider it probable that we will be required to satisfy these guarantees. Management has concluded that the\nlikelihood of any significant amounts being paid by our Company under these guarantees is not probable. As of December 31, 2017, we were not directly liable for the debt of\nany unconsolidated entity, and we did not have any retained or contingent interest in assets as defined above.\nOur Company recognizes all derivatives as either assets or liabilities at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets.

In general, we believe that, over time, we will be able to increase prices to counteract the majority of the\ninflationary effects of increasing costs and to generate sufficient cash flows to maintain our productive capability.\n67\n\n\nOverview of Financial Position\nThe following table illustrates the change in the individual line items of the Company's consolidated balance sheet (in millions):\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\nIncrease\n(Decrease)\nPercent Change\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n6,006\n$\n8,555\n$\n(2,549)\n(30)%\nShort-term investments\n9,352\n9,595\n(243)\n(3)\nMarketable securities\n5,317\n4,051\n1,266\n31\nTrade accounts receivable — net\n3,667\n3,856\n(189)\n(5)\nInventories\n2,655\n2,675\n(20)\n(1)\nPrepaid expenses and other assets\n2,000\n2,481\n(481)\n(19)\nAssets held for sale\n219\n2,797\n(2,578)\n(92)\nAssets held for sale — discontinued operations\n7,329\n—\n7,329\n—\nEquity method investments\n20,856\n16,260\n4,596\n28\nOther investments\n1,096\n989\n107\n11\nOther assets\n4,560\n4,248\n312\n7\nProperty, plant and equipment — net\n8,203\n10,635\n(2,432)\n(23)\nTrademarks with indefinite lives\n6,729\n6,097\n632\n10\nBottlers' franchise rights with indefinite lives\n138\n3,676\n(3,538)\n(96)\nGoodwill\n9,401\n10,629\n(1,228)\n(12)\nOther intangible assets\n368\n726\n(358)\n(49)\nTotal assets\n$\n87,896\n$\n87,270\n$\n626\n1 %\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses\n$\n8,748\n$\n9,490\n$\n(742)\n(8)%\nLoans and notes payable\n13,205\n12,498\n707\n6\nCurrent maturities of long-term debt\n3,298\n3,527\n(229)\n(6)\nAccrued income taxes\n410\n307\n103\n34\nLiabilities held for sale\n37\n710\n(673)\n(95)\nLiabilities held for sale — discontinued operations\n1,496\n—\n1,496\n—\nLong-term debt\n31,182\n29,684\n1,498\n5\nOther liabilities\n8,021\n4,081\n3,940\n97\nDeferred income taxes\n2,522\n3,753\n(1,231)\n(33)\nTotal liabilities\n$\n68,919\n$\n64,050\n$\n4,869\n8 %\nNet assets\n$\n18,977\n$\n23,220\n$\n(4,243)\n1 \n(18)%\n1 Includes an increase in net assets of $861 million resulting from foreign currency translation adjustments in various balance sheet line\nitems.\nThe increases (decreases) in the table above include the impact of the following transactions and events:\n• Assets held for sale and liabilities held for sale decreased primarily due to the North America and Chi",

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nOur Company uses derivative financial instruments primarily to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, commodity prices\nand other market risks. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. As a matter of policy, all of our derivative positions are used to reduce risk by\nhedging an underlying economic exposure. Because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure, fluctuations in the value of the\ninstruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying exposure. The Company generally hedges anticipated exposures up to 36 months in\nadvance; however, the majority of our derivative instruments expire within 24 months or less. Virtually all of our derivatives are straightforward over-the-counter instruments\nwith liquid markets.\nWe monitor our exposure to financial market risks using several objective measurement systems, including a sensitivity analysis to measure our exposure to fluctuations in\nforeign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Refer to Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our\nhedging transactions and derivative financial instruments.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rates\nWe manage most of our foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis, which allows us to net certain exposures and take advantage of any natural offsets. In 2017, we\nused 74 functional currencies and generated $20,683 million of our net operating revenues from operations outside the United States; therefore, weaknesses in some currencies\nmight be offset by strengths in other currencies over time.

We use derivative financial instruments to further reduce our net exposure to foreign currency fluctuations.\nOur Company enters into forward exchange contracts and purchases foreign currency options (principally euros and Japanese yen) and collars to hedge certain portions of\nforecasted cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. Additionally, we enter into forward exchange contracts to offset the earnings impact related to foreign currency\nfluctuations on certain monetary assets and liabilities. We also enter into forward exchange contracts as hedges of net investments in foreign operations.\nThe total notional values of our foreign currency derivatives were $13,057 million and $14,464 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. These values include\nderivative instruments that are designated and qualify for hedge accounting as well as economic hedges. The fair value of the contracts that qualify for hedge accounting resulted\nin a net unrealized gain of $22 million as of December 31, 2017. At the end of 2017, we estimate that a 10 percent weakening of the U.S. dollar would have eliminated the net\nunrealized gain and created a net unrealized loss of $253 million. The fair value of the contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting resulted in a net unrealized loss of\n$50 million, and we estimate that a 10 percent weakening of the U.S. dollar would have increased the net unrealized loss to $105 million.\nInterest Rates\nThe Company is subject to interest rate volatility with regard to existing and future issuances of debt. We monitor our mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt as well as our mix\nof short-term debt and long-term debt. From time to time, we enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations.\nBased on the Company's variable-rate debt and derivative instruments outstanding as of December 31, 2017, we estimate that a 1 percentage point increase in interest rates\nwould have increased interest expense by $252 million in 2017. However, this increase in interest expense would have been partially offset by the increase in interest income\nrelated to higher interest rates.\nThe Company is subject to interest rate risk related to its investments in highly liquid securities. These investments are primarily managed by external managers within the\nguidelines of the Company's investment policy. Our policy requires these investments to be investment grade, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of\nprincipal loss. In addition, our policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. We estimate that a 1 percentage point increase in interest rates would result in a $97\nmillion decrease in the fair value of our portfolio of highly liquid securities.\nCommodity Prices\nThe Company is subject to market risk with respect to commodity price fluctuations, principally related to our purchases of sweeteners, metals, juices, PET and fuels.

We\nmanage our exposure to commodity risks primarily through the use of supplier pricing agreements that enable us to establish the purchase prices for certain inputs that are used\nin our manufacturing and distribution business. When deemed appropriate, we use derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to commodity risks. Certain of these\nderivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, but they are effective economic hedges that help the Company mitigate the price risk associated with the purchases of materials\nused in our manufacturing processes and the fuel used to operate our extensive vehicle fleet.\nOpen commodity derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting had notional values of $35 million and $12 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The fair\nvalue of the contracts that qualify for hedge accounting resulted in a net\n69\n\n\nunrealized loss of $5 million. The potential change in fair value of these commodity derivative instruments, assuming a 10 percent decrease in underlying commodity prices,\nwould have increased the net unrealized loss to $6 million.\nOpen commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting had notional values of $357 million and $447 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nThe fair value of the contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting resulted in a net unrealized gain of $20 million. The potential change in fair value of these commodity\nderivative instruments, assuming a 10 percent decrease in underlying commodity prices, would have eliminated the net unrealized gain and created a net unrealized loss of $18\nmillion.\n70\n\n\n \nITEM 8.

We own or license and market more than 500 nonalcoholic beverage brands, which we group into the\nfollowing category clusters: sparkling soft drinks; water, enhanced water and sports drinks; juice, dairy and plant-based beverages; tea and coffee; and energy drinks. We own\nand market four of the world's top five nonalcoholic sparkling soft drink brands: Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Fanta and Sprite. Finished beverage products bearing our trademarks,\nsold in the United States since 1886, are now sold in more than 200 countries.\nWe make our branded beverage products available to consumers throughout the world through our network of Company-owned or -controlled bottling and distribution\noperations, as well as independent bottling partners, distributors, wholesalers and retailers — the world's largest beverage distribution system. Beverages bearing trademarks\nowned by or licensed to us account for more than 1.9 billion of the approximately 60 billion servings of all beverages consumed worldwide every day.\nOur Company markets, manufactures and sells:\n• beverage concentrates, sometimes referred to as \"beverage bases,\" and syrups, including fountain syrups (we refer to this part of our business as our \"concentrate\nbusiness\" or \"concentrate operations\"); and\n• finished sparkling soft drinks and other nonalcoholic beverages (we refer to this part of our business as our \"finished product business\" or \"finished product\noperations\").\nGenerally, finished product operations generate higher net operating revenues but lower gross profit margins than concentrate operations.\nIn our concentrate operations, we typically generate net operating revenues by selling concentrates and syrups to authorized bottling operations (to which we typically refer as\nour \"bottlers\" or our \"bottling partners\"). Our bottling partners either combine the concentrates with sweeteners (depending on the product), still water and/or sparkling water, or\ncombine the syrups with sparkling water to produce finished beverages. The finished beverages are packaged in authorized containers — such as cans and refillable and\nnonrefillable glass and plastic bottles — bearing our trademarks or trademarks licensed to us  and are then sold to retailers directly or, in some cases, through wholesalers or\nother bottlers. Outside the United States, we also sell concentrates for fountain beverages to",

Our finished product operations generate net operating revenues by selling sparkling soft drinks and a variety of other nonalcoholic beverages, including\nwater, enhanced water and sports drinks; juice, dairy and plant-based beverages; tea and coffee; and energy drinks, to retailers or to distributors, wholesalers and bottling\npartners who distribute them to retailers. In addition, in the United States, we manufacture fountain syrups and sell them to fountain retailers, such as restaurants and\nconvenience stores who use the fountain syrups to produce beverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners who resell the\nfountain syrups to fountain retailers. These fountain syrup sales are included in our North America operating segment. We authorize these wholesalers to resell our fountain\nsyrups through nonexclusive appointments that neither restrict us in setting the prices at which we sell fountain syrups to the wholesalers nor restrict the territories in which the\nwholesalers may resell in the United States.\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"U.S. GAAP\"). The\npreparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses\nand the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Although these estimates are based on our knowledge of\ncurrent events and actions we may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately differ from\n77\n\n\nthese estimates and assumptions. Furthermore, when testing assets for impairment in future periods, if management uses different assumptions or if different conditions occur,\nimpairment charges may result.\nCertain amounts in the prior years' consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been revised to conform to the current year presentation.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nOur Company consolidates all entities that we control by ownership of a majority voting interest. Additionally, there are situations in which consolidation is required even\nthough the usual condition of consolidation (ownership of a majority voting interest) does not apply. Gener",

Generally, this occurs when an entity holds an interest in another business\nenterprise that was achieved through arrangements that do not involve voting interests, which results in a disproportionate relationship between such entity's voting interests in,\nand its exposure to the economic risks and potential rewards of, the other business enterprise. This disproportionate relationship results in what is known as a variable interest,\nand the entity in which we have the variable interest is referred to as a \"VIE.\" An enterprise must consolidate a VIE if it is determined to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE.\nThe primary beneficiary has both (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance, and (2) the obligation to\nabsorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.\nOur Company holds interests in certain VIEs, primarily bottling and container manufacturing operations, for which we were not determined to be the primary beneficiary. Our\nvariable interests in these VIEs primarily relate to equity investments, profit guarantees or subordinated financial support. Refer to Note 11. Although these financial\narrangements resulted in our holding variable interests in these entities, they did not empower us to direct the activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact the VIEs'\neconomic performance. Our Company's investments, plus any loans and guarantees, and other subordinated financial support related to these VIEs totaled $4,523 million and\n$3,709 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, representing our maximum exposures to loss. The Company's investments, plus any loans and guarantees,\nrelated to these VIEs were not individually significant to the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn addition, our Company holds interests in certain VIEs, primarily bottling and container manufacturing operations, for which we were determined to be the primary\nbeneficiary. As a result, we have consolidated these entities. Our Company's investments, plus any loans and guarantees, related to these VIEs totaled $1 million and $203\nmillion as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, representing our maximum exposures to loss. The assets and liabilities of VIEs for which we are the primary\nbeneficiary were not significant to the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nCreditors of our VIEs do not have recourse against the general credit of the Company, regardless of whether they are accounted for as consolidated entities.\nWe use the equity method to account for investments in companies if our investment provides us with the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial\npolicies of the investee.

In October 2017, the\nCompany and Anheuser-Busch InBev (\"ABI\") completed the transition of ABI's controlling interest in Coca-Cola Beverages Africa Proprietary Limited (\"CCBA\") to the\nCompany for $3,150 million, resulting in its consolidation. As CCBA met the criteria for held for sale upon consolidation, we have presented the financial position and results\nof operations of CCBA as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery of products has occurred, the sales price charged is fixed or determinable, and\ncollectibility is reasonably assured. For our Company, this generally means that we recognize revenue when title to our products is transferred to our bottling partners, resellers\nor other customers. In particular, title usually transfers upon shipment to or receipt at our customers' locations, as determined by the specific sales terms of the transactions. Our\nsales terms do not allow for a right of return except for matters related to any manufacturing defects on our part.\nDeductions from Revenue\nOur customers can earn certain incentives including, but not limited to, cash discounts, funds for promotional and marketing activities, volume-based incentive programs and\nsupport for infrastructure programs. The costs associated with these incentives are included in deductions from revenue, a component of net operating revenues in our\nconsolidated statements of income. For customer incentives that must be earned, management must make estimates related to the contractual terms, customer performance and\nsales volume to determine the total amounts earned and to be recorded in deductions from revenue. In making these estimates, management considers past results. The actual\namounts ultimately paid may be different from our estimates.\nIn some situations, the Company may determine it to be advantageous to make advance payments to specific customers to fund certain marketing activities intended to generate\nprofitable volume and/or invest in infrastructure programs with our bottlers that are directed at strengthening our bottling system and increasing unit case volume.

All derivatives are carried at fair\nvalue in our consolidated balance sheets in the following line items, as applicable: prepaid expenses and other assets; other assets; accounts payable and accrued expenses; and\nother liabilities.

Repair and maintenance costs that do not improve service potential or extend economic life are expensed as incurred.\nDepreciation is recorded principally by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of our assets, which are reviewed periodically and generally have the following\nranges: buildings and improvements: 40 years or less; and machinery, equipment and vehicle fleet: 20 years or less. Land is not depreciated, and construction in progress is not\ndepreciated until ready for service. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the remaining lease term, including renewals that\nare deemed to be reasonably assured, or the estimated useful life of the improvement. Depreciation is not recorded during the period in which a long-lived asset or disposal\ngroup is classified as held for sale, even if the asset or disposal group continues to generate revenue during the period. Depreciation expense, including the depreciation expense\nof assets under capital lease, totaled $1,131 million, $1,575 million and $1,735 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Refer to Note 7.\n82\n\n\nGoodwill, Trademarks and Other Intangible Assets\nWe classify intangible assets into three categories: (1) intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization, (2) intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to\namortization and (3) goodwill. We determine the useful lives of our identifiable intangible assets after considering the specific facts and circumstances related to each intangible\nasset. Factors we consider when determining useful lives include the contractual term of any agreement related to the asset, the historical performance of the asset, the\nCompany's long-term strategy for using the asset, any laws or other local regulations which could impact the useful life of the asset, and other economic factors, including\ncompetition and specific market conditions. Intangible assets that are deemed to have definite lives are amortized, primarily on a straight-line basis, over their useful lives,\ngenerally ranging from 1 to 20 years.

If the Company concludes that this is the case, it must perform the testing described above. Otherwise, the Company does not need to perform any\nfurther assessment.\nWe perform impairment tests of goodwill at our reporting unit level, which is one level below our operating segments. Our operating segments are primarily based on\ngeographic responsibility, which is consistent with the way management runs our business. Our operating segments are subdivided into smaller geographic regions or territories\nthat we sometimes refer to as \"business units.\" These business units are also our reporting units. The Bottling Investments operating segment includes all Company-owned or\nconsolidated bottling operations, regardless of geographic location. Generally, each Company-owned or consolidated bottling operation within our Bottling Investments\noperating segment is its own reporting unit. Goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit or units that benefit from the synergies arising from each business combination.\nIn order to test for goodwill impairment, the Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value,\nincluding goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is lower than its carrying amount, goodwill is written down for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the\nfair value.

The fair\nvalue of our stock option grants is estimated on the grant date using a Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. The Company recognizes compensation expense on a\nstraight-line basis over the period the grant is earned by the employee, generally four years.\nThe fair value of our restricted stock units, restricted stock and certain performance share units is the quoted market value of the Company's stock on the grant date less the\npresent value of the expected dividends not received during the relevant period. For most performance share units granted beginning in 2014, the Company includes a relative\ntotal shareowner return (\"TSR\") modifier to determine the number of shares earned at the end of the performance period. For these awards, the number of shares earned based\non the certified achievement of the predefined performance criteria will be reduced or increased if the Company's total shareowner return over the performance period relative to\na predefined compensation comparator group of companies falls outside of a defined range. The fair value of performance share units that include the TSR modifier is\ndetermined using a Monte Carlo valuation model.\nIn the period it becomes probable that the minimum performance criteria specified in the performance share award will be achieved, we recognize expense for the proportionate\nshare of the total fair value of the award related to the vesting period that has already lapsed. The remaining fair value of the award is expensed on a straight-line basis over the\nbalance of the vesting period. In the event the Company determines it is no longer probable that we will achieve the minimum performance criteria specified in the award, we\nreverse all of the previously recognized compensation expense in the period such a determination is made. The Company has made a policy election to estimate the number of\nawards that are expected to vest to determine the amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized in earnings. Forfeiture estimates are trued-up through the vesting\ndate, in order to ensure that total compensation expense is recognized only for those awards that ultimately vest.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between\nthe financial reporting basis and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. The tax rate used to determine the deferred tax assets and liabilities is the enacted tax rate for the\nyear and manner in which the differences are expected to reverse.

For purposes of evaluating whether or not a tax position is uncertain, (1) we presume the tax position will be\nexamined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information; (2) the technical merits of a tax position are derived from authorities such as\nlegislation and statutes, legislative intent, regulations, rulings and case law and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position; and (3) each tax position is\nevaluated without consideration of the possibility of offset or aggregation with other tax positions taken. A number of years may elapse before a particular uncertain tax position\nis audited and finally resolved or when a tax assessment is raised. The number of years subject to tax assessments varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that\nhas been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the \"more likely than not\" recognition threshold would be recognized in income tax expense in the first interim period\nwhen the uncertainty disappears under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is \"more likely than not\" to be sustained, (2) the tax position, amount, and/or\ntiming is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired.

The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services equal to the amount\nthat it expects to be entitled to receive for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 also requires additional disclosures about the nature, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash\nflows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments.

This\nbottler was deconsolidated in conjunction with the Coca-Cola Beverages Africa Proprietary Limited transaction discussed further below.\nMonster Beverage Corporation\nIn June 2015, the Company and Monster entered into a long-term strategic relationship in the global energy drink category (\"Monster Transaction\"). As a result of the Monster\nTransaction, (1) the Company purchased newly issued shares of Monster common stock representing approximately 17 percent of the outstanding shares of Monster common\nstock (after giving effect to the new issuance); (2) the Company sold its global energy drink business (including NOS, Full Throttle, Burn, Mother, Play and Power Play, and\nRelentless) to Monster, and the Company acquired Monster's non-energy drink business (including Hansen's Natural Sodas, Peace Tea, Hubert's Lemonade and Hansen's Juice\nProducts); and (3) the parties amended their distribution coordination agreements to expand distribution of Monster products into additional territories pursuant to long-term\nagreements with the Company's existing network of Company-owned or -controlled bottling operations and independent distribution partners. The Company and its bottling\npartners (\"Coca-Cola system\") also became Monster's preferred global distribution partner. The Company made a net cash payment of $2,150 million to Monster, of which $125\nmillion was originally held in escrow, subject to release upon achievement of milestones relating to the transfer of Monster's domestic distribution rights to our distribution\nnetwork. The $125 million originally held in escrow was transferred to Monster in 2017 upon achievement of the related milestones.\nThe Monster Transaction consisted of multiple elements including the purchase of common stock, the acquisition and divestiture of businesses and the expansion of distribution\nterritories. When consideration transferred is not solely in the form of cash, measurement is based on either the cost to the acquiring entity (the fair value of the assets given) or\nthe fair value of the assets acquired, whichever is more clearly evident and, thus, more reliably measurable. As the majority of the consideration\n88\n\n\ntransferred was cash, we believe the fair value of the consideration transferred is more reliably measurable.

These distribution rights are governed by an agreement with an initial term of 20 years, after which it will continue to remain in\neffect unless otherwise terminated by either party, and there are no future costs of renewal.

As these payments are dependent on future sales, they are a form of contingent\nconsideration.

(\"Keurig\") for $1,567 million. In February 2015, the Company purchased an\nadditional 4 percent ownership interest from Credit Suisse Capital LLC under an agreement for a total purchase price of $830 million.

We recorded a loss of $6 million as a result of the exercise price being lower than our carrying value of these shares. As a result of this transaction,\nthe Company's ownership was reduced to 34 percent of the entity's outstanding shares.

These changes in market conditions may adversely impact the Company's financial\nperformance and are referred to as \"market risks.\" When deemed appropriate, our Company uses derivatives as a risk management tool to mitigate the potential impact of\ncertain market risks. The primary market risks managed by the Company through the use of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments are foreign currency exchange\nrate risk, commodity price risk and interest rate risk.\nThe Company uses various types of derivative instruments including, but not limited to, forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, option contracts, collars and swaps.\nForward contracts and commodity futures contracts are agreements to buy or sell a quantity of a currency or commodity at a predetermined future date, and at a predetermined\nrate or price. An option contract is an agreement that conveys the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a quantity of a currency or commodity at a\npredetermined rate or price during a period or at a time in the future. A collar is a strategy that uses a combination of options to limit the range of possible positive or negative\nreturns on an underlying asset or liability to a specific range, or to protect expected future cash flows. To do this, an investor simultaneously buys a put option and sells (writes)\na call option, or alternatively buys a call option and sells (writes) a put option. A swap agreement is a contract between two parties to exchange cash flows based on specified\nunderlying notional amounts, assets and/or indices. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. The Company may also designate certain non-\nderivative instruments, such as our foreign-denominated debt, in hedging relationships.\nAll derivatives are carried at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets, primarily in the following line items, as applicable: prepaid expenses and other assets; other assets;\naccounts payable and accrued expenses; and other liabilities. The carrying values of the derivatives reflect the impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash\ncollateral held or placed\n96\n\n\nwith the same counterparties, as applicable. These master netting agreements allow the Company to net settle positive and negative positions (assets and liabilities) arising from\ndifferent transactions with the same counterparty.\nThe accounting for gains and losses that result from changes in the fair values of derivative instruments depends on wh",

Derivatives can be designated as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign\noperations. The changes in the fair values of derivatives that have been designated and qualify for fair value hedge accounting are recorded in the same line item in our\nconsolidated statement of income as the changes in the fair values of the hedged items attributable to the risk being hedged. The changes in the fair values of derivatives that\nhave been designated and qualify as cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign operations are recorded in AOCI and are reclassified into the line item in our\nconsolidated statement of income in which the hedged items are recorded in the same period the hedged items affect earnings. Due to the high degree of effectiveness between\nthe hedging instruments and the underlying exposures being hedged, fluctuations in the value of the derivative instruments are generally offset by changes in the fair values or\ncash flows of the underlying exposures being hedged. The changes in the fair values of derivatives that were not designated and/or did not qualify as hedging instruments are\nimmediately recognized into earnings.\nFor derivatives that will be accounted for as hedging instruments, the Company formally designates and documents, at inception, the financial instrument as a hedge of a\nspecific underlying exposure, the risk management objective and the strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction. In addition, the Company formally assesses, both at the\ninception and at least quarterly thereafter, whether the financial instruments used in hedging transactions are effective at offsetting changes in either the fair values or cash flows\nof the related underlying exposures. Any ineffective portion of a financial instrument's change in fair value is immediately recognized into earnings.\nThe Company determines the fair values of its derivatives based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current market rates. Refer to Note 16. The notional amounts\nof the derivative financial instruments do not necessarily represent amounts exchanged by the parties and, therefore, are not a direct measure of our exposure to the financial\nrisks described above. The amounts exchanged are calculated by reference to the notional amounts and by other terms of the derivatives, such as interest rates, foreign currency\nexchange rates, commodity rates or other financial indices. The Company does not view the fair values of its derivatives in isolation but rather in relation to the fair values or\ncash flows of the underlying hedged transactions or other exposures.

Refer to Note 16 for the net presentation of the Company's derivative instruments.\n2 Refer to Note 16 for additional information related to the estimated fair\nvalue.\nCredit Risk Associated with Derivatives\nWe have established strict counterparty credit guidelines and enter into transactions only with financial institutions of investment grade or better. We monitor counterparty\nexposures regularly and review any downgrade in credit rating immediately. If a downgrade in the credit rating of a counterparty were to occur, we have provisions requiring\ncollateral for substantially all of our transactions. To mitigate presettlement risk, minimum credit standards become more stringent as the duration of the derivative financial\ninstrument increases. In addition, the Company's master netting agreements reduce credit risk by permitting the Company to net settle for transactions with the same\ncounterparty. To minimize the concentration of credit risk, we enter into derivative transactions with a portfolio of financial institutions. Based on these factors, we consider the\nrisk of counterparty default to be minimal.\nCash Flow Hedging Strategy\nThe Company uses cash flow hedges to minimize the variability in cash flows of assets or liabilities or forecasted transactions caused by fluctuations in foreign currency\nexchange rates, commodity prices or interest rates. The changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in AOCI and are reclassified into the\nline item in our consolidated statement of income in which the hedged items are recorded in the same period the hedged items affect earnings. The changes in fair values of\nhedges that are determined to be ineffective are immediately reclassified from AOCI into earnings. The maximum length of time for which the Company hedges its exposure to\nthe variability in future cash flows is typically three years.\nThe Company maintains a foreign currency cash flow hedging program to reduce the risk that our eventual U.S. dollar net cash inflows from sales outside the United States and\nU.S. dollar net cash outflows from procurement activities will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

Refer to Note 14.\nOn September 17, 2015, the Company received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (\"Notice\") from the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") for the tax years 2007 through 2009,\nafter a five-year audit. In the Notice, the IRS claims that the Company's United States taxable income should be increased by an amount that creates a potential additional\nfederal income tax liability of approximately $3.3 billion for the period, plus interest. No penalties were asserted in the Notice. The disputed amounts largely relate to a transfer\npricing matter involving the appropriate amount of taxable income the Company should report in the United States in connection with its licensing of intangible property to\ncertain related foreign licensees regarding the manufacturing, distribution, sale, marketing and promotion of products in overseas markets.\nDuring the 2007-2009 audit period, the Company followed the same transfer pricing methodology for these licenses that had consistently been followed since the methodology\nwas agreed with the IRS in a 1996 closing agreement that applied back to 1987. The closing agreement provided prospective penalty protection as long as the Company\nfollowed the prescribed methodology and material facts and circumstances and relevant federal tax law have not changed. On February 11, 2016, the IRS notified the Company,\nwithout further explanation, that the IRS had determined that material facts and circumstances and relevant federal tax law had changed permitting it to assert penalties. The\nCompany does not agree with this determination. The Company's compliance with the closing agreement was audited and confirmed by the IRS in five successive audit cycles\ncovering the subsequent 11 years through 2006, with the last audit concluding as recently as 2009.\nThe Notice represents a repudiation of the methodology previously adopted in the 1996 closing agreement. The IRS designated the matter for litigation on October 15, 2015. To\nthe extent the matter remains designated, the Company will be prevented from pursuing any administrative settlement at IRS Appeals or under the IRS Advance Pricing and\nMutual Agreement Program.\nThe Company firmly believes that the IRS' claims are without merit and plans to pursue all available administrative and judicial remedies necessary to resolve this matter. To\nthat end, the Company filed a petition in the U.S. Tax Court on\n110\n\n\nDecember 14, 2015, and the IRS filed its answer on February 12, 2016. On October 4, 2017, the IRS filed an amended answer to the Company's petition in which it increased its\ntransfer pricing adjustment by $385 million resulting in an additional tax adjustment of $135 million.

Our self-insurance reserves totaled $480 million and $527 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nWorkforce (Unaudited)\nWe refer to our employees as \"associates.\" As of December 31, 2017, our Company had approximately 61,800 associates, of which approximately 12,400 associates were\nlocated in the United States. Our Company, through its divisions and subsidiaries, is a party to numerous collective bargaining agreements. As of December 31, 2017,\napproximately 3,700 associates, excluding seasonal hires, in North America were covered by collective bargaining agreements. These agreements typically have terms of three\nyears to five years years. We currently expect that we will be able to renegotiate such agreements on satisfactory terms when they expire. The Company believes that its\nrelations with its associates are generally satisfactory.\nOperating Leases\nThe following table summarizes our minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases with initial or remaining lease terms in excess of one year as of\nDecember 31, 2017 (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\nOperating Lease\nPayments\n2018\n$\n130\n2019\n85\n2020\n69\n2021\n59\n2022\n52\nThereafter\n147\nTotal minimum operating lease payments1\n$\n542\n1 Income associated with sublease arrangements is not\nsignificant.\n \nNOTE 12: STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS\nOur Company grants awards under its stock-based compensation plans to certain employees of the Company.

The 2014 Equity Plan allows for grants of stock options,\nperformance share units, restricted stock units, restricted stock and other specified award types, including cash awards with performance-based vesting criteria. Beginning in\n2015, the 2014 Equity Plan was the primary plan in use for equity awards and performance cash awards. There were no grants made from the 2014 Equity Plan prior to 2015. As\nof December 31, 2017, there were 413.6 million shares available to be granted under the 2014 Equity Plan.

Economic profit and net operating revenues are adjusted for certain items, which are approved and certified by the Audit Committee of the Board of\nDirectors. The purpose of these adjustments is to ensure a consistent year-to-year comparison of the specific performance criteria. In the event the certified results equal the\npredefined performance criteria, the Company will grant the number of shares equal to the target award. In the event the certified results exceed the predefined performance\ncriteria, additional shares up to the maximum award will be granted. In the event the certified results fall below the predefined performance criteria, a reduced number of shares\nwill be granted. If the certified results fall below the threshold award performance level, no shares will be granted. The performance share units granted under this program are\nthen generally subject to a holding period of one year before the shares are released.\nPerformance share units generally do not entitle participants to vote or receive dividends. For most performance share units granted beginning in 2014, the Company includes a\nrelative TSR modifier to determine the number of shares earned at the end of the performance period. For these awards, the number of shares earned based on the certified\nachievement of the predefined performance criteria will be reduced or increased if the Company's total shareowner return over the performance period relative to a predefined\ncompensation comparator group of companies falls outside of a defined range. The fair value of performance share units that include the TSR modifier is determined using a\nMonte Carlo valuation model. For the remaining awards that do not include the TSR modifier, the fair value of the performance share units is the quoted market value of the\nCompany's stock on the grant date less the present value of the expected dividends not received during the relevant period.\nIn the period it becomes probable that the minimum performance criteria specified in the award will be achieved, we recognize expense for the proportionate share of the total\nfair value of the performance share units related to the vesting period that has already lapsed for the shares expected to vest and be released.

We have established asset allocation targets and investment\nguidelines with each investment manager. Our asset allocation targets promote optimal expected return and volatility characteristics given the long-term time horizon for\nfulfilling the obligations of\n116\n\n\nthe plans. Selection of the targeted asset allocation for U.S. plan assets was based upon a review of the expected return and risk characteristics of each asset class, as well as the\ncorrelation of returns among asset classes. Our target allocation is a mix of 42 percent equity investments, 30 percent fixed-income investments and 28 percent alternative\ninvestments. We believe this target allocation will enable us to achieve the following long-term investment objectives:\n(1) optimize the long-term return on plan assets at an acceptable level of\nrisk;\n(2) maintain a broad diversification across asset classes and among investment managers;\nand\n(3) maintain careful control of the risk level within each asset\nclass.\nThe guidelines that have been established with each investment manager provide parameters within which the investment managers agree to operate, including criteria that\ndetermine eligible and ineligible securities, diversification requirements and credit quality standards, where applicable. Unless exceptions have been approved, investment\nmanagers are prohibited from buying or selling commodities, futures or option contracts, as well as from short selling of securities. Additionally, investment managers agree to\nobtain written approval for deviations from stated investment style or guidelines. As of December 31, 2017, no investment manager was responsible for more than 9 percent of\ntotal U.S. plan assets.\nOur target allocation of 42 percent equity investments is composed of 60 percent global equities, 16 percent emerging market equities and 24 percent domestic small- and mid-\ncap equities. Optimal returns through our investments in global equities are achieved through security selection as well as country and sector diversification. Investments in the\ncommon stock of our Company accounted for approximately 4 percent of our total global equities and approximately 2 percent of total U.S. plan assets. Our investments in\nglobal equities are intended to provide diversified exposure to both U.S. and non-U.S. equity markets. Our investments in both emerging market equities and domestic small-\nand mid-cap equities may experience large swings in their market value.

The objective of investing in\nalternative investments is to provide a higher rate of return than that available from publicly traded equity securities. These investments are inherently illiquid and require a\nlong-term perspective in evaluating investment performance.\nInvestment Strategy for Non-U.S. Pension Plans\nAs of December 31, 2017, the long-term target allocation for 73 percent of our international subsidiaries' pension plan assets, primarily certain of our European and Canadian\nplans, is 71 percent equity securities, 10 percent fixed-income securities and 19 percent other investments. The actual allocation for the remaining 27 percent of the Company's\ninternational subsidiaries' plan assets consisted of 55 percent mutual, pooled and commingled funds; 5 percent fixed-income securities; and 40 percent other investments. The\ninvestment strategies for our international subsidiaries' plans differ greatly, and in some instances are influenced by local law. None of our pension plans outside the United\nStates is individually significant for separate disclosure.\nOther Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets\nPlan assets associated with other postretirement benefits primarily represent funding of one of the U.S. postretirement benefit plans through a Voluntary Employee Beneficiary\nAssociation (\"VEBA\"), a tax-qualified trust. The VEBA assets are primarily invested in liquid assets due to the level and timing of expected future benefit payments.\n117\n\n\nThe following table presents total assets for our other postretirement benefit plans (in millions):\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n78\n$\n2\nEquity securities:\n \n \nU.S.-based companies\n96\n116\nInternational-based companies\n8\n8\nFixed-income securities:\n \n \nGovernment bonds\n2\n3\nCorporate bonds and debt securities\n7\n6\nMutual, pooled and commingled funds\n80\n103\nHedge funds/limited partnerships\n8\n9\nReal estate\n5\n4\nOther\n4\n4\nTotal other postretirement benefit plan assets1\n$\n288\n$\n255\n1 Fair value disclosures related to our other postretirement ",

For other non-U.S. plans, we base the discount rate on comparable\nindices within each of the countries. The rate of compensation increase assumption is determined by the Company based upon annual reviews. We review external data and our\nown historical trends for health care costs to determine the health care cost trend rate assumptions.\nEffective January 1, 2016, for benefit plans using the yield curve approach, the Company changed the method used to calculate the service cost and interest cost components of\nnet periodic benefit cost for pension and other postretirement benefit plans and is measuring these components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the\nplans' projected cash flows. The Company believes the new approach provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between\nprojected cash flows and the corresponding spot rates.

In accordance with SAB 118, the Company has determined that the net tax charge of $3.6 billion recorded in connection with the tax effect of the Tax Reform Act is a\nprovisional amount and a reasonable estimate as of December 31, 2017. Additional work is necessary to finalize the calculation for certain income tax effects of the Tax Reform\nAct.

If we were to identify and implement tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or generate sufficient income\nof the appropriate character in these jurisdictions in the future, it could lead to the reversal of these\n124\n\n\nvaluation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense. The Company believes that it will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the\nremaining net deferred tax assets in our consolidated balance sheet.\nIn 2017, the Company recognized a net decrease of $29 million in its valuation allowances. This decrease was primarily due to the reversal of a valuation allowance in a foreign\njurisdiction related to expenses incurred in the normal course of business that were previously determined to be non-deductible. In addition, the decrease in value of certain\ndeferred tax assets and related valuation allowance due to the reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate and changes to deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances on\ncertain equity investments contributed to the net decrease in the valuation allowance.

This includes certain\npricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs.\nRecurring Fair Value Measurements\nIn accordance with U.S. GAAP, certain assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. For our Company, the only assets and liabilities that\nare adjusted to fair value on a recurring basis are investments in equity and debt securities classified as trading or available-for-sale and derivative financial instruments.\nAdditionally, the Company adjusts the carrying value of certain long-term debt as a result of the Company's fair value hedging strategy.\nInvestments in Trading and Available-for-Sale Securities\nThe fair values of our investments in trading and available-for-sale securities using quoted market prices from daily exchange traded markets are based on the closing price as of\nthe balance sheet date and are classified as Level 1. The fair values of our investments in trading and available-for-sale securities classified as Level 2 are priced using quoted\nmarket prices for similar instruments or nonbinding market prices that are corroborated by observable market data. Inputs into these valuation techniques include actual trade\ndata, benchmark yields, broker/dealer quotes and other similar data. These inputs are obtained from quoted market prices, independent pricing vendors or other sources.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe fair values of our futures contracts are primarily determined using quoted contract prices on futures exchange markets. The fair values of these instruments are based on the\nclosing contract price as of the balance sheet date and are classified as Level 1.\nThe fair values of our derivative instruments other than futures are determined using standard valuation models. The significant inputs used in these models are readily available\nin public markets, or can be derived from observable market transactions, and therefore have been classified as Level 2. Inputs used in these standard valuation models for\nderivative instruments other than futures include the applicable exchange rates, forward rates, interest rates, discount rates and commodity prices. The standard valuation model\nfor options also uses implied volatility as an additional input. The discount rates are based on the historical U.S. Deposit or U.S. Treasury rates, and the implied volatility\nspecific to options is based on quoted rates from financial institutions.\nIncluded in the fair value of derivative instruments is an adjustment for nonperformance risk.

This program is focused on the following initiatives: global supply chain optimization; global marketing and innovation effectiveness;\noperating expense leverage and operational excellence; data and information technology systems standardization; and the integration of Old CCE's North American bottling\noperations.\nIn February 2014, the Company announced the expansion of our productivity and reinvestment program to drive incremental productivity that will primarily be redirected into\nincreased media investments. Our incremental productivity goal consists of two relatively equal components. First, we will expand savings through global supply chain\noptimization, data and information technology systems standardization, and resource and cost reallocation. Second, we will increase the effectiveness of our marketing\ninvestments by transforming our marketing and commercial model to redeploy resources into more consumer-facing marketing investments to accelerate growth.\nIn October 2014, the Company announced that we were further expanding our productivity and reinvestment program and extending it through 2019. The expansion of the\nproductivity initiatives will focus on four key areas: restructuring the Company's global supply chain; implementing zero-based work, an evolution of zero-based budget\nprinciples, across the organization; streamlining and simplifying the Company's operating model; and further driving increased discipline and efficiency in direct marketing\ninvestments.\nIn April 2017, the Company announced its plans to transition to a new, more agile operating model to enable growth. Under this operating model, our business units will be\nsupported by an expanded enabling services organization and a corporate center focused on a few strategic initiatives, policy and governance. The expanded enabling services\norganization will focus on both simplifying and standardizing key transactional processes and providing support to business units through global centers of excellence.\nThe Company has incurred total pretax expenses of $3,058 million related to this program since it commenced.
