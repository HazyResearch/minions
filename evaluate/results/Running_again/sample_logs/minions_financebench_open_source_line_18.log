--- Correctness Evaluation ---
Is correct: False
Confidence: 1.00
Reasoning: The ground truth answer is -0.02, which is equivalent to -2% when expressed as a percentage. The predicted answer is -1.53%. Applying a 10% tolerance to the ground truth percentage (-2%), the acceptable range is -1.8% to -2.2%. The predicted answer of -1.53% falls outside this range, so it is incorrect.
