--- Question ---
Does Verizon have a reasonably healthy liquidity profile based on its quick ratio for FY 2022? If the quick ratio is not relevant to measure liquidity, please state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
Verizon's liquidity profile for FY 2022 is not reasonably healthy based on a quick ratio of approximately 0.71.

--- Ground Truth ---
['No. The quick ratio was approximately 0.54 for Verizon. It indicated that Verizon does not have a healthy liquidity profile.']

--- Correctness Evaluation ---
Is correct: False
Confidence: 0.80
Reasoning: The predicted answer states a quick ratio of 0.71, which is outside the 10% tolerance range of the ground truth quick ratio of 0.54 (acceptable range: 0.486 to 0.594). Additionally, both answers agree that Verizon does not have a healthy liquidity profile, but the numerical discrepancy affects the correctness of the predicted answer.
