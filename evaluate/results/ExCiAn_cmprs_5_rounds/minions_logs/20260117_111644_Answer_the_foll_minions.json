According to the details clearly outlined within the P&L statement and the statement of cash flows, what is the FY2015 depreciation and amortization (D&A from cash flow statement) % margin for AMD?\n\n---\n\nPlease provide succinct advice on the critical information we need to extract from the Financial document. Total length: 763107 characters to answer this question. \n\nAlso consider the following constraints:\n- In your response do NOT use numbered lists.\n- Do NOT structure your response as a sequence of steps.\n",
      "output": "To determine the FY2015 depreciation and amortization (D&A) % margin for AMD, focus on extracting specific financial data from the document. First, locate the P&L statement to identify the total revenue for FY2015, as this will serve as the denominator in calculating the D&A % margin. Next, find the statement of cash flows to identify the D&A expense for the same fiscal year. This figure will be the numerator in your calculation. Once you have both the D&A expense and the total revenue, calculate the D&A % margin by dividing the D&A expense by the total revenue and then multiplying by 100 to express it as a percentage. This approach will provide you with the D&A % margin for AMD for FY2015, based solely on the financial document provided."

Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 12 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`.

The principal elements used to measure CPU performance\nare work-per-cycle (or how many instructions are executed per cycle), clock speed (representing the rate at which a CPU’s internal logic operates, measured in units of\ngigahertz, or billions of cycles per second) and power consumption.

As businesses and consumers\nrequire greater performance from their computer systems due to the growth of digital data and increasingly sophisticated software applications, semiconductor companies are\ndesigning and developing multi-core microprocessors, where multiple processor cores are placed on a single die or in a single processor. Multi-core microprocessors offer\nenhanced overall system performance and efficiency because computing tasks can be spread across two or more processing cores, each of which can execute a task at full\nspeed. Multi-core microprocessors can increase performance of a computer system without greatly increasing the total amount of power consumed and the total amount of heat\nemitted. Businesses and consumers also require computer systems with improved power management technology, which helps them to reduce the power consumption of their\ncomputer systems, enable smaller and more portable form factors, and lower total cost of ownership.\nAccelerated Processing Unit (APU) and System-on-Chip (SoC).    Consumers increasingly demand computing devices with improved end-user experience, system\nperformance and energy efficiency. Consumers also continue to demand thinner and lighter mobile devices, with better performance and longer battery life. We believe that a\ncomputing architecture that optimizes the use of its components can provide these improvements.\nAn APU is a processing unit that integrates a CPU and a GPU onto one chip (or one piece of silicon), along with, in some cases, other special-purpose components. This\nintegration enhances system performance by “offloading” selected tasks\n \n3\n\n\n \n \nto the best-suited component (i.e., the CPU or the GPU) to optimize component use, increasing the speed of data flow between the CPU and GPU through shared memory and\nallowing the GPU to function as both a graphics engine and an application accelerator. Having the CPU and GPU on the same chip also typically improves energy efficiency by,\nfor example, eliminating connections between discrete chips.\nA SoC is a type of IC with a CPU, GPU and other components, such as a memory controller and peripheral management, comprising a complete computing system on a\nsingle chip. By combining all of these elements as a SoC, system performance and energy efficiency is improved, similar to an APU.\nHeterogeneous System Architecture (HSA) describes an industry standard that is an overarching design for having combinations of CPU and GPU processor cores\noperate as a unified, integrated engine that shares system responsibilities and resources.

Heterogeneous computing allows for the elevation of the GPU to the same\nlevel of the CPU for memory access, queuing and execution - a true “compute core”.  This capability allows software programmers to develop applications to more fully utilize\nthe capabilities of the graphics compute core.\n \n \nGraphics Processing Unit (GPU). A GPU is a programmable logic chip that renders images, animations and video and is also increasingly being used to handle general\ncomputing tasks. GPUs are located in plug-in cards, as a discrete processor or in a chipset on the motherboard, or in the same chip as the CPU. GPUs perform parallel\noperations on data to render images for the screen and are essential to presenting computer generated images on the screen, decoding and rendering animations and video. The\nmore sophisticated the GPU, the higher the resolution and the faster and smoother the motion. GPUs on stand-alone cards or discrete GPUs on the motherboard typically\ninclude their own memory, while GPUs in the chipset or CPU chip share main memory with the CPU.\n \nIn addition to graphics processing, the parallel operation of GPUs are used on multiple sets of data, increasingly used in vector processor for non-graphics applications\nthat require repetitive computations such as supercomputing, deep neural networks, and various embedded applications.\n \nChipset.    A chipset is a generic term referring to a collection of system level components that manage data flow among a microprocessor or microprocessors, memory\nand peripherals (such as CD ROM drives, DVD drives and USB peripherals). Chipsets perform essential logic functions, balance a system’s performance and provide system\ncontrol and power management functions. Some chipsets have graphics capabilities by including an integrated graphics processor (IGP) within the chipset. A chipset with an\nIGP is known as an IGP chipset. IGP chipsets can offer a lower cost, reduced power alternative to a discrete GPU, and are often also used in smaller form factors. Systems that\nare powered by an APU or by a CPU and discrete GPU combination often do not have a chipset and instead use an AMD Controller Hub chip to perform the functions of a\nchipset. As a result, we believe that either an APU and AMD Controller Hub chip combination or a SoC, which already includes a chipset, will eventually replace the market\nfor IGP chipsets.\nOur x86 Microprocessor and Chipset Products\nOur microprocessors are incorporated into computing platforms, which are a collection of technologies that are designed to work together to provide a more complete\ncomputing solution and to enable and advance the computing components.

Many consumers value a rich visual experience to\nenable a more compelling and immersive experience, and, for these consumers, the PC has evolved from a traditional data processing and communications device to an\nentertainment platform. As a result, visual realism and graphical display capabilities are key product differentiation elements among computing devices. This has led to\nincreasing creation and use of processing-intensive multimedia content for computing devices, including playing games, capturing multimedia content, viewing online videos,\nphoto editing and managing digital content. In turn, these trends have contributed to higher consumer demand for performance graphics solutions and to manufacturers\ndesigning computing devices with these capabilities.\nOur APUs deliver visual processing functionality for value and mainstream PCs by integrating a CPU and a GPU on a single chip, while discrete GPUs (which are also\nknown as dGPUs) offer high performance graphics processing across AMD platforms. AMD Accelerated Parallel Processing or GPGPU (General Purpose GPU) refers to a set\nof advanced hardware and software technologies that enable discrete AMD GPUs, working in concert with the CPU, to accelerate computational tasks beyond traditional CPU\nprocessing by utilizing the vast number of discrete GPU cores while working with the CPU to process information cooperatively.

A server is a computer system that performs services for connected customers as part of a client-server architecture. Many servers are designed to run an\napplication or applications often for extended periods of time with minimal human intervention. Examples of servers include web servers, e-mail servers and print\nservers. These servers can run a variety of applications, including business intelligence, enterprise resource planning, customer relationship management and advanced\nscientific or engineering models to solve advanced computational problems in disciplines ranging from financial modeling to weather forecasting to oil and gas exploration.\nServers are also used in cloud computing, which is a computing model where data, applications and services are delivered over the internet or an intranet. Today’s data centers\nrequire new technologies and configuration models to meet the demand driven by the staggering amount of data that needs to be stored, accessed and managed. Servers must be\nefficient, scalable and adaptable to meet the compute characteristics of new and changing workloads.\nEmbedded.    Embedded products address computing needs in PC-adjacent markets, such as industrial control and automation, digital signage, point-of-sale/self-service\nkiosks, medical imaging, set-top box and casino gaming machines as well as enterprise class telecommunications, networking, security, storage systems and thin clients (which\nare computers that serve as an access device on a network). Typically, our embedded products are used in applications that require high to moderate levels of performance,\nwhere key features may include mobility, relatively low power, small form factor, and 24x7 operations. High-performance graphics are increasingly important in many\nembedded systems. Support for Linux®, Windows® and other operating systems as well as for increasingly sophisticated applications are also critical for some customers. Other\nrequirements may include meeting rigid specifications for industrial temperatures, shock, vibration and reliability. The embedded market has moved from developing\nproprietary, custom designs to leveraging industry-standard instruction set architectures and processors as a way to help reduce costs and speed time to market.\nSemi-Custom.

Intellectual property rights\ninclude copyrights, patents, patent applications, trademarks, trade secrets and maskwork rights. As of December 26, 2015, we had approximately 4,965 patents in the United\nStates and approximately 895 patent applications pending in the United States. In certain cases, we have filed corresponding applications in foreign jurisdictions. Including\nUnited States and foreign matters, we have approximately 10,330 patent matters worldwide consisting of approximately 7,370 issued patents and 2,935 patent applications\npending.

Under the\ncross license agreement, Intel has rights to make semiconductor products for third parties, but the third-party product designs are not licensed as a result of such\nmanufacture. We have rights to perform assembly and testing for third parties but not rights to make semiconductor products for third parties. The term of the cross license\nagreement continues until the expiration of the last to expire of the licensed patents, unless earlier terminated. A party can terminate the cross license agreement or the rights\nand licenses of the other party if the other party materially breaches the cross license agreement and does not correct the noticed material breach within 60 days. Upon such\ntermination, the terminated party’s license rights terminate but the terminating party’s license rights continue, subject to that party’s continued compliance with the terms of the\ncross license agreement. The cross license agreement will automatically terminate if a party undergoes a change of control (as defined in the cross license agreement), and both\nparties’ licenses will terminate.

The complaint purports to assert claims against AMD and certain individual officers for alleged violations of\nSection 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. The plaintiffs seek to represent a proposed class of\nall persons who purchased or otherwise acquired our common stock during the period from April 4, 2011 through October 18, 2012. The complaint seeks damages allegedly\ncaused by alleged materially misleading statements and/or material omissions by us and the individual officers regarding our 32nm technology and “Llano” product, which\nstatements and omissions, the plaintiffs claim, allegedly operated to artificially inflate the price paid for our common stock during the period. The complaint seeks unspecified\ncompensatory damages, attorneys’ fees and costs. On July 7, 2014, we filed a motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ claims. On March 31, 2015, the Court denied the motion to dismiss.\nOn May 14, 2015, we filed our answer to plaintiffs’ corrected amended complaint. The discovery process is ongoing. On September 4, 2015, plaintiffs filed their motion for\nclass certification.

The impact of global macro-economic conditions, especially the volatility in the Greater China region contributed\nto a decrease in demand for our products. Additionally, competitive pressures contributed to an overall challenging year. We also experienced reduced demand from our\nOriginal Equipment Manufacturers (“OEM”) customers in advance of the launch of Microsoft Windows® 10. Net revenue for 2015 was approximately $4.0 billion, a decrease\nof 28% compared to 2014 net revenue of $5.5 billion. The decrease in net revenue from 2014 was due to a 42% decrease in Computing and Graphics segment revenue and an\n8% decrease in Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment revenue. Computing and Graphics segment revenue declined year-over-year primarily due to lower client\nprocessor sales. Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment revenue declined year-over-year primarily due to lower server and embedded revenue and lower game\nconsole royalties, partially offset by higher semi-custom SoC sales. Gross margin, as a percentage of net revenue for 2015, was 27% compared to 33% in 2014. Gross margin in\n2015 was adversely impacted by an inventory write-down of $65 million, which was primarily the result of lower anticipated demand for older-generation APUs and a\ntechnology node transition charge of $33 million. The impact of the write-down accounted for approximately two gross margin percentage points and the technology node\ntransition charge accounted for approximately one gross margin percentage point. Gross margin in 2015 was also adversely impacted by a lower proportion of revenue from\nComputing and Gra",

Operating loss for 2015 was $481 million compared\nto an operating loss of $155 million in 2014. The decline in operating performance in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to a decrease in net revenue and in gross\nmargin as described above.\nDespite the challenging business environment, we made important changes to our business. During 2015, we continued to focus on introducing a more diverse product\nportfolio. As part of our long-term strategy to deliver great products, we introduced a number of new products in 2015 including, our 6\nth Generation AMD A-Series mobile\nprocessors (formerly codenamed “Carrizo”) in a SoC design and introduced a desktop A-series processor, the AMD A10-7870K APU. We also introduced the A8-7670K APU\ndesigned to support Windows® 10, mainstream workloads and online gaming. With respect to our graphics products, we introduced the new AMD Radeon™ R9 Fury X and\nR9 Fury graphics, the AMD Radeon R7 300 and R9 300 series graphics as well as the AMD Radeon M300 series graphics to reinforce our graphics leadership in both power\nefficiency for notebooks and best-in class performance for desktops. We also expanded our AMD FirePro™ server GPU family by introducing the AMD FirePro S9170,\ndesigned for high performance compute (HPC) environments. The AMD FirePro S9170 is based on second-generation AMD Graphics Core Next (GCN) GPU architecture and\na unified scalable GPU optimized for graphics and compute. We announced the AMD FirePro W4300 graphics card designed for Computer-Aided Design (CAD) for both\nsmall and full-size workstations. We also launched the AMD Radeon R9 Nano, a small-form-factor mini-ITX enthusiast graphics card designed to deliver energy efficiency and\nperformance for ultra-high resolutions, improved virtual reality experiences and smoother gameplay.

Accordingly, we changed our accounting for our investment in GF from\nthe equity method to the cost method of accounting and recognized a dilution gain in investee of approximately $492 million. In the fourth quarter of 2011, we identified\nindicators of impairment in GF that were deemed other than temporary. We performed a valuation analysis and recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $209 million. The\ncarrying value of our remaining investment in GF after the impairment charge was $278 million as of December 31, 2011.\nOn March 4, 2012, as partial consideration for certain rights received under a second amendment to the WSA, we transferred to GF all of the remaining capital stock of\nGF that we owned. In addition, as of March 4, 2012, the Funding Agreement was terminated, and we were no longer party to the Shareholders’ Agreement. As a result of these\ntransactions, we no longer owned any GF capital stock as of March 4, 2012.\nGF continues to be a related party of us because Mubadala Development Company PJSC (Mubadala) and Mubadala Tech are affiliated with WCH, our largest\nstockholder.

During the transition period, pricing for\nmicroprocessor and APU products will remain as set forth in the WSA, but our purchase commitments to GF will no longer apply.\nThird Amendment to Wafer Supply Agreement. On December 6, 2012, we entered into a third amendment to the WSA. Pursuant to the third amendment, we modified our\nwafer purchase commitments for the fourth quarter of 2012 made pursuant to the second amendment to the WSA.

Although actual results have historically been\nreasonably consistent with management’s expectations, the actual results may differ from these estimates or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or\nconditions.\nManagement believes the following critical accounting estimates are the most significant to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most difficult,\nsubjective and complex judgments.\nRevenue Allowances. We record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product sales for estimated future price reductions and other customer\nincentives in the same period that the related revenues are recorded. We base these estimates on actual historical sales returns, historical allowances, historical price reductions,\nmarket activity and other known or anticipated trends and factors. These estimates are subject to management’s judgment and actual provisions could be different from our\nestimates and current provisions, resulting in future adjustments to our revenue and operating results.\nInventory Valuation. At each balance sheet date, we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence based on projected sales outlook. This\nevaluation includes analysis of historical sales levels by product and projections of future demand. These projections assist us in determining the carrying value of our\ninventory. In addition, we write off inventories that we consider obsolete. We adjust the remaining specific inventory balances to approximate the lower of our standard\nmanufacturing cost or market value. Among other factors, management considers forecasted demand in relation to the inventory on hand, competitiveness of product offerings,\nmarket conditions and product life cycles when determining obsolescence and market value. If, in any period, we anticipate future demand or market conditions to be less\nfavorable than our previous estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made. This would\nhave a negative impact on our gross margin in that period. If in any period we are able to sell inventories that were not valued or that had been written down in a previous\nperiod, related revenues would be recorded without any offsetting charge to cost of sales, resulting in a net benefit to our gross margin in that period.\nGoodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized,\nbut rather is tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if there are indicators of impairment present.\n \nWe perform an annual goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year.

The implied fair value of a reporting unit is determined through the application of one or more valuation\nmodels common to our industry, including the income, market and cost approaches. While market valuation data for comparable companies is gathered and analyzed, we\nbelieve that there has not been sufficient comparability between the peer groups and the specific reporting units to allow for the derivation of reliable indications of value using\na market approach. Therefore, we have ultimately employed the income approach which requires estimates of present value of estimated future cash flows. Cash flow\nprojections are based on management’s estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins, taking into consideration industry and market condition. The key assumptions\nwe have used to determine the fair value of our reporting units includes projected cash flows for the next 10 years and discount rates ranging from 13% to 35% from 2013 to\n2015. The discount rate used is based on the weighted-average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business-specific characteristics and the\n \n37\n\n\n \n \nuncertainty related to the reporting unit’s ability to execute on the projected cash flows. A variance in the discount rate could have a significant impact on the amount of the\ngoodwill impairment charge recorded, if any.\nEstimating the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions\ninclude revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions and the\ndetermination of appropriate comparable publicly-traded companies. In addition, we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to\nindividual reporting units to determine the carrying amount of each reporting unit.\nBased on the results of our annual analysis of goodwill in 2015, each reporting unit’s fair value exceeded its carrying value, ranging from approximately 17% to\napproximately 196%. The Computing and Graphics reporting unit had the lowest excess of fair value over carrying value at 17%, however there is no goodwill within this\nreporting unit. In estimating the fair value of our reporting units, we took into consideration the challenging industry and market trends that existed as of September 27, 2015,\nthe date of the annual goodwill impairment test for each respective reporting unit.\nBased on the results of our annual goodwill impairment analysis in 2014, we determined that the carrying value of the Computing and Graphics reporting unit exceeded\nits estimated fair value and accordingly an impairment charge of $233 million was recorded, which represented the entire goodwill ",

Potential events or circumstance that could reasonably be\nexpected to negatively affect the key assumptions we used in estimating the fair value of our reporting units include adverse changes in our industry, increased competition, an\ninability to successfully introduce new products in the marketplace or to achieve internal forecasts, and a decline in our stock price. If the estimated fair value of our reporting\nunits declines due to any of these factors, we may be required to record future goodwill impairment.\n \nIncome Taxes. In determining taxable income for financial statement reporting purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments\nare applied in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the\nrecognition of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement reporting purposes.\nWe must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our charge to income tax expense, in the\nform of a valuation allowance, for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We consider past performance, future expected taxable income and\nprudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance.\nIn addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our\nuncertain tax positions by the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing authority.

The occurrence of a default under any of these\nborrowing arrangements would permit the\n \n50\n\n\n \n \napplicable note holders or the lenders under the Secured Revolving Line of Credit to declare all amounts outstanding under those borrowing arrangements to be immediately\ndue and payable.\nOther Long-Term Liabilities\nOther long-term liabilities in the contractual obligations table above primarily consisted of $40 million of payments due under certain software and technology licenses\nthat will be paid through 2018.\nOther long-term liabilities in the contractual obligations table above exclude amounts recorded on our consolidated balance sheet that do not require us to make cash\npayments, which, as of December 26, 2015, primarily consisted of $18 million of deferred gains resulting from certain real estate transactions that occurred in Sunnyvale,\nCalifornia in 1998, in Markham, Ontario, Canada in 2015 and 2008 and in",

Accruals related to facility consolidation and site closure costs under our\nrestructuring plans of $7 million, deferred rent related to our facilities in Sunnyvale, California of $6 million and operating lease accruals of $5 million are excluded from other\nlong-term liabilities in the contractual obligations table above as they are included in the operating leases obligations. Also excluded from other long-term liabilities in the\ncontractual obligations table above are $4 million of environmental reserves and $4 million of non-current unrecognized tax benefits, which represent potential cash payments\nthat could be payable by us upon settlements with the related authorities. We have not included these amounts in the contractual obligations table above because we cannot\nmake reasonably reliable estimates regarding the timing of the settlements with the related authorities, if any.\nCapital Lease Obligations\nWe terminated our capital lease obligations and entered into a non-cancelable operating lease agreement related to one of our facilities in Markham, Ontario, Canada\nduring 2015. As of December 26, 2015, we did not have any capital lease obligations outstanding.\nOperating Leases\nWe lease certain of our facilities, and in some jurisdictions, we lease the land on which these facilities are built under non-cancelable lease agreements that expire at\nvarious dates through 2028. We lease certain manufacturing and office equipment for terms ranging from one to five years. Total future non-cancelable lease obligations as of\nDecember 26, 2015 were $306 million, including approximately $251 million of future lease payments and estimated operating costs related to real estate transactions that\noccurred in Austin, Texas, Sunnyvale, California, Markham, Canada and Singapore.\nPurchase Obligations\nOur purchase obligations primarily include our obligations to purchase wafers and substrates from third parties, excluding our wafer purchase commitments to GF under\nthe WSA. As of December 26, 2015, total non-cancelable purchase obligations were $319 million.\nObligations to GF\nObligations to GF represent all of our expected cash payments to GF based on wafer receipts and research and development activities. As of December 26, 2015, purchase\nobligations for fiscal 2016 were approximately $248 million, of which amount wafers and research and development activities of approximately $185 million were received by\nDecember 31, 2015.

As of December 26, 2015,\nour investment portfolio consisted primarily of commercial paper. These investments were highly liquid. Due to the relatively short, weighted-average maturity of our\ninvestment portfolio and the current low interest rate environment, our exposure to interest rate risk is minimal.\nAs of December 26, 2015, the majority of our outstanding debt had fixed interest rates. Consequently, our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates on reported\ninterest expense and corresponding cash flows is minimal.\nWe will continue to monitor our exposure to interest rate risk.\nDefault Risk. We mitigate default risk in our investment portfolio by investing in only high credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond\nto a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. Our portfolio includes investments in debt and marketable equity securities with active\nsecondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity. We are averse to principal loss and strive to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk.\nWe actively monitor market conditions and developments specific to the securities and security classes in which we invest. We believe that we take a conservative\napproach to investing our funds in that we invest only in highly-rated debt securities with relatively short maturities and do not invest in securities we believe involve a higher\ndegree of risk. As of December 26, 2015, substantially all of our investments in debt securities were A rated by at least one of the rating agencies. While we believe we take\nprudent measures to mitigate investment related risks, such risks cannot be fully eliminated as there are circumstances outside of our control.\nThere were no sales of available-for-sale securities during 2015.\nThe following table presents the cost basis, fair value and related weighted-average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio and debt obligations as\nof December 26, 2015:\n \n \n2016\n \n2017\n \n2018\n \n2019\n \n2020\n \n2021 and\nthereafter\n \nTotal\n \n2015\n \nFair Value\n \n(In millions, except for percentages)\nInvestment Portfolio\n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \nCash equivalents:\n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \nFixed rate amounts\n$\n376 \n $\n— \n $\n— \n $\n— \n $\n— \n $\n— \n $\n376 \n $\n376 \nWeighted-average rate\n0.27%  \n— \n \n— \n \n— \n \n— \n \n— \n \n0.27%  \n0.27%\nTotal Investment Portfolio\n$\n376 \n $\n— \n $\n— \n $\n— \n $\n— \n $\n— \n $\n376 \n $\n376 \nDebt Obligations\n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \nFixed rate amounts\n$\n— \n $\n— \n $\n— \n $\n600 \n $\n450 \n $\n975 \n $\n2,025 \n $\n1,372 \nWeighted-average effective\ninterest rate\n—%  \n—%  \n—%  \n6.75%  \n7.75%  \n7.24%  \n6.88%  \n10.64%\nVariable rate amounts\n$\n230 \n $\n— \n $\n— \n $\n— \n $\n— \n $\n— \n $\n230 \n $\n230 \nWeighted-average effective\ninterest rate\n4.00%  \n—%  \n—%  \n—% ",

As a result of our foreign operations, we incur costs and we carry assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies, while sales of\nproducts are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars.\nWe maintain a foreign currency hedging strategy, which uses derivative financial instruments to mitigate the risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange\nrates. This strategy takes into consideration all of our exposures. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\nIn applying our strategy, from time to time, we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted expenses denominated in foreign currencies. We\ndesignate these contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted expenses, to the extent eligible under the accounting rules, and evaluate hedge effectiveness prospectively and\nretrospectively. As such, the effective portion of the gain or loss on these contracts is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and\nreclassified to earnings in the same line item as the associated forecasted transaction and in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Any\nineffective portion is immediately recorded in earnings.\n \n52\n\n\n \n \nWe also use, from time to time, foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge recognized foreign currency exposures on the balance sheets of various\nsubsidiaries. We do not designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments. Accordingly, the gain or loss associated with these contracts is immediately recorded in\nearnings.\nThe following table provides information about our foreign currency forward contracts as of December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014.

The Company uses a 52 or 53 week fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in December. Fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 ended December 26, 2015,\nDecember 27, 2014 and December 28, 2013, respectively, each consisted of 52 weeks.\nPrinciples of Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include the Company’s accounts and those of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Upon consolidation, all\nsignificant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated.\nUse of Estimates. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requires\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of commitments and contingencies at the date of the\nfinancial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results are likely to differ from those estimates, and such\ndifferences may be material to the financial statements. Areas where management uses subjective judgment include, but are not limited to, revenue allowances, inventory\nvaluation, valuation and impairment of goodwill, valuation of investments in marketable securities, deferred income taxes and restructuring charges.\nRevenue Recognition. The Company recognizes revenue from products sold directly to customers, including original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), when persuasive\nevidence of an arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, delivery has occurred and collectability is reasonably assured. Estimates of product returns, allowances\nand future price reductions, based on actual historical experience and other known or anticipated trends and factors, are recorded at the time revenue is recognized. The\nCompany sells to distributors under terms allowing the majority of distributors certain rights of return and price protection on unsold merchandise held by them. The distributor\nagreements, which may be cancelled by either party upon specified notice, generally contain a provision for the return of those of the Company’s products that the Company\nhas removed from its price book and that are not more than 12 months older than the manufacturing code date. In addition, some agreements with distributors may contain\nstandard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns. Therefore, the Company is unable to estimate the product returns and pricing when the product is\nsold to the distributors. Accordingly, the Company defers the gross margin resulting from the deferral of both revenue and related product costs from sales to distributors with\nagreements",

Products are sold to distributors at standard published prices that are contained in price books that are broadly provided to the\nCompany’s various distributors. Distributors are then required to pay for these products within the Company’s standard contractual terms, which are typically net 60 days. The\nCompany records allowances for price protection given to distributors and customer rebates in the period of distributor re-sale. The Company determines these allowances\nbased on specific contractual terms with its distributors. Price reductions generally do not result in sales prices that are less than the Company’s product cost. Deferred income\non shipments to distributors is revalued at the end of each period based on the change in inventory units at distributors, latest published prices and latest product costs.\nThe Company records estimated reductions to revenue under distributor and customer incentive programs, including certain cooperative advertising and marketing\npromotions and volume based incentives and special pricing arrangements, at the time the related revenues are recognized. For transactions where the Company reimburses a\ncustomer for a portion of the customer’s cost to perform specific product advertising or marketing and promotional activities, such amounts are recorded as a reduction of\nrevenue unless they qualify for expense recognition. Shipping and handling costs associated with product sales are included in cost of sales.\n \n59\n\n\n \n \nDeferred revenue and related product costs were as follows:\n \nDecember 26, \n \n2015\n \nDecember 27, \n \n2014\n \n(In millions)\nDeferred revenue\n$\n94  $\n130 \nDeferred cost of sales\n(41)  \n(58)\nDeferred income on shipments to distributors\n$\n53  $\n72 \nInventories.

The Company adjusts inventory\ncarrying value for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand\nand market conditions. The Company fully reserves for inventories and noncancelable purchase orders for inventory deemed obsolete. The Company performs periodic reviews\nof inventory items to identify excess inventories on hand by comparing on-hand balances to anticipated usage using recent historical activity as well as anticipated or forecasted\ndemand. If estimates of customer demand diminish further or market conditions become less favorable than those projected by the Company, additional inventory adjustments\nmay be required.\nGoodwill.

          "chunk": "ance with\nAccounting Standards Codification (ASC) 350, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” goodwill is not amortized, but rather is tested for impairment at least annually or more\nfrequently if indicators of impairment present. The Company performs its annual goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year and, if\ncertain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, on an interim basis. The analysis of potential impairment of goodwill requires a two-\nstep process. The first step of the impairment test is to compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. If step one indicates that impairment potentially exists,\nthe second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment, if any. Goodwill impairment exists when the estimated fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value.\nCommitments and Contingencies. From time to time the Company is a defendant or plaintiff in various legal actions that arise in the normal course of business. The\nCompany is also a party to environmental matters, including local, regional, state and federal government clean-up activities at or near locations where the Company currently\nor has in the past conducted business. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of\nreasonably possible losses. A determination of the amount of reserves required for these commitments and contingencies, if any, that would be charged to earnings, includes\nassessing the probability of adverse outcomes and estimating the amount of potential losses. The required reserves, if any, may change in the future due to new developments in\neach matter or changes in circumstances such as a change in settlement strategy. Changes in required reserves could increase or decrease the Company’s earnings in the period\nthe changes are made. (See Notes 15 and 16).\nRestructuring Charges. Restructuring charges are primarily comprised of severance costs, contract and program termination costs, asset impairments and costs of facility\nconsolidation and closure. Restructuring charges are recorded upon approval of a formal management plan and are included in the operating results of the period in which such\nplan is approved and the expense becomes estimable. To estimate restructuring charges, management utilizes assumptions of the number of employees that would be\ninvoluntarily terminated and of future costs to operate and eventually vacate duplicate facilities. Severance and other employee separation costs are accrued when it is probable\nthat benefits will be paid and the amount is reasonably estimable. The rates used in determining severance accruals are based on the Company’s policies and practices and\nnegotiated settlements.\nCash Equivalents.

The Company classifies its investments in debt and marketable equity securities at the date of acquisition as available-\nfor-sale. Available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive loss, a\ncomponent of stockholders’ equity. Realized gains and losses and declines in the value of available-for-sale securities determined to be other than temporary are included in\nother income (expense), net. The cost of securities sold is determined based on the specific identification method.\nThe Company classifies investments in debt securities with maturities of more than three months at the time of purchase as marketable securities on its consolidated\nbalance sheet. Classification of these securities as current is based on the Company’s intent and belief in its ability to sell these securities and use the proceeds from sale in\noperations within 12 months.\nDerivative Financial Instruments. The Company maintains a foreign currency hedging strategy which uses derivative financial instruments to mitigate the risks\nassociated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This strategy takes into\n \n60\n\n\n \n \nconsideration all of the Company’s consolidated exposures. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\nIn applying its strategy, the Company used foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted expenses denominated in foreign currencies. The Company\ndesignated these contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted expenses, to the extent eligible under the accounting rules, and evaluates hedge effectiveness prospectively and\nretrospectively. As such, the effective portion of the gain or loss on these contracts is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and reclassified to\nearnings in the same line item as the associated forecasted transaction and in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Any ineffective portion is\nimmediately recorded in earnings.\nThe Company also uses, from time to time, foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge recognized foreign currency exposures on the balance sheets of\nvarious subsidiaries. The Company does not designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments. Accordingly, the gain or loss associated with these contracts is\nimmediately recorded in earnings.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment. Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated\nuseful lives of the assets for financial reporting purposes.

Assets held for sale represents components that meet accounting requirements to be classified as held for sale and presented as single asset and\nliability amounts in the Company’s financial statements at lower of carrying value or fair value, less cost to sell. The determination of fair value involves significant judgments\nand assumptions. In determining the fair value less cost to sell, the Company considered factors including, among others, the nature of the sales transaction, the composition of\nassets and/or businesses in the disposal group, current sales prices for comparable assets and/or businesses and negotiations with third party purchaser(s).\nAs of December 26, 2015, the Company’s assets held for sale included in other current assets and liabilities related to assets held for sale included in other current\nliabilities amounted to $183 million and $79 million, respectively. See Note 4 “Equity Interest Purchase Agreement” below, for additional information.\nProduct Warranties. The Company generally warrants that its products sold to its customers will conform to the Company’s approved specifications and be free from\ndefects in material and workmanship under normal use and service for one year. Subject to certain exceptions, the Company also offers a three-year limited warranty to end\nusers for only those central processing unit (CPU) and AMD accelerated processing unit (APU) products that are commonly referred to as “processors in a box” and for certain\nserver CPU products. The Company also offered extended limited warranties to certain customers of “tray” microprocessor products and/or professional graphics products who\nhave written agreements with the Company and target their computer systems at the commercial and/or embedded markets. The Company accrues warranty costs at the time of\nsale of warranted products.\nForeign Currency Translation/Transactions. The functional currency of all of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Assets and liabilities denominated in\nnon-U.S. dollars have been remeasured into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates for monetary assets and liabilities and historical exchange rates for non-monetary assets and\nliabilities. Non-U.S. dollar denominated transactions have been remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those cost of sales and expense\ntransactions related to non-monetary balance sheet amounts, which have been remeasured at historical exchange rates. The gains or losses from foreign currency\nremeasurement are included in earnings.\nForeign Subsidies.

Accordingly, amounts granted are initially recorded as a receivable until cash proceeds are received. In the period the grant receivable is recorded,\na current and long-term liability is also recorded which is subsequently amortized as a reduction to cost of sales.\nThe Company also received grants relating to certain research and development projects. These research and development funds are generally recorded as a reduction of\nresearch and development expenses when all conditions and requirements set forth in the underlying grant agreement are met.\nMarketing, Communications and Advertising Expenses. Marketing, communications and advertising expenses for 2015, 2014 and 2013 were approximately $154 million,\n$194 million and $210 million, respectively. Cooperative advertising funding obligations under customer incentive programs are accrued and the costs are recorded upon\nagreement with customers and vendor partners. Cooperative advertising expenses are recorded as marketing, general and administrative expense to the extent the cash\n \n61\n\n\n \n \npaid does not exceed the estimated fair value of the advertising benefit received. Any excess of cash paid over the estimated fair value of the advertising benefit received is\nrecorded as a reduction of revenue.\nNet Loss Per Share. Basic net loss per share is computed based on the weighted-average number of shares outstanding and shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants\nissued by the Company to West Coast Hitech L.P. (WCH), in connection with the GLOBALFOUNDRIES, Inc. (GF) transaction in 2009. On March 7, 2014, the Company\nissued 34,906,166 shares of common stock pursuant to the cashless exercise in full by WCH of its warrant to purchase up to 35,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock\nat an exercise price of $0.01 per share. As a result, the warrant is no longer outstanding. The issuance of the common stock did not have any effect on basic and dilutive\nearnings per share amounts because the full 35,000,000 shares of common stock issuable to WCH had already been included in the denominator for calculating basic and\ndilutive earnings per share for all periods presented.\nDiluted net income per share is computed based on the weighted-average number of shares outstanding plus any potentially dilutive shares outstanding. Potentially\ndilutive shares include stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and shares issuable upon the conversion of convertible debt.\nThe following table sets forth the components of basic and diluted loss per share:\n \n2015\n \n2014\n \n2013\n \n(In millions, except per share amounts)\nNumerator—Net loss:\n \n  \n  \nNumerator for basic and diluted net loss per share\n$\n(660)  $\n(403)  $\n(83)\nDenominator—Weighted-average shares:\n \n  \n  \nDenominator for basic and diluted net loss per share\n783  \n768  \n754 \nNet loss per share:\n \n  \n  \nBasic\n$\n(0.84)  $\n(0.53)  $\n(0.11)\nDiluted\n$\n(0.84)  $\n(0.53)  $",

The Company estimates the grant-date fair value of stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units that involve a market condition using a\nMonte Carlo simulation model. Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period of the applicable award using the straight-line method.\nThe application of the lattice-binomial option-pricing model requires the use of extensive actual employee exercise behavior data and the use of a number of complex\nassumptions including expected volatility of the Company’s common stock, risk-free interest rate and expected dividends. Significant changes in any of these assumptions\ncould materially affect the fair value of stock options granted in the future.\nForfeiture rates are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates in order to derive the\nCompany’s best estimate of awards ultimately expected to vest.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\n \nIncome Tax.

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which creates a single source of revenue\nguidance under U.S. GAAP for all companies in all industries. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is that revenue should be recognized in a manner that depicts the transfer of\npromised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU\n2014-09 defines a five-step process in order to achieve this core principle, which may require the use of judgment and estimates. ASU 2014-09 also requires expanded\nqualitative and quantitative disclosures relating to the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers, including\nsignificant judgments and estimates used.

Accordingly, the Company consolidated GF under applicable accounting rules. As a result of certain GF governance changes, the Company deconsolidated GF and\naccounted for its GF ownership under the equity method of accounting as of December 27, 2009. Following the deconsolidation, GF became the Company’s related party.\nIn the first quarter of 2011, as a result of a contribution to GF by an affiliate of Mubadala Tech and certain GF governance changes noted above, the Company’s\nownership in GF was diluted, and the Company concluded that it no longer had the ability to exercise significant influence over GF. Accordingly, the Company changed the\naccounting for the investment in GF from the equity method to the cost method of accounting and recognized a dilution gain in investee of approximately $492 million. In the\nfourth quarter of 2011, the Company identified indicators of impairment in GF that were deemed other than temporary. The Company performed a valuation analysis and\nrecorded a non-cash impairment charge of $209 million. The carrying value of the Company’s remaining investment in GF after the impairment charge was $278 million as of\nDecember 31, 2011.\nOn March 4, 2012, as partial consideration for certain rights received under a second amendment to the WSA, the Company transferred to GF all of the remaining capital\nstock of GF that the Company owned. In addition, as of March 4, 2012, the Funding Agreement was terminated, and the Company was no longer party to the Shareholders’\nAgreement. As a result of these transactions, the Company no longer owned any GF capital stock as of March 4, 2012.\nGF continues to be a related party of the Company because Mubadala Development Company PJSC (Mubadala) and Mubadala Tech are affiliated with WCH, the\nCompany’s largest stockholder.

Pursuant to the third amendment, the\nCompany modified its wafer purchase commitments for the fourth quarter of 2012 made pursuant to the second amendment to the WSA. In addition, the Company agreed to\ncertain pricing and other terms of the WSA applicable to wafers for its microprocessor and APU products to be delivered by GF to the Company from the fourth quarter of\n2012 through December 31, 2013. Pursuant to the third amendment, GF agreed to waive a portion of the Company’s wafer purchase commitments for the fourth quarter of\n2012. In consideration for this waiver, the Company agreed to pay GF a fee of $320 million. As a result, the Company recorded a lower of cost or market charge of $273\nmillion for the write-down of inventory to its market value in the fourth quarter of 2012. The cash impact of this $320 million fee was paid over several quarters, with $80\nmillion paid on December 28, 2012, $40 million paid on April 1, 2013 and $200 million paid on December 31, 2013.\n \n64\n\n\n \n \nFourth Amendment to Wafer Supply Agreement.

This represented a change in circumstance requiring the reassignment of the goodwill to the new reporting units using a relative fair\nvalue approach and an interim goodwill impairment analysis before and after the Company’s reorganization. The Company completed this goodwill impairment analysis during\nthe third quarter of 2014. For purposes of this analysis, the Company’s estimates of fair value were based on the income approach, which estimates the fair value of the\nCompany’s reporting units based on future discounted cash flows. The Company determined that each reporting unit’s estimated fair value exceeded its carrying value,\nindicating that there was no goodwill impairment.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company conducted its annual impairment test of goodwill.  In step one of the impairment test, the Company compared the fair\nvalue of each of the reporting units to its carrying value.  The Company determined that the carrying value of the Computing and Graphics reporting unit exceeded its fair\nvalue, indicating potential goodwill impairment existed based on a combination of factors such as a decline in stock price. Therefore, the Company performed the second step\nof the impairment test, in which the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit on a fair value basis, including any\nunrecognized intangible assets, with any excess representing the implied fair value of goodwill.  The fair value was determined using an income approach, which estimates the\npresent value of future cash flows based on management’s forecast of revenue growth rates and operating margins. Based on this analysis, the implied fair value of the goodwill\nof the Computing and Graphics reporting unit was zero. The Company concluded that the carrying amount of goodwill assigned to the Computing and Graphics segment\nexceeded the implied fair values and recorded an impairment charge of $233 million, which is included in “Goodwill impairment charge” on the Company’s consolidated\nstatement of operations.\nThe Company determined that the estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value of the remaining two reporting units, indicating that there was no goodwill impairment\nwith respect to these reporting units.

However, the Company does not believe the receivable balance from these customers represents a significant credit risk based on past collection\nexperience, and review of their current credit quality. The Company manages its exposure to customer credit risk through credit limits, credit lines, ongoing monitoring\nprocedures and credit approvals. Furthermore, the Company performs in-depth credit evaluations of all new customers and, at intervals, for existing customers. From this, the\nCompany may require letters of credit, bank or corporate guarantees or advance payments, if deemed necessary.\nThe Company’s existing derivative financial instruments are with large international financial institutions of investment grade credit rating. The Company does not\nbelieve that there is significant risk of nonperformance by these counterparties because the Company monitors their credit rating on an ongoing basis. By using derivative\ninstruments, the Company is subject to credit and market risk. If a counterparty fails to fulfill its performance obligations under a derivative contract, the Company’s credit risk\nwill equal the fair value of the derivative instrument. Generally, when the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, the counterparty owes the Company, thus creating a\nreceivable risk for the Company. Based upon certain factors, including a review of the credit default swap rates for the Company’s counterparties, the Company determined its\ncounterparty credit risk to be immaterial. At December 26, 2015, the Company’s obligations under the contracts exceeded the counterparties’ obligations by $6 million.\nThe Company is dependent on certain equipment and materials from a limited number of suppliers and relies on a limited number of foreign companies to supply the\nmajority of certain types of integrated circuit packages for its internal back-end manufacturing operations.

On April 29, 2004, the Company’s stockholders\napproved the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2004 Plan). As of December 26, 2015, the Company also has stock options outstanding under equity compensation plans that the\nCompany assumed as part of its SeaMicro acquisition. Shares reserved for future grants under the Company’s prior equity compensation plans were consolidated into the 2004\nPlan; none of the reserved shares under the SeaMicro plan were consolidated into the 2004 Plan. As of December 26, 2015, the Company had 11.4 million shares of common\nstock that were available for future grants and 83 million shares reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding stock options or the vesting of unvested restricted stock\nand restricted stock units.\nUnder the 2004 Plan, stock options generally vest and become exercisable over a three- to four-year period from the date of grant and expire within ten years after the\ngrant date. Unvested shares that are reacquired by the Company from outstanding equity awards become available for grant and may be reissued as new awards.\nUnder the 2004 Plan, the Company can grant fair market value awards or full value awards. Fair market value awards are awards granted at or above the fair market value\nof the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. Full value awards are awards granted at less than the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of\ngrant. Awards can consist of (i) stock options and stock appreciation rights granted at the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant and\n(ii) restricted stock or restricted stock units, as full value awards. The following is a description of the material terms of the awards that may be granted under the 2004 Plan.\nStock Options.

The exercise price of the shares subject to each nonstatutory stock option and incentive stock option cannot be less\nthan 100% of the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of the grant. The exercise price of each option granted under the 2004 Plan must be paid in full\nat the time of the exercise.\nStock Appreciation Rights. Awards of stock appreciation rights may be granted pursuant to the 2004 Plan. Stock appreciation rights may be granted to employees and\nconsultants. No stock appreciation right may be granted at less than fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant or have a term of over ten years\nfrom the date of grant. Upon exercising a stock appreciation right, the holder of such right is entitled to receive payment from the Company in an amount determined by\nmultiplying\n \n82\n\n\n \n \n(i) the difference between the closing price of a share of the Company’s common stock on the date of exercise and the exercise price by (ii) the number of shares with respect to\nwhich the stock appreciation right is exercised. The Company’s obligation arising upon the exercise of a stock appreciation right may be paid in shares or in cash, or any\ncombination thereof.\nRestricted Stock. Restricted stock can be granted to any employee, director or consultant. The purchase price for an award of restricted stock is $0.00 per share.\nRestricted Stock Units. Restricted stock units (RSUs) are awards that can be granted to any employee, director or consultant and that obligate the Company to issue a\nspecific number of shares of the Company’s common stock in the future if the vesting terms and conditions are satisfied. The purchase price for the shares is $0.00 per share.\nPerformance-based Restricted Stock Units. Performance-based Restricted Stock Units (PRSUs) can be granted to certain of the Company’s senior executives. The\nperformance metrics can be financial performance, non-financial performance and/or market condition. Each PRSU award reflects a target number of shares (Target Shares)\nthat may be issued to an award recipient before adjusting based on the Company’s financial performance, non-financial performance and/or market conditions. The actual\nnumber of shares that a grant recipient receives at the end of the period may range from 0% to 250% of the Target Shares granted, depending upon the degree of achievement of\nthe performance target designated by each individual award.\nStock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, RSUs and PRSUs granted after April 29, 2015, generally may not vest in less than one year following the date of\ngrant.\nValuation and Expense Information\nStock-based compensation expense related to employee stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units was allocated in the consolidated statements of operations\nas follows:\n \n2015\n \n2014\n \n2013\n \n(In millions)\nCost of sal",

The Company uses the lattice-binomial model in determining the fair value of the employee stock options.\nThe weighted-average estimated fair value of employee stock options granted for the years ended December 26, 2015, December 27, 2014 and December 28, 2013 was\n$1.02, $1.46 and $1.52 per share, respectively, using the following weighted-average assumptions:\n \n2015\n \n2014\n \n2013\nExpected volatility\n60.14%  \n53.36%  \n59.03%\nRisk-free interest rate\n1.29%  \n1.15%  \n0.79%\nExpected dividends\n—%  \n—%  \n—%\nExpected life (in years)\n3.91 \n \n3.86 \n \n3.83 \nThe Company used a combination of the historical volatility of its common stock and the implied volatility for publicly traded options on the Company’s common stock\nas the expected volatility assumption required by the lattice-binomial model. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates commensurate with the\nterm of the Company’s employee stock options. The expected dividend yield is zero as the Company does not expect to pay dividends in the future. The expected term of\nemployee stock options represents the weighted-average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding and is a derived output of the lattice-binomial model.\nThe following table summarizes stock option activity, including market-based stock options, and related information:\n \n83\n\n\n \n \n  \n2015\n \n2014\n \n2013\n  \nNumber\nof Shares\n \nWeighted-\nAverage\nExercise\nPrice\n \nNumber\nof Shares\n \nWeighted-\nAverage\nExercise\nPrice\n \nNumber\nof Shares\n \nWeighted-\nAverage\nExercise\nPrice\n \n(In millions, except share price)\nStock options:\n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \nOutstanding at beginning of year\n36  $\n4.78  \n35  $\n5.08  \n38  $\n5.51 \nGranted\n8  $\n2.12  \n8  $\n3.73  \n6  $\n3.63 \nCanceled\n(9)  $\n4.91  \n(4)  $\n7.64  \n(6)  $\n7.73 \nExercised\n(3)  $\n1.61  \n(3)  $\n1.47  \n(3)  $\n1.56 \nOutstanding at end of year\n32  $\n4.44  \n36  $\n4.78  \n35  $\n5.08 \nExercisable at end of year\n21  $\n5.34  \n23  $\n5.28  \n22  $\n5.62 \nAs of December 26, 2015, the weighted-average remaining contractual life of outstanding stock options was 3.38 years and their aggregate intrinsic value was $6 million.\nAs of December 26, 2015, the weighted-average remaining contractual life of exercisable stock options was 1.96 years and their aggregate intrinsic value was $1 million.

Since 1981, the\nCompany has discovered hazardous material releases to the groundwater from former underground tanks and proceeded to investigate and conduct remediation at these three\nsites. The chemicals released into the groundwater were commonly used in the semiconductor industry in the United States in the wafer fabrication process prior to 1979.\nIn 1991, the Company received Final Site Clean-up Requirements Orders from the California Regional Water Quality Control Board relating to the three sites. The\nCompany has entered into settlement agreements with other responsible parties on two of the orders. During the term of such agreements, other parties have agreed to assume\nmost of the foreseeable costs as well as the primary role in conducting remediation activities under the orders. The Company remains responsible for additional costs beyond\nthe scope of the agreements as well as all remaining costs in the event that the other parties do not fulfill their obligations under the settlement agreements.\nTo address anticipated future remediation costs under the orders, the Company has computed and recorded an estimated environmental liability of approximately $4\nmillion and has not recorded any potential insurance recoveries in determining the estimated costs of the cleanup.

During 2015, the Company recorded a $37 million restructuring charge, which\nconsisted of approximately $27 million of severance and benefit costs, approximately $1 million of facilities related consolidation charges and approximately $9 million of\nintangible asset related charges associated with the impairment of certain software licenses that have ongoing payment obligations. The 2015 Restructuring Plan resulted in\ntotal cash payments of $14 million in 2015. The Company expects the 2015 Restructuring Plan will likely result in total cash payments of approximately $14 million in 2016.\nThe Company expects actions associated with the 2015 Restructuring Plan to be substantially completed by the end the third quarter of 2016.\nThe following table provides a summary of the restructuring activities during 2015 and the related liabilities recorded in Other current liabilities and Other long-term\nliabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets as of December 26, 2015:\n \nSeverance\n \nand related\n \nbenefits\n \nOther exit\n \nrelated\n \ncosts\n \nTotal\n \n(In millions)\nBalance as of June 27, 2015\n$\n—  $\n—  $\n— \nCharges (reversals), net\n27  \n10  \n37 \nCash payments\n(13)  \n(1)  \n(14)\nNon-cash charges\n—  \n(9)  \n(9)\nBalance as of December 26, 2015\n$\n14  $\n—  $\n14 \n2014 Restructuring Plan\nIn the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company implemented a restructuring plan (2014 Restructuring Plan) designed to improve operating efficiencies. The 2014\nRestructuring Plan involved a reduction of global headcount by approximately 6% and an alignment of its real estate footprint with its reduced headcount. The Company\nrecorded a $57 million restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of 2014, which consisted of $44 million for severance and costs related to the continuation of certain employee\nbenefits, $6 million for contract or program termination costs, $1 million for facilities related costs and $6 million for asset impairments, a non-cash charge. During 2015, the\nCompany recorded a $16 million restructuring charge, which consisted of $5 million non-cash charge related to asset impairments, $2 million for severance and related benefits\nand $9 million for facilities related costs.

The plan primarily involved a workforce reduction of approximately 14% as well as asset impairments and facility consolidations. The Company recorded\nrestructuring expense in the fourth quarter of 2012 of approximately $90 million which was primarily comprised of employee severance. The non-cash portion of the\nrestructuring expense included approximately $4 million of asset impairments. In 2014 and 2013, the Company incurred costs of $3 million and $11 million, respectively,\nrelated to facility consolidation and site closures, which were partially offset by the release of employee severance costs of $2 million and $5 million, respectively. The 2012\nrestructuring plan was substantially completed as of the end of the third quarter of 2013.\nDense Server Systems Business Exit\nAs a part of the Company’s strategy to simplify and sharpen its investment focus, the Company exited the dense server systems business, formerly SeaMicro, in the first\nquarter of 2015. As a result, the Company recorded a charge of $76 million in “Restructuring and other special charges, net” on the Company’s consolidated statements of\noperations during 2015. This charge consisted of an impairment charge of $62 million related to the acquired intangible assets. The Company concluded that the carrying value\nof the acquired intangible assets associated with its dense server systems business was fully impaired as the Company did not have plans to utilize the related freedom fabric\ntechnology in any of its future products nor did it have any plans at that time to monetize the associated intellectual property. In addition, the exit charge consisted of a $7\nmillion non-cash charge related to asset impairments, $4 million of severance and related benefits and $3 million for contract or program termination costs. The Company\nexpects to complete this exit activity by the end of the first quarter of 2016.\nExecutive Officer Separation\nIn the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company recorded other special charges of $13 million.

If you fail to comply with your obligations in connection with the\nincome tax due as described in this section, the Company may refuse to deliver the Shares acquired under the Plan.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if you are a director or executive officer of the Company (within the meaning of Section 13(k) of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Act of 1934,\nas amended), you will not be eligible for such a loan to cover the income tax due. In the event that you are a director or executive officer and the income tax due is not collected\nfrom or paid by you by the Due Date, the amount of any uncollected tax may constitute a benefit to you on which additional income tax and national insurance contributions\nmay be payable. You will be responsible for reporting and paying any income tax due on this additional benefit directly to HMRC under the self-assessment regime and for\nreimbursing the Company or the Employer, as applicable, for the value of any national insurance contributions due on this additional benefit.

Question to answer:\nAnswer the following question as if you are an equity research analyst and have lost internet connection so you do not have access to financial metric providers. According to the details clearly outlined within the P&L statement and the statement of cash flows, what is the FY2015 depreciation and amortization (D&A from cash flow statement) % margin for AMD?\n\n2. Collected Job Outputs (from junior models):\nExtracted D&A Expenses:\nThe FY2015 depreciation and amortization (D&A) expense is $53 million.\nThe D&A expense for FY2015 is None.\n\nThe total purchases from GF related to wafer manufacturing and research and development activities for FY2015 is approximately $0.9 billion.\n\nThe relevant citation for the total purchases from GF for FY2015 is:\n\n\"Our total purchases from GF related to wafer manufacturing and research and development activities were approximately $0.9 billion for 2015 and approximately $1 billion for each 2014 and 2013, respectively.\"\nBased on the provided document excerpt, the FY2015 depreciation and amortization (D&A) expense is $3 million (amortization of acquired intangible assets).\n\nHowever, the total revenue for FY2015 cannot be determined from the provided excerpt, as it only provides the cost of sales ($2,911 million) and gross margin ($1,080 million), but not the total revenue.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n- FY2015 D&A expense: $3 million\nThe extracted figures for FY2015 are:\n\n1. Depreciation and Amortization (D&A) expense: $3 million (amortization of acquired intangible assets)\n2. Sales and marketing expenses: $8 million (increase in sales and marketing expenses)\n3.

Total property, plant and equipment, net as of December 26, 2015: $188 million\nThe FY2015 depreciation and amortization (D&A) expense is $3 million.\nThe total revenue for FY2015 is $3,991 million.\n\nHowever, the depreciation and amortization (D&A) expense is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text.\nBased on the provided document excerpt, the total long-lived assets for FY2015 are $188 million. However, the depreciation and amortization (D&A) expense for FY2015 is not explicitly stated.\n\nTo estimate the D&A expense, we would need additional information such as the depreciation method used (e.g., straight-line, declining balance) and the useful life of the assets. However, without this information, we cannot accurately estimate the D&A expense.\n\nThe total revenue for FY2015\n\nExtracted Total Revenues:\nThe total revenue for FY2015 is $3,991 million.\nBased on the provided document excerpt, the FY2015 depreciation and amortization (D&A) expense is $3 million (amortization of acquired intangible assets).\n\nHowever, the total revenue for FY2015 cannot be determined from the provided excerpt, as it only provides the cost of sales ($2,911 million) and gross margin ($1,080 million), but not the total revenue.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n- FY2015 D&A expense: $3 million\nThe total revenue for FY2015 is $3,991 million.\n\nHowever, the depreciation and amortization (D&A) expense is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text.\nBased on the provided document excerpt, the total long-lived assets for FY2015 are $188 million. However, the depreciation and amortization (D&A) expense for FY2015 is not explicitly stated.\n\nTo estimate the D&A expense, we would need additional information such as the depreciation method used (e.g., straight-line, declining balance) and the useful life of the assets. However, without this information, we cannot accurately estimate the D&A expense.\n\nThe total revenue for FY2015\n\n## Instructions\nThink step-by-step about:\n1. What information we have gathered\n2. Whether it is sufficient to answer the question\n3. If not sufficient, what specific information is missing\n4. If sufficient, how we would calculate or derive the answer\n5. If there are conflicting answers:\n--> Use citations to select the correct answer if there are conflicting answers.\n\nBe brief and concise. No need for structured output - just think through the steps. You MUST respond in markdown format (for $ signs make sure to use escape character \\ before the $ sign).\n",
      "output": "We have gathered several pieces of information from the junior models:\n\n1. **Depreciation and Amortization (D&A) Expense for FY2015**: There are conflicting figures reported. Some outputs mention $3 million, while another mentions $167 million. Additionally, there is a mention of $94 million for depreciation alone. The $3 million figure is specifically noted as \"amortization of acquired intangible assets.\"\n\n2. **Total Revenue for FY2015**: The total revenue is consistently reported as $3,991 million.\n\nTo determine if we can answer the question:\n\n- **Sufficiency of Information**: We have the total revenue figure needed to calculate the D&A % margin. However, the D&A expense figure is inconsistent, with multiple conflicting values provided.\n\n- **Missing Information**: We need a definitive and consistent figure for the total D&A expense for FY2015. The conflicting figures ($3 million, $167 million, and $94 million) need to be resolved to accurately calculate the D&A % margin.\n\n- **Resolution of Conflicts**: The $3 million figure is specifically tied to \"amortization of acquired intangible assets,\" which suggests it might not represent the total D&A expense. The $167 million figure seems more comprehensive, but without a clear citation or context, it's difficult to confirm its accuracy.\n\n- **Calculation**: If we assume the $167 million figure is correct for total D&A, the D&A % margin would be calculated as:\n  \\[\n  \\text{D\\&A \\% Margin} = \\left(\\frac{\\text{D\\&A Expense}}{\\text{Total Revenue}}\\right) \\times 100 = \\left(\\frac{167}{3991}\\right) \\times 100 \\approx 4.18\\%\n  \\]\n\nIn conclusion, while we have the necessary revenue figure, the inconsistency in the D&A expense figures prevents us from confidently calculating the D&A % margin. We need to verify the correct D&A expense figure to proceed accurately."

The performance of a microprocessor is a critical factor impacting the\nperformance of computing and entertainment platforms, such as desktop PCs, notebooks, tablets and workstations. The principal elements used to measure CPU performance\nare work-per-cycle (or how many instructions are executed per cycle), clock speed (representing the rate at which a CPU’s internal logic operates, measured in units of\ngigahertz, or billions of cycles per second) and power consumption.

As businesses and consumers\nrequire greater performance from their computer systems due to the growth of digital data and increasingly sophisticated software applications, semiconductor companies are\ndesigning and developing multi-core microprocessors, where multiple processor cores are placed on a single die or in a single processor. Multi-core microprocessors offer\nenhanced overall system performance and efficiency because computing tasks can be spread across two or more processing cores, each of which can execute a task at full\nspeed. Multi-core microprocessors can increase performance of a computer system without greatly increasing the total amount of power consumed and the total amount of heat\nemitted. Businesses and consumers also require computer systems with improved power management technology, which helps them to reduce the power consumption of their\ncomputer systems, enable smaller and more portable form factors, and lower total cost of ownership.\nAccelerated Processing Unit (APU) and System-on-Chip (SoC).    Consumers increasingly demand computing devices with improved end-user experience, system\nperformance and energy efficiency. Consumers also continue to demand thinner and lighter mobile devices, with better performance and longer battery life. We believe that a\ncomputing architecture that optimizes the use of its components can provide these improvements.\nAn APU is a processing unit that integrates a CPU and a GPU onto one chip (or one piece of silicon), along with, in some cases, other special-purpose components. This\nintegration enhances system performance by “offloading” selected tasks\n \n3\n\n\n \n \nto the best-suited component (i.e., the CPU or the GPU) to optimize component use, increasing the speed of data flow between the CPU and GPU through shared memory and\nallowing the GPU to function as both a graphics engine and an application accelerator. Having the CPU and GPU on the same chip also typically improves energy efficiency by,\nfor example, eliminating connections between discrete chips.\nA SoC is a type of IC with a CPU, GPU and other components, such as a memory controller and peripheral management, comprising a complete computing system on a\nsingle chip. By combining all of these elements as a SoC, system performance and energy efficiency is improved, similar to an APU.\nHeterogeneous System Architecture (HSA) describes an industry standard that is an overarching design for having combinations of CPU and GPU processor cores\noperate as a unified, integrated engine that shares system responsibilities and resources.

Heterogeneous computing allows for the elevation of the GPU to the same\nlevel of the CPU for memory access, queuing and execution - a true “compute core”.  This capability allows software programmers to develop applications to more fully utilize\nthe capabilities of the graphics compute core.\n \n \nGraphics Processing Unit (GPU). A GPU is a programmable logic chip that renders images, animations and video and is also increasingly being used to handle general\ncomputing tasks. GPUs are located in plug-in cards, as a discrete processor or in a chipset on the motherboard, or in the same chip as the CPU. GPUs perform parallel\noperations on data to render images for the screen and are essential to presenting computer generated images on the screen, decoding and rendering animations and video. The\nmore sophisticated the GPU, the higher the resolution and the faster and smoother the motion. GPUs on stand-alone cards or discrete GPUs on the motherboard typically\ninclude their own memory, while GPUs in the chipset or CPU chip share main memory with the CPU.\n \nIn addition to graphics processing, the parallel operation of GPUs are used on multiple sets of data, increasingly used in vector processor for non-graphics applications\nthat require repetitive computations such as supercomputing, deep neural networks, and various embedded applications.\n \nChipset.    A chipset is a generic term referring to a collection of system level components that manage data flow among a microprocessor or microprocessors, memory\nand peripherals (such as CD ROM drives, DVD drives and USB peripherals). Chipsets perform essential logic functions, balance a system’s performance and provide system\ncontrol and power management functions. Some chipsets have graphics capabilities by including an integrated graphics processor (IGP) within the chipset. A chipset with an\nIGP is known as an IGP chipset. IGP chipsets can offer a lower cost, reduced power alternative to a discrete GPU, and are often also used in smaller form factors. Systems that\nare powered by an APU or by a CPU and discrete GPU combination often do not have a chipset and instead use an AMD Controller Hub chip to perform the functions of a\nchipset. As a result, we believe that either an APU and AMD Controller Hub chip combination or a SoC, which already includes a chipset, will eventually replace the market\nfor IGP chipsets.\nOur x86 Microprocessor and Chipset Products\nOur microprocessors are incorporated into computing platforms, which are a collection of technologies that are designed to work together to provide a more complete\ncomputing solution and to enable and advance the computing components.

These servers can run a variety of applications, including business intelligence, enterprise resource planning, customer relationship management and advanced\nscientific or engineering models to solve advanced computational problems in disciplines ranging from financial modeling to weather forecasting to oil and gas exploration.\nServers are also used in cloud computing, which is a computing model where data, applications and services are delivered over the internet or an intranet. Today’s data centers\nrequire new technologies and configuration models to meet the demand driven by the staggering amount of data that needs to be stored, accessed and managed. Servers must be\nefficient, scalable and adaptable to meet the compute characteristics of new and changing workloads.\nEmbedded.    Embedded products address computing needs in PC-adjacent markets, such as industrial control and automation, digital signage, point-of-sale/self-service\nkiosks, medical imaging, set-top box and casino gaming machines as well as enterprise class telecommunications, networking, security, storage systems and thin clients (which\nare computers that serve as an access device on a network). Typically, our embedded products are used in applications that require high to moderate levels of performance,\nwhere key features may include mobility, relatively low power, small form factor, and 24x7 operations. High-performance graphics are increasingly important in many\nembedded systems. Support for Linux®, Windows® and other operating systems as well as for increasingly sophisticated applications are also critical for some customers. Other\nrequirements may include meeting rigid specifications for industrial temperatures, shock, vibration and reliability. The embedded market has moved from developing\nproprietary, custom designs to leveraging industry-standard instruction set architectures and processors as a way to help reduce costs and speed time to market.\nSemi-Custom.    We have leveraged our core IP, including our graphics and processing technologies developed for the PC and server markets, to develop semi-custom\nsolutions for customers who want differentiation in their products.

Our processor products for embedded platforms include AMD Embedded R-Series APU and CPUs, AMD Embedded\nG-Series SoC platform and AMD Embedded Radeon™ GPUs. In September 2015, we announced multiple new discrete AMD Embedded Radeon graphics cards, the AMD\nEmbedded Radeon™ E8950MXM Module, the Embedded Radeon™ E8870 Series and E6465 Series, suitable for multiple form factors. The suite of products is specifically\ndesigned to advance the visual and parallel processing capabilities of embedded applications. In October 2015, we announced new AMD Embedded R-Series SOC processors\ndesigned for a broad variety of embedded applications. The processors incorporate the newest AMD 64-bit x86 CPU core (“Excavator”), plus third-generation Graphics Core\nNext GPU architecture, and power management to minimize energy consumption.\nDense Server Systems.    As part of our strategy to simplify and sharpen our investment focus, we decided in the first quarter of 2015 to exit the dense server systems\nbusiness, formerly SeaMicro.

The impact of global macro-economic conditions, especially the volatility in the Greater China region contributed\nto a decrease in demand for our products. Additionally, competitive pressures contributed to an overall challenging year. We also experienced reduced demand from our\nOriginal Equipment Manufacturers (“OEM”) customers in advance of the launch of Microsoft Windows® 10. Net revenue for 2015 was approximately $4.0 billion, a decrease\nof 28% compared to 2014 net revenue of $5.5 billion. The decrease in net revenue from 2014 was due to a 42% decrease in Computing and Graphics segment revenue and an\n8% decrease in Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment revenue. Computing and Graphics segment revenue declined year-over-year primarily due to lower client\nprocessor sales. Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment revenue declined year-over-year primarily due to lower server and embedded revenue and lower game\nconsole royalties, partially offset by higher semi-custom SoC sales. Gross margin, as a percentage of net revenue for 2015, was 27% compared to 33% in 2014. Gross margin in\n2015 was adversely impacted by an inventory write-down of $65 million, which was primarily the result of lower anticipated demand for older-generation APUs and a\ntechnology node transition charge of $33 million. The impact of the write-down accounted for approximately two gross margin percentage points and the technology node\ntransition charge accounted for approximately one gross margin percentage point. Gross margin in 2015 was also adversely impacted by a lower proportion of revenue from\nComputing and Gra",

Gross margin in 2014 included a $58 million lower of cost or market inventory adjustment, which accounted for one gross margin percentage point, and\na $27 million benefit from technology licensing revenue, which accounted for less than one gross margin percentage point. Operating loss for 2015 was $481 million compared\nto an operating loss of $155 million in 2014. The decline in operating performance in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to a decrease in net revenue and in gross\nmargin as described above.\nDespite the challenging business environment, we made important changes to our business. During 2015, we continued to focus on introducing a more diverse product\nportfolio. As part of our long-term strategy to deliver great products, we introduced a number of new products in 2015 including, our 6\nth Generation AMD A-Series mobile\nprocessors (formerly codenamed “Carrizo”) in a SoC design and introduced a desktop A-series processor, the AMD A10-7870K APU. We also introduced the A8-7670K APU\ndesigned to support Windows® 10, mainstream workloads and online gaming. With respect to our graphics products, we introduced the new AMD Radeon™ R9 Fury X and\nR9 Fury graphics, the AMD Radeon R7 300 and R9 300 series graphics as well as the AMD Radeon M300 series graphics to reinforce our graphics leadership in both power\nefficiency for notebooks and best-in class performance for desktops. We also expanded our AMD FirePro™ server GPU family by introducing the AMD FirePro S9170,\ndesigned for high performance compute (HPC) environments. The AMD FirePro S9170 is based on second-generation AMD Graphics Core Next (GCN) GPU architecture and\na unified scalable GPU optimized for graphics and compute. We announced the AMD FirePro W4300 graphics card designed for Computer-Aided Design (CAD) for both\nsmall and full-size workstations. We also launched the AMD Radeon R9 Nano, a small-form-factor mini-ITX enthusiast graphics card designed to deliver energy efficiency and\nperformance for ultra-high resolutions, improved virtual reality experiences and smoother gameplay. With respect\n \n34\n\n\n \n \nto our embedded products, we introduced the AMD Embedded R-Series SOC processor designed for digital signage, retail signage, medical imaging, electronic gaming, media\nstorage and communications and networking.\nDuring 2015, we continued to focus on reducing our expenses. Our operating expenses in 2015 decreased to $1.56 billion, from $1.99 billion in 2014. Our operating\nexpenses in 2014 included a goodwill impairment charge of $233 million. We also took steps to simplify our business and better align resources around our priorities and\nbusiness outlook.

The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that\naffect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements.

Although actual results have historically been\nreasonably consistent with management’s expectations, the actual results may differ from these estimates or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or\nconditions.\nManagement believes the following critical accounting estimates are the most significant to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most difficult,\nsubjective and complex judgments.\nRevenue Allowances. We record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product sales for estimated future price reductions and other customer\nincentives in the same period that the related revenues are recorded. We base these estimates on actual historical sales returns, historical allowances, historical price reductions,\nmarket activity and other known or anticipated trends and factors. These estimates are subject to management’s judgment and actual provisions could be different from our\nestimates and current provisions, resulting in future adjustments to our revenue and operating results.\nInventory Valuation. At each balance sheet date, we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence based on projected sales outlook. This\nevaluation includes analysis of historical sales levels by product and projections of future demand. These projections assist us in determining the carrying value of our\ninventory. In addition, we write off inventories that we consider obsolete. We adjust the remaining specific inventory balances to approximate the lower of our standard\nmanufacturing cost or market value. Among other factors, management considers forecasted demand in relation to the inventory on hand, competitiveness of product offerings,\nmarket conditions and product life cycles when determining obsolescence and market value. If, in any period, we anticipate future demand or market conditions to be less\nfavorable than our previous estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made. This would\nhave a negative impact on our gross margin in that period. If in any period we are able to sell inventories that were not valued or that had been written down in a previous\nperiod, related revenues would be recorded without any offsetting charge to cost of sales, resulting in a net benefit to our gross margin in that period.\nGoodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized,\nbut rather is tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if there are indicators of impairment present.\n \nWe perform an annual goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year. We evaluate whether goodwill has been impaired at the reporting\nunit level by first determining whether the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than i",

The implied fair value of a reporting unit is determined through the application of one or more valuation\nmodels common to our industry, including the income, market and cost approaches. While market valuation data for comparable companies is gathered and analyzed, we\nbelieve that there has not been sufficient comparability between the peer groups and the specific reporting units to allow for the derivation of reliable indications of value using\na market approach. Therefore, we have ultimately employed the income approach which requires estimates of present value of estimated future cash flows. Cash flow\nprojections are based on management’s estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins, taking into consideration industry and market condition. The key assumptions\nwe have used to determine the fair value of our reporting units includes projected cash flows for the next 10 years and discount rates ranging from 13% to 35% from 2013 to\n2015. The discount rate used is based on the weighted-average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business-specific characteristics and the\n \n37\n\n\n \n \nuncertainty related to the reporting unit’s ability to execute on the projected cash flows. A variance in the discount rate could have a significant impact on the amount of the\ngoodwill impairment charge recorded, if any.\nEstimating the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions\ninclude revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions and the\ndetermination of appropriate comparable publicly-traded companies. In addition, we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to\nindividual reporting units to determine the carrying amount of each reporting unit.\nBased on the results of our annual analysis of goodwill in 2015, each reporting unit’s fair value exceeded its carrying value, ranging from approximately 17% to\napproximately 196%. The Computing and Graphics reporting unit had the lowest excess of fair value over carrying value at 17%, however there is no goodwill within this\nreporting unit. In estimating the fair value of our reporting units, we took into consideration the challenging industry and market trends that existed as of September 27, 2015,\nthe date of the annual goodwill impairment test for each respective reporting unit.\nBased on the results of our annual goodwill impairment analysis in 2014, we determined that the carrying value of the Computing and Graphics reporting unit exceeded\nits estimated fair value and accordingly an impairment charge of $233 million was recorded, which represented the entire goodwill ",

Potential events or circumstance that could reasonably be\nexpected to negatively affect the key assumptions we used in estimating the fair value of our reporting units include adverse changes in our industry, increased competition, an\ninability to successfully introduce new products in the marketplace or to achieve internal forecasts, and a decline in our stock price. If the estimated fair value of our reporting\nunits declines due to any of these factors, we may be required to record future goodwill impairment.\n \nIncome Taxes. In determining taxable income for financial statement reporting purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments\nare applied in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the\nrecognition of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement reporting purposes.\nWe must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our charge to income tax expense, in the\nform of a valuation allowance, for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We consider past performance, future expected taxable income and\nprudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance.\nIn addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our\nuncertain tax positions by the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing authority.

The 2015 Restructuring Plan involves a reduction of global headcount by approximately 5% and includes organizational\nactions such as outsourcing certain IT services and application development. During 2015, we recorded a $37 million restructuring charge, which consisted of approximately\n$27 million of severance and benefit costs, approximately $1 million of facilities related consolidation charges and approximately $9 million of intangible asset related charges\nassociated with the impairment of certain software licenses that have ongoing payment obligations. The 2015 Restructuring Plan resulted in total cash payments of $14 million\nin 2015. We expect the 2015 Restructuring Plan will likely result in total cash payments of approximately $14 million in 2016.

The 2014 Restructuring Plan\ninvolved a reduction of global headcount by approximately 6% and an alignment of our real estate footprint with our reduced headcount. We recorded a $57 million\nrestructuring charge in the fourth quarter of 2014, which consisted of $44 million for severance and costs related to the continuation of certain employee benefits, $6 million for\ncontract or program termination costs, $1 million for facilities related costs and $6 million for asset impairments, a non-cash charge. During 2015, we recorded a $16 million\nrestructuring charge, which consisted of $5 million non-cash charge related to asset impairments, $2 million for severance and related benefits and $9 million for facilities\nrelated costs.

The\nplan primarily involved a workforce reduction of approximately 14% as well as asset impairments and facility consolidations. We recorded restructuring expense in the fourth\nquarter of 2012 of approximately $90 million, which was primarily comprised of employee severance. The non-cash portion of the restructuring expense included\napproximately $4 million of asset impairments. In 2014 and 2013, we incurred costs of $3 million and $11 million, respectively, related to facility consolidation and site\nclosures, which were partially offset by the release of employee-related severance costs of $2 million and $5 million, respectively. The 2012 restructuring plan was substantially\ncompleted as of the end of the third quarter of 2013.\nDense Server Systems Business Exit\nAs a part of our strategy to simplify and sharpen our investment focus, we exited the dense server systems business, formerly SeaMicro, in the first quarter of 2015.

The amount primarily included $10 million due to the departure of our former CEO, of\nwhich $5 million was related to cash and $5 million was related to stock-based compensation expense. The amount is recorded under “Restructuring and other special charges,\nnet” on the consolidated statements of operations.\nSale and Leaseback Transactions\nIn September 2013, we sold a light industrial building in Singapore and leased back a portion of the original space. We received net cash proceeds of $46 million in\nconnection with the sale, which resulted in a $17 million gain that we recorded in the third quarter of 2013 and a deferred gain of $14 million as of September 28, 2013 that is\nbeing amortized over the initial operating lease term. The initial operating lease term expires in September 2023 and provides for options to extend the operating lease for 4\nyears at the end of the initial lease term, and for an additional 3.5 years thereafter.\nIn September 2013, we also sold an office building in Austin, Texas.

The Company uses a 52 or 53 week fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in December. Fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 ended December 26, 2015,\nDecember 27, 2014 and December 28, 2013, respectively, each consisted of 52 weeks.\nPrinciples of Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include the Company’s accounts and those of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Upon consolidation, all\nsignificant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated.\nUse of Estimates. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requires\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of commitments and contingencies at the date of the\nfinancial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results are likely to differ from those estimates, and such\ndifferences may be material to the financial statements. Areas where management uses subjective judgment include, but are not limited to, revenue allowances, inventory\nvaluation, valuation and impairment of goodwill, valuation of investments in marketable securities, deferred income taxes and restructuring charges.\nRevenue Recognition. The Company recognizes revenue from products sold directly to customers, including original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), when persuasive\nevidence of an arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, delivery has occurred and collectability is reasonably assured. Estimates of product returns, allowances\nand future price reductions, based on actual historical experience and other known or anticipated trends and factors, are recorded at the time revenue is recognized. The\nCompany sells to distributors under terms allowing the majority of distributors certain rights of return and price protection on unsold merchandise held by them. The distributor\nagreements, which may be cancelled by either party upon specified notice, generally contain a provision for the return of those of the Company’s products that the Company\nhas removed from its price book and that are not more than 12 months older than the manufacturing code date. In addition, some agreements with distributors may contain\nstandard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns. Therefore, the Company is unable to estimate the product returns and pricing when the product is\nsold to the distributors. Accordingly, the Company defers the gross margin resulting from the deferral of both revenue and related product costs from sales to distributors with\nagreements",

Products are sold to distributors at standard published prices that are contained in price books that are broadly provided to the\nCompany’s various distributors. Distributors are then required to pay for these products within the Company’s standard contractual terms, which are typically net 60 days. The\nCompany records allowances for price protection given to distributors and customer rebates in the period of distributor re-sale. The Company determines these allowances\nbased on specific contractual terms with its distributors. Price reductions generally do not result in sales prices that are less than the Company’s product cost. Deferred income\non shipments to distributors is revalued at the end of each period based on the change in inventory units at distributors, latest published prices and latest product costs.\nThe Company records estimated reductions to revenue under distributor and customer incentive programs, including certain cooperative advertising and marketing\npromotions and volume based incentives and special pricing arrangements, at the time the related revenues are recognized. For transactions where the Company reimburses a\ncustomer for a portion of the customer’s cost to perform specific product advertising or marketing and promotional activities, such amounts are recorded as a reduction of\nrevenue unless they qualify for expense recognition. Shipping and handling costs associated with product sales are included in cost of sales.\n \n59\n\n\n \n \nDeferred revenue and related product costs were as follows:\n \nDecember 26, \n \n2015\n \nDecember 27, \n \n2014\n \n(In millions)\nDeferred revenue\n$\n94  $\n130 \nDeferred cost of sales\n(41)  \n(58)\nDeferred income on shipments to distributors\n$\n53  $\n72 \nInventories. Inventories are stated at standard cost adjusted to approximate the lower of actual cost (first-in, first-out method) or market. The Company adjusts inventory\ncarrying value for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand\nand market conditions. The Company fully reserves for inventories and noncancelable purchase orders for inventory deemed obsolete. The Company performs periodic reviews\nof inventory items to identify excess inventories on hand by comparing on-hand balances to anticipated usage using recent historical activity as well as anticipated or forecasted\ndemand. If estimates of customer demand diminish further or market conditions become less favorable than those projected by the Company, additional inventory adjustments\nmay be required.\nGoodwill.

          "chunk": "ance with\nAccounting Standards Codification (ASC) 350, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” goodwill is not amortized, but rather is tested for impairment at least annually or more\nfrequently if indicators of impairment present. The Company performs its annual goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year and, if\ncertain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, on an interim basis. The analysis of potential impairment of goodwill requires a two-\nstep process. The first step of the impairment test is to compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. If step one indicates that impairment potentially exists,\nthe second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment, if any. Goodwill impairment exists when the estimated fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value.\nCommitments and Contingencies. From time to time the Company is a defendant or plaintiff in various legal actions that arise in the normal course of business. The\nCompany is also a party to environmental matters, including local, regional, state and federal government clean-up activities at or near locations where the Company currently\nor has in the past conducted business. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of\nreasonably possible losses. A determination of the amount of reserves required for these commitments and contingencies, if any, that would be charged to earnings, includes\nassessing the probability of adverse outcomes and estimating the amount of potential losses. The required reserves, if any, may change in the future due to new developments in\neach matter or changes in circumstances such as a change in settlement strategy. Changes in required reserves could increase or decrease the Company’s earnings in the period\nthe changes are made. (See Notes 15 and 16).\nRestructuring Charges. Restructuring charges are primarily comprised of severance costs, contract and program termination costs, asset impairments and costs of facility\nconsolidation and closure. Restructuring charges are recorded upon approval of a formal management plan and are included in the operating results of the period in which such\nplan is approved and the expense becomes estimable. To estimate restructuring charges, management utilizes assumptions of the number of employees that would be\ninvoluntarily terminated and of future costs to operate and eventually vacate duplicate facilities. Severance and other employee separation costs are accrued when it is probable\nthat benefits will be paid and the amount is reasonably estimable. The rates used in determining severance accruals are based on the Company’s policies and practices and\nnegotiated settlements.\nCash Equivalents. Cash equivalents consist of financial instruments that are readily convertible into cash and have original maturities of three months or ",

The Company classifies its investments in debt and marketable equity securities at the date of acquisition as available-\nfor-sale. Available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive loss, a\ncomponent of stockholders’ equity. Realized gains and losses and declines in the value of available-for-sale securities determined to be other than temporary are included in\nother income (expense), net. The cost of securities sold is determined based on the specific identification method.\nThe Company classifies investments in debt securities with maturities of more than three months at the time of purchase as marketable securities on its consolidated\nbalance sheet. Classification of these securities as current is based on the Company’s intent and belief in its ability to sell these securities and use the proceeds from sale in\noperations within 12 months.\nDerivative Financial Instruments. The Company maintains a foreign currency hedging strategy which uses derivative financial instruments to mitigate the risks\nassociated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This strategy takes into\n \n60\n\n\n \n \nconsideration all of the Company’s consolidated exposures. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\nIn applying its strategy, the Company used foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted expenses denominated in foreign currencies. The Company\ndesignated these contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted expenses, to the extent eligible under the accounting rules, and evaluates hedge effectiveness prospectively and\nretrospectively. As such, the effective portion of the gain or loss on these contracts is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and reclassified to\nearnings in the same line item as the associated forecasted transaction and in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.

Assets held for sale represents components that meet accounting requirements to be classified as held for sale and presented as single asset and\nliability amounts in the Company’s financial statements at lower of carrying value or fair value, less cost to sell. The determination of fair value involves significant judgments\nand assumptions. In determining the fair value less cost to sell, the Company considered factors including, among others, the nature of the sales transaction, the composition of\nassets and/or businesses in the disposal group, current sales prices for comparable assets and/or businesses and negotiations with third party purchaser(s).\nAs of December 26, 2015, the Company’s assets held for sale included in other current assets and liabilities related to assets held for sale included in other current\nliabilities amounted to $183 million and $79 million, respectively. See Note 4 “Equity Interest Purchase Agreement” below, for additional information.\nProduct Warranties. The Company generally warrants that its products sold to its customers will conform to the Company’s approved specifications and be free from\ndefects in material and workmanship under normal use and service for one year. Subject to certain exceptions, the Company also offers a three-year limited warranty to end\nusers for only those central processing unit (CPU) and AMD accelerated processing unit (APU) products that are commonly referred to as “processors in a box” and for certain\nserver CPU products. The Company also offered extended limited warranties to certain customers of “tray” microprocessor products and/or professional graphics products who\nhave written agreements with the Company and target their computer systems at the commercial and/or embedded markets. The Company accrues warranty costs at the time of\nsale of warranted products.\nForeign Currency Translation/Transactions. The functional currency of all of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Assets and liabilities denominated in\nnon-U.S. dollars have been remeasured into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates for monetary assets and liabilities and historical exchange rates for non-monetary assets and\nliabilities. Non-U.S. dollar denominated transactions have been remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those cost of sales and expense\ntransactions related to non-monetary balance sheet amounts, which have been remeasured at historical exchange rates.

Accordingly, amounts granted are initially recorded as a receivable until cash proceeds are received. In the period the grant receivable is recorded,\na current and long-term liability is also recorded which is subsequently amortized as a reduction to cost of sales.\nThe Company also received grants relating to certain research and development projects. These research and development funds are generally recorded as a reduction of\nresearch and development expenses when all conditions and requirements set forth in the underlying grant agreement are met.\nMarketing, Communications and Advertising Expenses. Marketing, communications and advertising expenses for 2015, 2014 and 2013 were approximately $154 million,\n$194 million and $210 million, respectively. Cooperative advertising funding obligations under customer incentive programs are accrued and the costs are recorded upon\nagreement with customers and vendor partners. Cooperative advertising expenses are recorded as marketing, general and administrative expense to the extent the cash\n \n61\n\n\n \n \npaid does not exceed the estimated fair value of the advertising benefit received. Any excess of cash paid over the estimated fair value of the advertising benefit received is\nrecorded as a reduction of revenue.\nNet Loss Per Share. Basic net loss per share is computed based on the weighted-average number of shares outstanding and shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants\nissued by the Company to West Coast Hitech L.P. (WCH), in connection with the GLOBALFOUNDRIES, Inc. (GF) transaction in 2009. On March 7, 2014, the Company\nissued 34,906,166 shares of common stock pursuant to the cashless exercise in full by WCH of its warrant to purchase up to 35,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock\nat an exercise price of $0.01 per share. As a result, the warrant is no longer outstanding. The issuance of the common stock did not have any effect on basic and dilutive\nearnings per share amounts because the full 35,000,000 shares of common stock issuable to WCH had already been included in the denominator for calculating basic and\ndilutive earnings per share for all periods presented.\nDiluted net income per share is computed based on the weighted-average number of shares outstanding plus any potentially dilutive shares outstanding. Potentially\ndilutive shares include stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and shares issuable upon the conversion of convertible debt.\nThe following table sets forth the components of basic and diluted loss per share:\n \n2015\n \n2014\n \n2013\n \n(In millions, except per share amounts)\nNumerator—Net loss:\n \n  \n  \nNumerator for basic and diluted net loss per share\n$\n(660)  $\n(403)  $\n(83)\nDenominator—Weighted-average shares:\n \n  \n  \nDenominator for basic and diluted net loss per share\n783  \n768  \n754 \nNet loss per share:\n \n  \n  \nBasic\n$\n(0.84)  $\n(0.53)  $\n(0.11)\nDiluted\n$\n(0.84)  $\n(0.53)  $",

The Company estimates stock-based compensation cost for stock options at the grant date based on the option’s fair-value as calculated by\nthe lattice-binomial option-pricing model. For restricted stock and restricted stock units, including performance-based restricted stock units (PRSUs), fair value is based on the\nclosing price of the Company’s common\n \n62\n\n\n \n \nstock on the grant date. The Company estimates the grant-date fair value of stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units that involve a market condition using a\nMonte Carlo simulation model. Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period of the applicable award using the straight-line method.\nThe application of the lattice-binomial option-pricing model requires the use of extensive actual employee exercise behavior data and the use of a number of complex\nassumptions including expected volatility of the Company’s common stock, risk-free interest rate and expected dividends. Significant changes in any of these assumptions\ncould materially affect the fair value of stock options granted in the future.\nForfeiture rates are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates in order to derive the\nCompany’s best estimate of awards ultimately expected to vest.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\n \nIncome Tax.

A reclassification will also be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented.\nDisclosure of Going Concern Uncertainties. In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going\nConcern (ASU 2014-15), which provides guidance on management’s responsibility in evaluating whether there is substantial doubt about a company’s ability to continue as a\ngoing concern and to provide related footnote disclosures.

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which creates a single source of revenue\nguidance under U.S. GAAP for all companies in all industries. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is that revenue should be recognized in a manner that depicts the transfer of\npromised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU\n2014-09 defines a five-step process in order to achieve this core principle, which may require the use of judgment and estimates. ASU 2014-09 also requires expanded\nqualitative and quantitative disclosures relating to the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers, including\nsignificant judgments and estimates used. In July 2015, FASB announced a decision to defer the effective date for this ASU.

Accordingly, the Company consolidated GF under applicable accounting rules. As a result of certain GF governance changes, the Company deconsolidated GF and\naccounted for its GF ownership under the equity method of accounting as of December 27, 2009. Following the deconsolidation, GF became the Company’s related party.\nIn the first quarter of 2011, as a result of a contribution to GF by an affiliate of Mubadala Tech and certain GF governance changes noted above, the Company’s\nownership in GF was diluted, and the Company concluded that it no longer had the ability to exercise significant influence over GF. Accordingly, the Company changed the\naccounting for the investment in GF from the equity method to the cost method of accounting and recognized a dilution gain in investee of approximately $492 million. In the\nfourth quarter of 2011, the Company identified indicators of impairment in GF that were deemed other than temporary. The Company performed a valuation analysis and\nrecorded a non-cash impairment charge of $209 million. The carrying value of the Company’s remaining investment in GF after the impairment charge was $278 million as of\nDecember 31, 2011.\nOn March 4, 2012, as partial consideration for certain rights received under a second amendment to the WSA, the Company transferred to GF all of the remaining capital\nstock of GF that the Company owned. In addition, as of March 4, 2012, the Funding Agreement was terminated, and the Company was no longer party to the Shareholders’\nAgreement. As a result of these transactions, the Company no longer owned any GF capital stock as of March 4, 2012.\nGF continues to be a related party of the Company because Mubadala Development Company PJSC (Mubadala) and Mubadala Tech are affiliated with WCH, the\nCompany’s largest stockholder.

This represented a change in circumstance requiring the reassignment of the goodwill to the new reporting units using a relative fair\nvalue approach and an interim goodwill impairment analysis before and after the Company’s reorganization. The Company completed this goodwill impairment analysis during\nthe third quarter of 2014. For purposes of this analysis, the Company’s estimates of fair value were based on the income approach, which estimates the fair value of the\nCompany’s reporting units based on future discounted cash flows. The Company determined that each reporting unit’s estimated fair value exceeded its carrying value,\nindicating that there was no goodwill impairment.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company conducted its annual impairment test of goodwill.  In step one of the impairment test, the Company compared the fair\nvalue of each of the reporting units to its carrying value.  The Company determined that the carrying value of the Computing and Graphics reporting unit exceeded its fair\nvalue, indicating potential goodwill impairment existed based on a combination of factors such as a decline in stock price. Therefore, the Company performed the second step\nof the impairment test, in which the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit on a fair value basis, including any\nunrecognized intangible assets, with any excess representing the implied fair value of goodwill.  The fair value was determined using an income approach, which estimates the\npresent value of future cash flows based on management’s forecast of revenue growth rates and operating margins. Based on this analysis, the implied fair value of the goodwill\nof the Computing and Graphics reporting unit was zero. The Company concluded that the carrying amount of goodwill assigned to the Computing and Graphics segment\nexceeded the implied fair values and recorded an impairment charge of $233 million, which is included in “Goodwill impairment charge” on the Company’s consolidated\nstatement of operations.\nThe Company determined that the estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value of the remaining two reporting units, indicating that there was no goodwill impairment\nwith respect to these reporting units. In connection with completing the goodwill\n \n67\n\n\n \n \nimpairment analysis, the Company reviewed its long-lived tangible and intangible assets within the Computing and Graphics reporting unit under ASC 360, “Accounting for\nthe Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” The Company determined that the forecasted undiscounted cash flows related to these assets or asset groups were in excess\nof their carrying values, and therefore these assets were not impaired.\nIn the fourth quarters of 2015 and 2013, the Company conducted its annual impairment tests of goodwill.

However, the Company does not believe the receivable balance from these customers represents a significant credit risk based on past collection\nexperience, and review of their current credit quality. The Company manages its exposure to customer credit risk through credit limits, credit lines, ongoing monitoring\nprocedures and credit approvals. Furthermore, the Company performs in-depth credit evaluations of all new customers and, at intervals, for existing customers. From this, the\nCompany may require letters of credit, bank or corporate guarantees or advance payments, if deemed necessary.\nThe Company’s existing derivative financial instruments are with large international financial institutions of investment grade credit rating. The Company does not\nbelieve that there is significant risk of nonperformance by these counterparties because the Company monitors their credit rating on an ongoing basis. By using derivative\ninstruments, the Company is subject to credit and market risk. If a counterparty fails to fulfill its performance obligations under a derivative contract, the Company’s credit risk\nwill equal the fair value of the derivative instrument. Generally, when the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, the counterparty owes the Company, thus creating a\nreceivable risk for the Company. Based upon certain factors, including a review of the credit default swap rates for the Company’s counterparties, the Company determined its\ncounterparty credit risk to be immaterial. At December 26, 2015, the Company’s obligations under the contracts exceeded the counterparties’ obligations by $6 million.\nThe Company is dependent on certain equipment and materials from a limited number of suppliers and relies on a limited number of foreign companies to supply the\nmajority of certain types of integrated circuit packages for its internal back-end manufacturing operations. Similarly, certain non-proprietary materials or components such as\nmemory, PCBs, substrates and capacitors used in the manufacture of the Company’s graphics products are currently available from only a limited number of sources.\nInterruption of supply or increased demand in the industry could cause shortages and price increases in various essential materials.

Awards of stock appreciation rights may be granted pursuant to the 2004 Plan. Stock appreciation rights may be granted to employees and\nconsultants. No stock appreciation right may be granted at less than fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant or have a term of over ten years\nfrom the date of grant.

Restricted stock can be granted to any employee, director or consultant. The purchase price for an award of restricted stock is $0.00 per share.\nRestricted Stock Units. Restricted stock units (RSUs) are awards that can be granted to any employee, director or consultant and that obligate the Company to issue a\nspecific number of shares of the Company’s common stock in the future if the vesting terms and conditions are satisfied. The purchase price for the shares is $0.00 per share.\nPerformance-based Restricted Stock Units. Performance-based Restricted Stock Units (PRSUs) can be granted to certain of the Company’s senior executives. The\nperformance metrics can be financial performance, non-financial performance and/or market condition. Each PRSU award reflects a target number of shares (Target Shares)\nthat may be issued to an award recipient before adjusting based on the Company’s financial performance, non-financial performance and/or market conditions.

The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates commensurate with the\nterm of the Company’s employee stock options. The expected dividend yield is zero as the Company does not expect to pay dividends in the future. The expected term of\nemployee stock options represents the weighted-average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding and is a derived output of the lattice-binomial model.\nThe following table summarizes stock option activity, including market-based stock options, and related information:\n \n83\n\n\n \n \n  \n2015\n \n2014\n \n2013\n  \nNumber\nof Shares\n \nWeighted-\nAverage\nExercise\nPrice\n \nNumber\nof Shares\n \nWeighted-\nAverage\nExercise\nPrice\n \nNumber\nof Shares\n \nWeighted-\nAverage\nExercise\nPrice\n \n(In millions, except share price)\nStock options:\n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \nOutstanding at beginning of year\n36  $\n4.78  \n35  $\n5.08  \n38  $\n5.51 \nGranted\n8  $\n2.12  \n8  $\n3.73  \n6  $\n3.63 \nCanceled\n(9)  $\n4.91  \n(4)  $\n7.64  \n(6)  $\n7.73 \nExercised\n(3)  $\n1.61  \n(3)  $\n1.47  \n(3)  $\n1.56 \nOutstanding at end of year\n32  $\n4.44  \n36  $\n4.78  \n35  $\n5.08 \nExercisable at end of year\n21  $\n5.34  \n23  $\n5.28  \n22  $\n5.62 \nAs of December 26, 2015, the weighted-average remaining contractual life of outstanding stock options was 3.38 years and their aggregate intrinsic value was $6 million.\nAs of December 26, 2015, the weighted-average remaining contractual life of exercisable stock options was 1.96 years and their aggregate intrinsic value was $1 million.

The complaint purports to assert claims against the Company and certain individual officers for alleged\nviolations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. The plaintiffs seek to represent a\nproposed class of all persons who purchased or otherwise acquired our common stock during the period April 4, 2011 through October 18, 2012.

Since 1981, the\nCompany has discovered hazardous material releases to the groundwater from former underground tanks and proceeded to investigate and conduct remediation at these three\nsites. The chemicals released into the groundwater were commonly used in the semiconductor industry in the United States in the wafer fabrication process prior to 1979.\nIn 1991, the Company received Final Site Clean-up Requirements Orders from the California Regional Water Quality Control Board relating to the three sites. The\nCompany has entered into settlement agreements with other responsible parties on two of the orders. During the term of such agreements, other parties have agreed to assume\nmost of the foreseeable costs as well as the primary role in conducting remediation activities under the orders. The Company remains responsible for additional costs beyond\nthe scope of the agreements as well as all remaining costs in the event that the other parties do not fulfill their obligations under the settlement agreements.\nTo address anticipated future remediation costs under the orders, the Company has computed and recorded an estimated environmental liability of approximately $4\nmillion and has not recorded any potential insurance recoveries in determining the estimated costs of the cleanup. The progress of future remediation efforts cannot be predicted\nwith certainty and these costs may change.

The 2015 Restructuring Plan involves a reduction of global headcount by approximately 5% and includes\norganizational actions such as outsourcing certain IT services and application development. During 2015, the Company recorded a $37 million restructuring charge, which\nconsisted of approximately $27 million of severance and benefit costs, approximately $1 million of facilities related consolidation charges and approximately $9 million of\nintangible asset related charges associated with the impairment of certain software licenses that have ongoing payment obligations. The 2015 Restructuring Plan resulted in\ntotal cash payments of $14 million in 2015. The Company expects the 2015 Restructuring Plan will likely result in total cash payments of approximately $14 million in 2016.\nThe Company expects actions associated with the 2015 Restructuring Plan to be substantially completed by the end the third quarter of 2016.\nThe following table provides a summary of the restructuring activities during 2015 and the related liabilities recorded in Other current liabilities and Other long-term\nliabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets as of December 26, 2015:\n \nSeverance\n \nand related\n \nbenefits\n \nOther exit\n \nrelated\n \ncosts\n \nTotal\n \n(In millions)\nBalance as of June 27, 2015\n$\n—  $\n—  $\n— \nCharges (reversals), net\n27  \n10  \n37 \nCash payments\n(13)  \n(1)  \n(14)\nNon-cash charges\n—  \n(9)  \n(9)\nBalance as of December 26, 2015\n$\n14  $\n—  $\n14 \n2014 Restructuring Plan\nIn the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company implemented a restructuring plan (2014 Restructuring Plan) designed to improve operating efficiencies. The 2014\nRestructuring Plan involved a reduction of global headcount by approximately 6% and an alignment of its real estate footprint with its reduced headcount. The Company\nrecorded a $57 million restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of 2014, which consisted of $44 million for severance and costs related to the continuation of certain employee\nbenefits, $6 million for contract or program termination costs, $1 million for facilities related costs and $6 million for asset impairments, a non-cash charge. During 2015, the\nCompany recorded a $16 million restructuring charge, which consisted of $5 million non-cash charge related to asset impairments, $2 million for severance and related benefits\nand $9 million for facilities related costs.

The plan primarily involved a workforce reduction of approximately 14% as well as asset impairments and facility consolidations. The Company recorded\nrestructuring expense in the fourth quarter of 2012 of approximately $90 million which was primarily comprised of employee severance. The non-cash portion of the\nrestructuring expense included approximately $4 million of asset impairments. In 2014 and 2013, the Company incurred costs of $3 million and $11 million, respectively,\nrelated to facility consolidation and site closures, which were partially offset by the release of employee severance costs of $2 million and $5 million, respectively. The 2012\nrestructuring plan was substantially completed as of the end of the third quarter of 2013.\nDense Server Systems Business Exit\nAs a part of the Company’s strategy to simplify and sharpen its investment focus, the Company exited the dense server systems business, formerly SeaMicro, in the first\nquarter of 2015. As a result, the Company recorded a charge of $76 million in “Restructuring and other special charges, net” on the Company’s consolidated statements of\noperations during 2015. This charge consisted of an impairment charge of $62 million related to the acquired intangible assets. The Company concluded that the carrying value\nof the acquired intangible assets associated with its dense server systems business was fully impaired as the Company did not have plans to utilize the related freedom fabric\ntechnology in any of its future products nor did it have any plans at that time to monetize the associated intellectual property. In addition, the exit charge consisted of a $7\nmillion non-cash charge related to asset impairments, $4 million of severance and related benefits and $3 million for contract or program termination costs.

We believe that our audit\nprovides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the\npreparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of\nthe assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with\ngenerally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and\ndirectors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets\nthat could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness\nto future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures\nmay deteriorate.\nIn our opinion, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 26, 2015 based on\nthe COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Advanced\nMicro Devices, Inc. as of December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity (deficit),\nand cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 26, 2015 and schedule of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., and our report dated February 18, 2016\nexpressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n \n \n \n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nRedwood City, California\nFebruary 18, 2016\n \n \n \n91\n\n\n \n \n \nSupplementary Financial Information (unaudited)\nThe Company uses a 52 or 53 week fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in December.

Internal control\nover financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal\ncontrol over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements\nmay not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting\nprocess. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining\nadequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company.\nManagement has used the 2013 framework set forth in the report entitled “Internal Control—Integrated Framework” published by the Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission to evaluate the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

In addition, the information is\ngeneral in nature and may not apply to your particular situation, and the Company is not in a position to assure you of any particular result.\nAccordingly, you are advised to seek appropriate professional advice as to how the relevant laws in your country may apply to your situation. If\nyou are a citizen or resident of a country other than the one in which you are currently residing and/or working, transfer employment to another\ncountry after the RSUs are granted to you or are considered a resident of another country for local law purposes, the notifications contained herein\nmay not be applicable to you.\n \n \nARGENTINA\n \nNotifications\n \nSecurities Law Information.

If, however, you have\nsatisfied the ten-day holding obligation, the Argentine bank handling the transaction may still request certain documentation in connection with\nyour request to transfer proceeds into Argentina, including evidence of the sale or dividend payment and proof that no funds were remitted out of\nArgentina to acquire the Shares. If the bank determines that the ten-day rule or any other rule or regulation promulgated by the Argentine Central\nBank has not been satisfied, it will require that 30% of the proceeds be placed in a non-interest bearing dollar denominated mandatory deposit\naccount for a holding period of 365 days.\n \nPlease note that exchange control regulations in Argentina are subject to frequent change.

An integrated circuit (IC) is a\nsemiconductor device that consists of many interconnected transistors on a single chip. Since the invention of the transistor in 1948, improvements in IC process and design\ntechnologies have led to the development of smaller, more complex and more reliable ICs at a lower cost-per-function.\nComputing and Graphics\nThe x86 Microprocessor and Chipset Markets\nCentral Processing Unit (CPU).

The performance of a microprocessor is a critical factor impacting the\nperformance of computing and entertainment platforms, such as desktop PCs, notebooks, tablets and workstations. The principal elements used to measure CPU performance\nare work-per-cycle (or how many instructions are executed per cycle), clock speed (representing the rate at which a CPU’s internal logic operates, measured in units of\ngigahertz, or billions of cycles per second) and power consumption.

As businesses and consumers\nrequire greater performance from their computer systems due to the growth of digital data and increasingly sophisticated software applications, semiconductor companies are\ndesigning and developing multi-core microprocessors, where multiple processor cores are placed on a single die or in a single processor. Multi-core microprocessors offer\nenhanced overall system performance and efficiency because computing tasks can be spread across two or more processing cores, each of which can execute a task at full\nspeed. Multi-core microprocessors can increase performance of a computer system without greatly increasing the total amount of power consumed and the total amount of heat\nemitted. Businesses and consumers also require computer systems with improved power management technology, which helps them to reduce the power consumption of their\ncomputer systems, enable smaller and more portable form factors, and lower total cost of ownership.\nAccelerated Processing Unit (APU) and System-on-Chip (SoC).    Consumers increasingly demand computing devices with improved end-user experience, system\nperformance and energy efficiency. Consumers also continue to demand thinner and lighter mobile devices, with better performance and longer battery life. We believe that a\ncomputing architecture that optimizes the use of its components can provide these improvements.\nAn APU is a processing unit that integrates a CPU and a GPU onto one chip (or one piece of silicon), along with, in some cases, other special-purpose components. This\nintegration enhances system performance by “offloading” selected tasks\n \n3\n\n\n \n \nto the best-suited component (i.e., the CPU or the GPU) to optimize component use, increasing the speed of data flow between the CPU and GPU through shared memory and\nallowing the GPU to function as both a graphics engine and an application accelerator. Having the CPU and GPU on the same chip also typically improves energy efficiency by,\nfor example, eliminating connections between discrete chips.\nA SoC is a type of IC with a CPU, GPU and other components, such as a memory controller and peripheral management, comprising a complete computing system on a\nsingle chip. By combining all of these elements as a SoC, system performance and energy efficiency is improved, similar to an APU.\nHeterogeneous System Architecture (HSA) describes an industry standard that is an overarching design for having combinations of CPU and GPU processor cores\noperate as a unified, integrated engine that shares system responsibilities and resources. We are a founding member of the HSA Foundation, a non-profit organization\nestablished to define and promote this open standar",

Heterogeneous computing allows for the elevation of the GPU to the same\nlevel of the CPU for memory access, queuing and execution - a true “compute core”.  This capability allows software programmers to develop applications to more fully utilize\nthe capabilities of the graphics compute core.\n \n \nGraphics Processing Unit (GPU). A GPU is a programmable logic chip that renders images, animations and video and is also increasingly being used to handle general\ncomputing tasks. GPUs are located in plug-in cards, as a discrete processor or in a chipset on the motherboard, or in the same chip as the CPU. GPUs perform parallel\noperations on data to render images for the screen and are essential to presenting computer generated images on the screen, decoding and rendering animations and video. The\nmore sophisticated the GPU, the higher the resolution and the faster and smoother the motion. GPUs on stand-alone cards or discrete GPUs on the motherboard typically\ninclude their own memory, while GPUs in the chipset or CPU chip share main memory with the CPU.\n \nIn addition to graphics processing, the parallel operation of GPUs are used on multiple sets of data, increasingly used in vector processor for non-graphics applications\nthat require repetitive computations such as supercomputing, deep neural networks, and various embedded applications.\n \nChipset.    A chipset is a generic term referring to a collection of system level components that manage data flow among a microprocessor or microprocessors, memory\nand peripherals (such as CD ROM drives, DVD drives and USB peripherals). Chipsets perform essential logic functions, balance a system’s performance and provide system\ncontrol and power management functions. Some chipsets have graphics capabilities by including an integrated graphics processor (IGP) within the chipset. A chipset with an\nIGP is known as an IGP chipset. IGP chipsets can offer a lower cost, reduced power alternative to a discrete GPU, and are often also used in smaller form factors. Systems that\nare powered by an APU or by a CPU and discrete GPU combination often do not have a chipset and instead use an AMD Controller Hub chip to perform the functions of a\nchipset. As a result, we believe that either an APU and AMD Controller Hub chip combination or a SoC, which already includes a chipset, will eventually replace the market\nfor IGP chipsets.\nOur x86 Microprocessor and Chipset Products\nOur microprocessors are incorporated into computing platforms, which are a collection of technologies that are designed to work together to provide a more complete\ncomputing solution and to enable and advance the computing components.

These servers can run a variety of applications, including business intelligence, enterprise resource planning, customer relationship management and advanced\nscientific or engineering models to solve advanced computational problems in disciplines ranging from financial modeling to weather forecasting to oil and gas exploration.\nServers are also used in cloud computing, which is a computing model where data, applications and services are delivered over the internet or an intranet. Today’s data centers\nrequire new technologies and configuration models to meet the demand driven by the staggering amount of data that needs to be stored, accessed and managed. Servers must be\nefficient, scalable and adaptable to meet the compute characteristics of new and changing workloads.\nEmbedded.    Embedded products address computing needs in PC-adjacent markets, such as industrial control and automation, digital signage, point-of-sale/self-service\nkiosks, medical imaging, set-top box and casino gaming machines as well as enterprise class telecommunications, networking, security, storage systems and thin clients (which\nare computers that serve as an access device on a network). Typically, our embedded products are used in applications that require high to moderate levels of performance,\nwhere key features may include mobility, relatively low power, small form factor, and 24x7 operations. High-performance graphics are increasingly important in many\nembedded systems. Support for Linux®, Windows® and other operating systems as well as for increasingly sophisticated applications are also critical for some customers. Other\nrequirements may include meeting rigid specifications for industrial temperatures, shock, vibration and reliability. The embedded market has moved from developing\nproprietary, custom designs to leveraging industry-standard instruction set architectures and processors as a way to help reduce costs and speed time to market.\nSemi-Custom.

As regulations restricting materials in electronic products continue to increase around the world, there is a risk that the cost, quality and manufacturing\nyields of products that are subject to these restrictions, may be less favorable compared to products that are not subject to such restrictions, or that the transition to compliant\nproducts may not meet customer roadmaps, or produce sudden changes in demand, which may result in excess inventory. A number of jurisdictions including the EU, Australia\nand China are developing or have finalized market entry or public procurement regulations for computers and servers based on ENERGY STAR specifications as well as\nadditional energy consumption limits.

Intel also dominates the computer system platform, which includes core logic chipsets, graphics chips, motherboards and\nother components necessary to assemble a computer system. OEMs that purchase microprocessors for computer systems are highly dependent on Intel, less innovative on their\nown and, to a large extent, are distributors of Intel technology.

The impact of global macro-economic conditions, especially the volatility in the Greater China region contributed\nto a decrease in demand for our products. Additionally, competitive pressures contributed to an overall challenging year. We also experienced reduced demand from our\nOriginal Equipment Manufacturers (“OEM”) customers in advance of the launch of Microsoft Windows® 10. Net revenue for 2015 was approximately $4.0 billion, a decrease\nof 28% compared to 2014 net revenue of $5.5 billion. The decrease in net revenue from 2014 was due to a 42% decrease in Computing and Graphics segment revenue and an\n8% decrease in Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment revenue. Computing and Graphics segment revenue declined year-over-year primarily due to lower client\nprocessor sales. Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment revenue declined year-over-year primarily due to lower server and embedded revenue and lower game\nconsole royalties, partially offset by higher semi-custom SoC sales. Gross margin, as a percentage of net revenue for 2015, was 27% compared to 33% in 2014. Gross margin in\n2015 was adversely impacted by an inventory write-down of $65 million, which was primarily the result of lower anticipated demand for older-generation APUs and a\ntechnology node transition charge of $33 million. The impact of the write-down accounted for approximately two gross margin percentage points and the technology node\ntransition charge accounted for approximately one gross margin percentage point. Gross margin in 2015 was also adversely impacted by a lower proportion of revenue from\nComputing and Gra",

Gross margin in 2014 included a $58 million lower of cost or market inventory adjustment, which accounted for one gross margin percentage point, and\na $27 million benefit from technology licensing revenue, which accounted for less than one gross margin percentage point. Operating loss for 2015 was $481 million compared\nto an operating loss of $155 million in 2014. The decline in operating performance in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to a decrease in net revenue and in gross\nmargin as described above.\nDespite the challenging business environment, we made important changes to our business. During 2015, we continued to focus on introducing a more diverse product\nportfolio. As part of our long-term strategy to deliver great products, we introduced a number of new products in 2015 including, our 6\nth Generation AMD A-Series mobile\nprocessors (formerly codenamed “Carrizo”) in a SoC design and introduced a desktop A-series processor, the AMD A10-7870K APU. We also introduced the A8-7670K APU\ndesigned to support Windows® 10, mainstream workloads and online gaming. With respect to our graphics products, we introduced the new AMD Radeon™ R9 Fury X and\nR9 Fury graphics, the AMD Radeon R7 300 and R9 300 series graphics as well as the AMD Radeon M300 series graphics to reinforce our graphics leadership in both power\nefficiency for notebooks and best-in class performance for desktops. We also expanded our AMD FirePro™ server GPU family by introducing the AMD FirePro S9170,\ndesigned for high performance compute (HPC) environments. The AMD FirePro S9170 is based on second-generation AMD Graphics Core Next (GCN) GPU architecture and\na unified scalable GPU optimized for graphics and compute. We announced the AMD FirePro W4300 graphics card designed for Computer-Aided Design (CAD) for both\nsmall and full-size workstations. We also launched the AMD Radeon R9 Nano, a small-form-factor mini-ITX enthusiast graphics card designed to deliver energy efficiency and\nperformance for ultra-high resolutions, improved virtual reality experiences and smoother gameplay. With respect\n \n34\n\n\n \n \nto our embedded products, we introduced the AMD Embedded R-Series SOC processor designed for digital signage, retail signage, medical imaging, electronic gaming, media\nstorage and communications and networking.\nDuring 2015, we continued to focus on reducing our expenses. Our operating expenses in 2015 decreased to $1.56 billion, from $1.99 billion in 2014. Our operating\nexpenses in 2014 included a goodwill impairment charge of $233 million. We also took steps to simplify our business and better align resources around our priorities and\nbusiness outlook.

The JV Party will acquire 85% of the equity interests in each JV for approximately $371\nmillion and we estimate we will receive approximately $320 million cash, net of taxes and other customary expenses. After closing, JV Party’s affiliates will own 85% of the\nequity interests in each JV while certain of our subsidiaries will own the remaining 15%. The Transaction will result in the JVs providing assembly, testing, marking, packing\nand packaging services (ATMP) to us. We plan to account for our investment in the JVs under the equity method of accounting.\nThe Equity Interest Purchase Agreement also has related agreements including: (i) with respect to the Malaysian Target Company, a Shareholders’ Agreement, and with\nrespect to the Chinese Target Company, a Joint Venture Contract governing the joint venture relationships from and after the Closing, (ii) an IP License Agreement, (iii) a\nManufacturing Services Agreement, (iv) a Transition Services Agreement, and (v) a Trademark License Agreement.\n \n36\n\n\n \n \n \nThe transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2016, pending all regulatory and other approvals.\n \nAs a result of the decision to form the above JVs, the balance sheet as of December 26, 2015, reflects held-for-sale accounting of the ATMP assets and liabilities which\nrequires reclassification of such financial amounts to current assets and current liabilities. We reclassified $183 million to other current assets and $79 million to other current\nliabilities. Asset balances reclassified into other current assets primarily consist of property, plant, and equipment of $110 million, goodwill of $42 million and inventory of $15\nmillion. Liability balances reclassified into other current liabilities primarily consist of accounts payable of $70 million. The balances included in the final gain/(loss)\ncalculation, at closing, are likely to be different due to normal operational activities occurring through the closing date.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in\naccordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that\naffect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis, including those related to our revenue, inventories,\ngoodwill impairments and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the\ncircumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values",

Although actual results have historically been\nreasonably consistent with management’s expectations, the actual results may differ from these estimates or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or\nconditions.\nManagement believes the following critical accounting estimates are the most significant to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most difficult,\nsubjective and complex judgments.\nRevenue Allowances. We record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product sales for estimated future price reductions and other customer\nincentives in the same period that the related revenues are recorded. We base these estimates on actual historical sales returns, historical allowances, historical price reductions,\nmarket activity and other known or anticipated trends and factors. These estimates are subject to management’s judgment and actual provisions could be different from our\nestimates and current provisions, resulting in future adjustments to our revenue and operating results.\nInventory Valuation. At each balance sheet date, we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence based on projected sales outlook. This\nevaluation includes analysis of historical sales levels by product and projections of future demand. These projections assist us in determining the carrying value of our\ninventory. In addition, we write off inventories that we consider obsolete. We adjust the remaining specific inventory balances to approximate the lower of our standard\nmanufacturing cost or market value. Among other factors, management considers forecasted demand in relation to the inventory on hand, competitiveness of product offerings,\nmarket conditions and product life cycles when determining obsolescence and market value. If, in any period, we anticipate future demand or market conditions to be less\nfavorable than our previous estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made. This would\nhave a negative impact on our gross margin in that period. If in any period we are able to sell inventories that were not valued or that had been written down in a previous\nperiod, related revenues would be recorded without any offsetting charge to cost of sales, resulting in a net benefit to our gross margin in that period.\nGoodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized,\nbut rather is tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if there are indicators of impairment present.\n \nWe perform an annual goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year. We evaluate whether goodwill has been impaired at the reporting\nunit level by first determining whether the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than i",

The implied fair value of a reporting unit is determined through the application of one or more valuation\nmodels common to our industry, including the income, market and cost approaches. While market valuation data for comparable companies is gathered and analyzed, we\nbelieve that there has not been sufficient comparability between the peer groups and the specific reporting units to allow for the derivation of reliable indications of value using\na market approach. Therefore, we have ultimately employed the income approach which requires estimates of present value of estimated future cash flows. Cash flow\nprojections are based on management’s estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins, taking into consideration industry and market condition. The key assumptions\nwe have used to determine the fair value of our reporting units includes projected cash flows for the next 10 years and discount rates ranging from 13% to 35% from 2013 to\n2015. The discount rate used is based on the weighted-average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business-specific characteristics and the\n \n37\n\n\n \n \nuncertainty related to the reporting unit’s ability to execute on the projected cash flows. A variance in the discount rate could have a significant impact on the amount of the\ngoodwill impairment charge recorded, if any.\nEstimating the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions\ninclude revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions and the\ndetermination of appropriate comparable publicly-traded companies. In addition, we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to\nindividual reporting units to determine the carrying amount of each reporting unit.\nBased on the results of our annual analysis of goodwill in 2015, each reporting unit’s fair value exceeded its carrying value, ranging from approximately 17% to\napproximately 196%. The Computing and Graphics reporting unit had the lowest excess of fair value over carrying value at 17%, however there is no goodwill within this\nreporting unit. In estimating the fair value of our reporting units, we took into consideration the challenging industry and market trends that existed as of September 27, 2015,\nthe date of the annual goodwill impairment test for each respective reporting unit.\nBased on the results of our annual goodwill impairment analysis in 2014, we determined that the carrying value of the Computing and Graphics reporting unit exceeded\nits estimated fair value and accordingly an impairment charge of $233 million was recorded, which represented the entire goodwill ",

Potential events or circumstance that could reasonably be\nexpected to negatively affect the key assumptions we used in estimating the fair value of our reporting units include adverse changes in our industry, increased competition, an\ninability to successfully introduce new products in the marketplace or to achieve internal forecasts, and a decline in our stock price. If the estimated fair value of our reporting\nunits declines due to any of these factors, we may be required to record future goodwill impairment.\n \nIncome Taxes. In determining taxable income for financial statement reporting purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments\nare applied in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the\nrecognition of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement reporting purposes.\nWe must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our charge to income tax expense, in the\nform of a valuation allowance, for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We consider past performance, future expected taxable income and\nprudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance.\nIn addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our\nuncertain tax positions by the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing authority. If our estimates of these taxes are greater or less than actual results, an additional tax benefit or\ncharge will result.

The 2015 Restructuring Plan involves a reduction of global headcount by approximately 5% and includes organizational\nactions such as outsourcing certain IT services and application development. During 2015, we recorded a $37 million restructuring charge, which consisted of approximately\n$27 million of severance and benefit costs, approximately $1 million of facilities related consolidation charges and approximately $9 million of intangible asset related charges\nassociated with the impairment of certain software licenses that have ongoing payment obligations.

The 2014 Restructuring Plan\ninvolved a reduction of global headcount by approximately 6% and an alignment of our real estate footprint with our reduced headcount. We recorded a $57 million\nrestructuring charge in the fourth quarter of 2014, which consisted of $44 million for severance and costs related to the continuation of certain employee benefits, $6 million for\ncontract or program termination costs, $1 million for facilities related costs and $6 million for asset impairments, a non-cash charge.

We recorded restructuring expense in the fourth\nquarter of 2012 of approximately $90 million, which was primarily comprised of employee severance. The non-cash portion of the restructuring expense included\napproximately $4 million of asset impairments. In 2014 and 2013, we incurred costs of $3 million and $11 million, respectively, related to facility consolidation and site\nclosures, which were partially offset by the release of employee-related severance costs of $2 million and $5 million, respectively.

The amount is recorded under “Restructuring and other special charges,\nnet” on the consolidated statements of operations.\nSale and Leaseback Transactions\nIn September 2013, we sold a light industrial building in Singapore and leased back a portion of the original space.

The Company uses a 52 or 53 week fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in December. Fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 ended December 26, 2015,\nDecember 27, 2014 and December 28, 2013, respectively, each consisted of 52 weeks.\nPrinciples of Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include the Company’s accounts and those of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Upon consolidation, all\nsignificant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated.\nUse of Estimates. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requires\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of commitments and contingencies at the date of the\nfinancial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results are likely to differ from those estimates, and such\ndifferences may be material to the financial statements. Areas where management uses subjective judgment include, but are not limited to, revenue allowances, inventory\nvaluation, valuation and impairment of goodwill, valuation of investments in marketable securities, deferred income taxes and restructuring charges.\nRevenue Recognition. The Company recognizes revenue from products sold directly to customers, including original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), when persuasive\nevidence of an arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, delivery has occurred and collectability is reasonably assured. Estimates of product returns, allowances\nand future price reductions, based on actual historical experience and other known or anticipated trends and factors, are recorded at the time revenue is recognized. The\nCompany sells to distributors under terms allowing the majority of distributors certain rights of return and price protection on unsold merchandise held by them. The distributor\nagreements, which may be cancelled by either party upon specified notice, generally contain a provision for the return of those of the Company’s products that the Company\nhas removed from its price book and that are not more than 12 months older than the manufacturing code date. In addition, some agreements with distributors may contain\nstandard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns. Therefore, the Company is unable to estimate the product returns and pricing when the product is\nsold to the distributors. Accordingly, the Company defers the gross margin resulting from the deferral of both revenue and related product costs from sales to distributors with\nagreements",

Products are sold to distributors at standard published prices that are contained in price books that are broadly provided to the\nCompany’s various distributors. Distributors are then required to pay for these products within the Company’s standard contractual terms, which are typically net 60 days. The\nCompany records allowances for price protection given to distributors and customer rebates in the period of distributor re-sale. The Company determines these allowances\nbased on specific contractual terms with its distributors. Price reductions generally do not result in sales prices that are less than the Company’s product cost. Deferred income\non shipments to distributors is revalued at the end of each period based on the change in inventory units at distributors, latest published prices and latest product costs.\nThe Company records estimated reductions to revenue under distributor and customer incentive programs, including certain cooperative advertising and marketing\npromotions and volume based incentives and special pricing arrangements, at the time the related revenues are recognized. For transactions where the Company reimburses a\ncustomer for a portion of the customer’s cost to perform specific product advertising or marketing and promotional activities, such amounts are recorded as a reduction of\nrevenue unless they qualify for expense recognition. Shipping and handling costs associated with product sales are included in cost of sales.\n \n59\n\n\n \n \nDeferred revenue and related product costs were as follows:\n \nDecember 26, \n \n2015\n \nDecember 27, \n \n2014\n \n(In millions)\nDeferred revenue\n$\n94  $\n130 \nDeferred cost of sales\n(41)  \n(58)\nDeferred income on shipments to distributors\n$\n53  $\n72 \nInventories. Inventories are stated at standard cost adjusted to approximate the lower of actual cost (first-in, first-out method) or market. The Company adjusts inventory\ncarrying value for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand\nand market conditions. The Company fully reserves for inventories and noncancelable purchase orders for inventory deemed obsolete. The Company performs periodic reviews\nof inventory items to identify excess inventories on hand by comparing on-hand balances to anticipated usage using recent historical activity as well as anticipated or forecasted\ndemand. If estimates of customer demand diminish further or market conditions become less favorable than those projected by the Company, additional inventory adjustments\nmay be required.\nGoodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. In accordance with\nAccounting",

          "chunk": "ance with\nAccounting Standards Codification (ASC) 350, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” goodwill is not amortized, but rather is tested for impairment at least annually or more\nfrequently if indicators of impairment present. The Company performs its annual goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year and, if\ncertain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, on an interim basis. The analysis of potential impairment of goodwill requires a two-\nstep process. The first step of the impairment test is to compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. If step one indicates that impairment potentially exists,\nthe second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment, if any. Goodwill impairment exists when the estimated fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value.\nCommitments and Contingencies. From time to time the Company is a defendant or plaintiff in various legal actions that arise in the normal course of business. The\nCompany is also a party to environmental matters, including local, regional, state and federal government clean-up activities at or near locations where the Company currently\nor has in the past conducted business. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of\nreasonably possible losses. A determination of the amount of reserves required for these commitments and contingencies, if any, that would be charged to earnings, includes\nassessing the probability of adverse outcomes and estimating the amount of potential losses. The required reserves, if any, may change in the future due to new developments in\neach matter or changes in circumstances such as a change in settlement strategy. Changes in required reserves could increase or decrease the Company’s earnings in the period\nthe changes are made. (See Notes 15 and 16).\nRestructuring Charges. Restructuring charges are primarily comprised of severance costs, contract and program termination costs, asset impairments and costs of facility\nconsolidation and closure. Restructuring charges are recorded upon approval of a formal management plan and are included in the operating results of the period in which such\nplan is approved and the expense becomes estimable. To estimate restructuring charges, management utilizes assumptions of the number of employees that would be\ninvoluntarily terminated and of future costs to operate and eventually vacate duplicate facilities. Severance and other employee separation costs are accrued when it is probable\nthat benefits will be paid and the amount is reasonably estimable. The rates used in determining severance accruals are based on the Company’s policies and practices and\nnegotiated settlements.\nCash Equivalents. Cash equivalents consist of financial instruments that are readily convertible into cash and have original maturities of three months or ",

The Company classifies its investments in debt and marketable equity securities at the date of acquisition as available-\nfor-sale. Available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive loss, a\ncomponent of stockholders’ equity. Realized gains and losses and declines in the value of available-for-sale securities determined to be other than temporary are included in\nother income (expense), net. The cost of securities sold is determined based on the specific identification method.\nThe Company classifies investments in debt securities with maturities of more than three months at the time of purchase as marketable securities on its consolidated\nbalance sheet. Classification of these securities as current is based on the Company’s intent and belief in its ability to sell these securities and use the proceeds from sale in\noperations within 12 months.\nDerivative Financial Instruments. The Company maintains a foreign currency hedging strategy which uses derivative financial instruments to mitigate the risks\nassociated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This strategy takes into\n \n60\n\n\n \n \nconsideration all of the Company’s consolidated exposures. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\nIn applying its strategy, the Company used foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted expenses denominated in foreign currencies. The Company\ndesignated these contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted expenses, to the extent eligible under the accounting rules, and evaluates hedge effectiveness prospectively and\nretrospectively. As such, the effective portion of the gain or loss on these contracts is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and reclassified to\nearnings in the same line item as the associated forecasted transaction and in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Any ineffective portion is\nimmediately recorded in earnings.\nThe Company also uses, from time to time, foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge recognized foreign currency exposures on the balance sheets of\nvarious subsidiaries. The Company does not designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments. Accordingly, the gain or loss associated with these contracts is\nimmediately recorded in earnings.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment. Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated\nuseful lives of the assets for financial reporting purposes.

Assets held for sale represents components that meet accounting requirements to be classified as held for sale and presented as single asset and\nliability amounts in the Company’s financial statements at lower of carrying value or fair value, less cost to sell. The determination of fair value involves significant judgments\nand assumptions. In determining the fair value less cost to sell, the Company considered factors including, among others, the nature of the sales transaction, the composition of\nassets and/or businesses in the disposal group, current sales prices for comparable assets and/or businesses and negotiations with third party purchaser(s).\nAs of December 26, 2015, the Company’s assets held for sale included in other current assets and liabilities related to assets held for sale included in other current\nliabilities amounted to $183 million and $79 million, respectively. See Note 4 “Equity Interest Purchase Agreement” below, for additional information.\nProduct Warranties. The Company generally warrants that its products sold to its customers will conform to the Company’s approved specifications and be free from\ndefects in material and workmanship under normal use and service for one year. Subject to certain exceptions, the Company also offers a three-year limited warranty to end\nusers for only those central processing unit (CPU) and AMD accelerated processing unit (APU) products that are commonly referred to as “processors in a box” and for certain\nserver CPU products. The Company also offered extended limited warranties to certain customers of “tray” microprocessor products and/or professional graphics products who\nhave written agreements with the Company and target their computer systems at the commercial and/or embedded markets. The Company accrues warranty costs at the time of\nsale of warranted products.\nForeign Currency Translation/Transactions. The functional currency of all of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Assets and liabilities denominated in\nnon-U.S. dollars have been remeasured into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates for monetary assets and liabilities and historical exchange rates for non-monetary assets and\nliabilities. Non-U.S. dollar denominated transactions have been remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those cost of sales and expense\ntransactions related to non-monetary balance sheet amounts, which have been remeasured at historical exchange rates. The gains or losses from foreign currency\nremeasurement are included in earnings.\nForeign Subsidies.

Accordingly, amounts granted are initially recorded as a receivable until cash proceeds are received. In the period the grant receivable is recorded,\na current and long-term liability is also recorded which is subsequently amortized as a reduction to cost of sales.\nThe Company also received grants relating to certain research and development projects. These research and development funds are generally recorded as a reduction of\nresearch and development expenses when all conditions and requirements set forth in the underlying grant agreement are met.\nMarketing, Communications and Advertising Expenses. Marketing, communications and advertising expenses for 2015, 2014 and 2013 were approximately $154 million,\n$194 million and $210 million, respectively. Cooperative advertising funding obligations under customer incentive programs are accrued and the costs are recorded upon\nagreement with customers and vendor partners. Cooperative advertising expenses are recorded as marketing, general and administrative expense to the extent the cash\n \n61\n\n\n \n \npaid does not exceed the estimated fair value of the advertising benefit received. Any excess of cash paid over the estimated fair value of the advertising benefit received is\nrecorded as a reduction of revenue.\nNet Loss Per Share. Basic net loss per share is computed based on the weighted-average number of shares outstanding and shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants\nissued by the Company to West Coast Hitech L.P. (WCH), in connection with the GLOBALFOUNDRIES, Inc. (GF) transaction in 2009. On March 7, 2014, the Company\nissued 34,906,166 shares of common stock pursuant to the cashless exercise in full by WCH of its warrant to purchase up to 35,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock\nat an exercise price of $0.01 per share. As a result, the warrant is no longer outstanding. The issuance of the common stock did not have any effect on basic and dilutive\nearnings per share amounts because the full 35,000,000 shares of common stock issuable to WCH had already been included in the denominator for calculating basic and\ndilutive earnings per share for all periods presented.\nDiluted net income per share is computed based on the weighted-average number of shares outstanding plus any potentially dilutive shares outstanding. Potentially\ndilutive shares include stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and shares issuable upon the conversion of convertible debt.\nThe following table sets forth the components of basic and diluted loss per share:\n \n2015\n \n2014\n \n2013\n \n(In millions, except per share amounts)\nNumerator—Net loss:\n \n  \n  \nNumerator for basic and diluted net loss per share\n$\n(660)  $\n(403)  $\n(83)\nDenominator—Weighted-average shares:\n \n  \n  \nDenominator for basic and diluted net loss per share\n783  \n768  \n754 \nNet loss per share:\n \n  \n  \nBasic\n$\n(0.84)  $\n(0.53)  $\n(0.11)\nDiluted\n$\n(0.84)  $\n(0.53)  $",

The Company estimates stock-based compensation cost for stock options at the grant date based on the option’s fair-value as calculated by\nthe lattice-binomial option-pricing model. For restricted stock and restricted stock units, including performance-based restricted stock units (PRSUs), fair value is based on the\nclosing price of the Company’s common\n \n62\n\n\n \n \nstock on the grant date. The Company estimates the grant-date fair value of stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units that involve a market condition using a\nMonte Carlo simulation model. Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period of the applicable award using the straight-line method.\nThe application of the lattice-binomial option-pricing model requires the use of extensive actual employee exercise behavior data and the use of a number of complex\nassumptions including expected volatility of the Company’s common stock, risk-free interest rate and expected dividends. Significant changes in any of these assumptions\ncould materially affect the fair value of stock options granted in the future.\nForfeiture rates are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates in order to derive the\nCompany’s best estimate of awards ultimately expected to vest.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\n \nIncome Tax.

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which creates a single source of revenue\nguidance under U.S. GAAP for all companies in all industries. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is that revenue should be recognized in a manner that depicts the transfer of\npromised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU\n2014-09 defines a five-step process in order to achieve this core principle, which may require the use of judgment and estimates. ASU 2014-09 also requires expanded\nqualitative and quantitative disclosures relating to the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers, including\nsignificant judgments and estimates used.

Accordingly, the Company consolidated GF under applicable accounting rules. As a result of certain GF governance changes, the Company deconsolidated GF and\naccounted for its GF ownership under the equity method of accounting as of December 27, 2009. Following the deconsolidation, GF became the Company’s related party.\nIn the first quarter of 2011, as a result of a contribution to GF by an affiliate of Mubadala Tech and certain GF governance changes noted above, the Company’s\nownership in GF was diluted, and the Company concluded that it no longer had the ability to exercise significant influence over GF. Accordingly, the Company changed the\naccounting for the investment in GF from the equity method to the cost method of accounting and recognized a dilution gain in investee of approximately $492 million. In the\nfourth quarter of 2011, the Company identified indicators of impairment in GF that were deemed other than temporary. The Company performed a valuation analysis and\nrecorded a non-cash impairment charge of $209 million.

In addition, as of March 4, 2012, the Funding Agreement was terminated, and the Company was no longer party to the Shareholders’\nAgreement. As a result of these transactions, the Company no longer owned any GF capital stock as of March 4, 2012.\nGF continues to be a related party of the Company because Mubadala Development Company PJSC (Mubadala) and Mubadala Tech are affiliated with WCH, the\nCompany’s largest stockholder.

This represented a change in circumstance requiring the reassignment of the goodwill to the new reporting units using a relative fair\nvalue approach and an interim goodwill impairment analysis before and after the Company’s reorganization. The Company completed this goodwill impairment analysis during\nthe third quarter of 2014. For purposes of this analysis, the Company’s estimates of fair value were based on the income approach, which estimates the fair value of the\nCompany’s reporting units based on future discounted cash flows. The Company determined that each reporting unit’s estimated fair value exceeded its carrying value,\nindicating that there was no goodwill impairment.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company conducted its annual impairment test of goodwill.  In step one of the impairment test, the Company compared the fair\nvalue of each of the reporting units to its carrying value.  The Company determined that the carrying value of the Computing and Graphics reporting unit exceeded its fair\nvalue, indicating potential goodwill impairment existed based on a combination of factors such as a decline in stock price. Therefore, the Company performed the second step\nof the impairment test, in which the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit on a fair value basis, including any\nunrecognized intangible assets, with any excess representing the implied fair value of goodwill.  The fair value was determined using an income approach, which estimates the\npresent value of future cash flows based on management’s forecast of revenue growth rates and operating margins. Based on this analysis, the implied fair value of the goodwill\nof the Computing and Graphics reporting unit was zero. The Company concluded that the carrying amount of goodwill assigned to the Computing and Graphics segment\nexceeded the implied fair values and recorded an impairment charge of $233 million, which is included in “Goodwill impairment charge” on the Company’s consolidated\nstatement of operations.\nThe Company determined that the estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value of the remaining two reporting units, indicating that there was no goodwill impairment\nwith respect to these reporting units. In connection with completing the goodwill\n \n67\n\n\n \n \nimpairment analysis, the Company reviewed its long-lived tangible and intangible assets within the Computing and Graphics reporting unit under ASC 360, “Accounting for\nthe Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” The Company determined that the forecasted undiscounted cash flows related to these assets or asset groups were in excess\nof their carrying values, and therefore these assets were not impaired.\nIn the fourth quarters of 2015 and 2013, the Company conducted its annual impairment tests of goodwill.

However, the Company does not believe the receivable balance from these customers represents a significant credit risk based on past collection\nexperience, and review of their current credit quality. The Company manages its exposure to customer credit risk through credit limits, credit lines, ongoing monitoring\nprocedures and credit approvals. Furthermore, the Company performs in-depth credit evaluations of all new customers and, at intervals, for existing customers. From this, the\nCompany may require letters of credit, bank or corporate guarantees or advance payments, if deemed necessary.\nThe Company’s existing derivative financial instruments are with large international financial institutions of investment grade credit rating. The Company does not\nbelieve that there is significant risk of nonperformance by these counterparties because the Company monitors their credit rating on an ongoing basis. By using derivative\ninstruments, the Company is subject to credit and market risk. If a counterparty fails to fulfill its performance obligations under a derivative contract, the Company’s credit risk\nwill equal the fair value of the derivative instrument. Generally, when the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, the counterparty owes the Company, thus creating a\nreceivable risk for the Company. Based upon certain factors, including a review of the credit default swap rates for the Company’s counterparties, the Company determined its\ncounterparty credit risk to be immaterial. At December 26, 2015, the Company’s obligations under the contracts exceeded the counterparties’ obligations by $6 million.\nThe Company is dependent on certain equipment and materials from a limited number of suppliers and relies on a limited number of foreign companies to supply the\nmajority of certain types of integrated circuit packages for its internal back-end manufacturing operations. Similarly, certain non-proprietary materials or components such as\nmemory, PCBs, substrates and capacitors used in the manufacture of the Company’s graphics products are currently available from only a limited number of sources.\nInterruption of supply or increased demand in the industry could cause shortages and price increases in various essential materials.

The exercise price of each option granted under the 2004 Plan must be paid in full\nat the time of the exercise.\nStock Appreciation Rights. Awards of stock appreciation rights may be granted pursuant to the 2004 Plan. Stock appreciation rights may be granted to employees and\nconsultants. No stock appreciation right may be granted at less than fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant or have a term of over ten years\nfrom the date of grant. Upon exercising a stock appreciation right, the holder of such right is entitled to receive payment from the Company in an amount determined by\nmultiplying\n \n82\n\n\n \n \n(i) the difference between the closing price of a share of the Company’s common stock on the date of exercise and the exercise price by (ii) the number of shares with respect to\nwhich the stock appreciation right is exercised.

Restricted stock can be granted to any employee, director or consultant. The purchase price for an award of restricted stock is $0.00 per share.\nRestricted Stock Units. Restricted stock units (RSUs) are awards that can be granted to any employee, director or consultant and that obligate the Company to issue a\nspecific number of shares of the Company’s common stock in the future if the vesting terms and conditions are satisfied. The purchase price for the shares is $0.00 per share.\nPerformance-based Restricted Stock Units. Performance-based Restricted Stock Units (PRSUs) can be granted to certain of the Company’s senior executives. The\nperformance metrics can be financial performance, non-financial performance and/or market condition. Each PRSU award reflects a target number of shares (Target Shares)\nthat may be issued to an award recipient before adjusting based on the Company’s financial performance, non-financial performance and/or market conditions. The actual\nnumber of shares that a grant recipient receives at the end of the period may range from 0% to 250% of the Target Shares granted, depending upon the degree of achievement of\nthe performance target designated by each individual award.\nStock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, RSUs and PRSUs granted after April 29, 2015, generally may not vest in less than one year following the date of\ngrant.\nValuation and Expense Information\nStock-based compensation expense related to employee stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units was allocated in the consolidated statements of operations\nas follows:\n \n2015\n \n2014\n \n2013\n \n(In millions)\nCost of sal",

The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates commensurate with the\nterm of the Company’s employee stock options. The expected dividend yield is zero as the Company does not expect to pay dividends in the future. The expected term of\nemployee stock options represents the weighted-average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding and is a derived output of the lattice-binomial model.\nThe following table summarizes stock option activity, including market-based stock options, and related information:\n \n83\n\n\n \n \n  \n2015\n \n2014\n \n2013\n  \nNumber\nof Shares\n \nWeighted-\nAverage\nExercise\nPrice\n \nNumber\nof Shares\n \nWeighted-\nAverage\nExercise\nPrice\n \nNumber\nof Shares\n \nWeighted-\nAverage\nExercise\nPrice\n \n(In millions, except share price)\nStock options:\n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \nOutstanding at beginning of year\n36  $\n4.78  \n35  $\n5.08  \n38  $\n5.51 \nGranted\n8  $\n2.12  \n8  $\n3.73  \n6  $\n3.63 \nCanceled\n(9)  $\n4.91  \n(4)  $\n7.64  \n(6)  $\n7.73 \nExercised\n(3)  $\n1.61  \n(3)  $\n1.47  \n(3)  $\n1.56 \nOutstanding at end of year\n32  $\n4.44  \n36  $\n4.78  \n35  $\n5.08 \nExercisable at end of year\n21  $\n5.34  \n23  $\n5.28  \n22  $\n5.62 \nAs of December 26, 2015, the weighted-average remaining contractual life of outstanding stock options was 3.38 years and their aggregate intrinsic value was $6 million.\nAs of December 26, 2015, the weighted-average remaining contractual life of exercisable stock options was 1.96 years and their aggregate intrinsic value was $1 million.

The complaint purports to assert claims against the Company and certain individual officers for alleged\nviolations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. The plaintiffs seek to represent a\nproposed class of all persons who purchased or otherwise acquired our common stock during the period April 4, 2011 through October 18, 2012.

Since 1981, the\nCompany has discovered hazardous material releases to the groundwater from former underground tanks and proceeded to investigate and conduct remediation at these three\nsites. The chemicals released into the groundwater were commonly used in the semiconductor industry in the United States in the wafer fabrication process prior to 1979.\nIn 1991, the Company received Final Site Clean-up Requirements Orders from the California Regional Water Quality Control Board relating to the three sites. The\nCompany has entered into settlement agreements with other responsible parties on two of the orders. During the term of such agreements, other parties have agreed to assume\nmost of the foreseeable costs as well as the primary role in conducting remediation activities under the orders. The Company remains responsible for additional costs beyond\nthe scope of the agreements as well as all remaining costs in the event that the other parties do not fulfill their obligations under the settlement agreements.\nTo address anticipated future remediation costs under the orders, the Company has computed and recorded an estimated environmental liability of approximately $4\nmillion and has not recorded any potential insurance recoveries in determining the estimated costs of the cleanup.

The 2015 Restructuring Plan involves a reduction of global headcount by approximately 5% and includes\norganizational actions such as outsourcing certain IT services and application development. During 2015, the Company recorded a $37 million restructuring charge, which\nconsisted of approximately $27 million of severance and benefit costs, approximately $1 million of facilities related consolidation charges and approximately $9 million of\nintangible asset related charges associated with the impairment of certain software licenses that have ongoing payment obligations. The 2015 Restructuring Plan resulted in\ntotal cash payments of $14 million in 2015.

The plan primarily involved a workforce reduction of approximately 14% as well as asset impairments and facility consolidations. The Company recorded\nrestructuring expense in the fourth quarter of 2012 of approximately $90 million which was primarily comprised of employee severance. The non-cash portion of the\nrestructuring expense included approximately $4 million of asset impairments. In 2014 and 2013, the Company incurred costs of $3 million and $11 million, respectively,\nrelated to facility consolidation and site closures, which were partially offset by the release of employee severance costs of $2 million and $5 million, respectively. The 2012\nrestructuring plan was substantially completed as of the end of the third quarter of 2013.\nDense Server Systems Business Exit\nAs a part of the Company’s strategy to simplify and sharpen its investment focus, the Company exited the dense server systems business, formerly SeaMicro, in the first\nquarter of 2015. As a result, the Company recorded a charge of $76 million in “Restructuring and other special charges, net” on the Company’s consolidated statements of\noperations during 2015. This charge consisted of an impairment charge of $62 million related to the acquired intangible assets. The Company concluded that the carrying value\nof the acquired intangible assets associated with its dense server systems business was fully impaired as the Company did not have plans to utilize the related freedom fabric\ntechnology in any of its future products nor did it have any plans at that time to monetize the associated intellectual property. In addition, the exit charge consisted of a $7\nmillion non-cash charge related to asset impairments, $4 million of severance and related benefits and $3 million for contract or program termination costs.

We believe that our audit\nprovides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the\npreparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of\nthe assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with\ngenerally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and\ndirectors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets\nthat could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness\nto future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures\nmay deteriorate.\nIn our opinion, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 26, 2015 based on\nthe COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Advanced\nMicro Devices, Inc. as of December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity (deficit),\nand cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 26, 2015 and schedule of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., and our report dated February 18, 2016\nexpressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n \n \n \n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nRedwood City, California\nFebruary 18, 2016\n \n \n \n91\n\n\n \n \n \nSupplementary Financial Information (unaudited)\nThe Company uses a 52 or 53 week fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in December.

Internal control\nover financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal\ncontrol over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements\nmay not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting\nprocess. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.

However, the statement of cash flows is not included in this excerpt.\n\nTo find the depreciation and amortization (D&A) expense for FY2015, I would typically look for the \"Statement of Cash Flows\" section in the Form 10-K filing, specifically the \"Cash Flows from Operating Activities\" section, where D&A expense is usually reported as a non-cash item.\n\nSince the statement of cash flows is not provided in this excerpt, I cannot extract the D&A expense for FY2015.\n\nHowever, I can suggest that the D&A expense might be reported in the \"Income Statement\" or \"Statement of Operations\" section, but it would not be directly related to the statement of cash flows.\n\nTherefore, my answer is: None",

      "output": "### Analysis\n\n1. **Information Gathered:**\n   - **Total Revenue for FY2015:** There are multiple mentions of the total revenue being \\$3,991 million, which is supported by citations from the P&L statement. However, there are conflicting figures such as \\$4.0 billion and \\$5,506 million, but the most consistent and cited figure is \\$3,991 million.\n   - **Depreciation and Amortization (D&A) Expense for FY2015:** There are conflicting figures for the D&A expense: \\$3 million (amortization of acquired intangible assets), \\$167 million (from the statement of cash flows), and \\$94 million (depreciation alone).\n\n2. **Sufficiency of Information:**\n   - The information is sufficient to calculate the D&A % margin if we can resolve the conflicting D&A expense figures.\n\n3. **Conflicting Information:**\n   - The D&A expense has conflicting figures. The \\$167 million figure is cited from the statement of cash flows, which is typically the most reliable source for this metric. The \\$3 million figure seems to be a specific component of amortization, and the \\$94 million is only for depreciation.\n\n4. **Resolution of Conflicts:**\n   - Given the context and typical financial reporting, the \\$167 million figure from the statement of cash flows is likely the correct total D&A expense for FY2015. This figure is cited as part of the \"Adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash used in operating activities,\" which is a standard section for reporting D&A in cash flow statements.\n\n5. **Calculation of D&A % Margin:**\n   - Using the total revenue of \\$3,991 million and the D&A expense of \\$167 million, the D&A % margin can be calculated as follows:\n     \\[\n     \\text{D\\&A \\% Margin} = \\left(\\frac{\\$167 \\text{ million}}{\\$3,991 \\text{ million}}\\right) \\times 100 \\approx 4.18\\%\n     \\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe D&A % margin for AMD in FY2015 is approximately 4.18%, using the total revenue of \\$3,991 million and the D&A expense of \\$167 million from the statement of cash flows."
