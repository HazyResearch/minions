  "question": "Has AMCOR's quick ratio improved or declined between FY2023 and FY2022? If the quick ratio is not something that a financial analyst would ask about a company like this, then state that and explain why.",
  "predicted_answer": "Due to inconsistent and incomplete data, it is not possible to determine whether AMCOR's quick ratio has improved or declined between FY2023 and FY2022. The quick ratio is a relevant metric for assessing a company's short-term liquidity, but accurate data is essential for its calculation.",
  "ground_truth": [
    "The quick ratio has slightly improved from 0.67 times to 0.69 times between FY 2023 and FY 2022.(3.4% jump)"
