  "question": "Does AMEX have an improving operating margin profile as of 2022? If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then state that and explain why.",
  "predicted_answer": "AMEX's operating margin figures for 2022 are inconsistent, ranging from 14.8% to 95.8%, indicating no clear trend of improvement. Furthermore, the document suggests that operating margin may not be a useful metric for AMEX due to the company's focus on alternative metrics like credit risk management, net interest margin, and regulatory capital ratios, which better capture the complexities of its financial health.",

  "correctness_reasoning": "The predicted answer correctly identifies that operating margin is not a useful metric for AMEX, aligning with the ground truth. It provides additional context by explaining the focus on alternative metrics, which is consistent with the ground truth's implication that performance is not measured through operating margin."
