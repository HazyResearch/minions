--- Question ---
What drove operating margin change as of FY2022 for 3M? If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then please state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
The operating margin for 3M decreased from 22.3% in the previous year to 20.8% in FY2022, influenced by litigation costs, foreign currency impacts, increased raw material and logistics costs, and restructuring charges.

--- Ground Truth ---
['Operating Margin for 3M in FY2022 has decreased by 1.7% primarily due to: \n-Decrease in gross Margin\n-mostly one-off charges including Combat Arms Earplugs litigation, impairment related to exiting PFAS manufacturing, costs related to exiting Russia and divestiture-related restructuring\ncharges']

--- Correctness Evaluation ---
Is correct: True
Confidence: 0.90
Reasoning: The predicted answer correctly identifies the decrease in operating margin and includes key factors such as litigation costs and restructuring charges, which align with the ground truth. Although it mentions additional factors like foreign currency impacts and increased raw material and logistics costs, these do not contradict the ground truth and provide additional context. The numerical change in operating margin is within the 10% tolerance range.
