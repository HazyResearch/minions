--- Question ---
Does Adobe have an improving operating margin profile as of FY2022? If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
Adobe's operating margin for FY2022 was approximately 35.86%. While specific figures for previous years were not consistently available, the operating margin is considered a relevant metric for Adobe as it is used to assess financial performance and is impacted by various business factors such as pricing strategies and security investments.

--- Ground Truth ---
['No the operating margins of Adobe have recently declined from 36.8% in FY 2021 to 34.6% in FY2022. A drop by 2.2% in a year.']

--- Correctness Evaluation ---
Is correct: False
Confidence: 0.80
Reasoning: The predicted answer does not match the ground truth answer in terms of the yes/no stance. The ground truth states that Adobe's operating margin declined, while the predicted answer does not address this decline and provides an incorrect figure for FY2022. The predicted answer also lacks the specific comparison to FY2021, which is crucial for determining whether the operating margin profile is improving or not.
