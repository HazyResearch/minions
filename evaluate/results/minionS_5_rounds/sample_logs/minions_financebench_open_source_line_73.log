--- Question ---
How much has the effective tax rate of Corning changed between FY2021 and FY2022?

--- Predicted Answer ---
The effective tax rate of Corning increased by 1.0 percentage point from FY2021 to FY2022.

--- Ground Truth ---
['The effective tax rate of Corning has changed from 20% in FY2021 to 23% in FY 2022.']

--- Correctness Evaluation ---
Is correct: False
Confidence: 0.80
Reasoning: The ground truth states that the effective tax rate increased by 3 percentage points (from 20% to 23%), while the predicted answer states an increase of 1 percentage point. The predicted answer does not fall within the 10% tolerance range of the ground truth change (3 percentage points), which would be 2.7 to 3.3 percentage points.
