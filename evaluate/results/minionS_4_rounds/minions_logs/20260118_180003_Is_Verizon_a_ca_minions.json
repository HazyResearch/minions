Total length: 494686 characters.: \n\n## Question\nIs Verizon a capital intensive business based on FY 2022 data?\n\n---\n\nPlease provide succinct advice on the critical information we need to extract from the Financial document. Total length: 494686 characters to answer this question. \n\nAlso consider the following constraints:\n- In your response do NOT use numbered lists.\n- Do NOT structure your response as a sequence of steps.\n",
      "output": "To determine if Verizon is a capital-intensive business based on FY 2022 data, focus on extracting key financial metrics related to capital expenditures and asset management. Look for information on Verizon's capital expenditures (CapEx) for the year, as this will indicate the level of investment in physical assets such as infrastructure, technology, and equipment. Compare CapEx to revenue and operating income to assess the proportion of funds allocated to maintaining and expanding capital assets. Additionally, examine the balance sheet for total assets and property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) to understand the scale of Verizon's capital investments. Consider the depreciation and amortization expenses, as these reflect the ongoing costs associated with capital assets. Analyzing these elements will provide insight into whether Verizon operates in a capital-intensive manner."

      "prompt": "# Decomposition Round #1\n\nYou (the supervisor) cannot directly read the document(s). Instead, you can assign small, isolated tasks to a less capable worker model that sees only a single chunk of text at a time. Any cross-chunk or multi-document reasoning must be handled by you.\n\n## Your Job: Write Two Python Functions\n\n### FUNCTION #1: `prepare_jobs(context, prev_job_manifests, prev_job_outputs) -> List[JobManifest]`\n- Break the document(s) into chunks (using the provided chunking function, if needed). Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 12 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`. All **multi-chunk integration** or **global reasoning** is your responsibility here.\n- Return one **aggregated string** suitable for further supervisor inspection.\n\n\n\n## Relevant Pydantic Models\n\nThe following models are already in the global scope. **Do NOT redefine or re-import them.**\n\n### JobManifest Model\n```\nclass JobManifest(BaseModel):\n    chunk: str  # the actual text for the chunk of the document\n    task: str  # the actual task instruction for the small model\n    advice: str  # optional, any additional advice on how to perform the task\n\n    chunk_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    task_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    job_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n\n```\n\n### JobOutput Model\n```\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    citation: Optional[str]\n    answer: Optional[str]\n\n```\n\n## Function Signatures\n```\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        context (List[str]): A list of documents.

The rapid development of new technologies, services and products has \neliminated many of the traditional distinctions among wireless, cable, internet and local and long distance communication \nservices and brought new competitors to our markets. We expect competition to remain intense as traditional and non-traditional \nparticipants seek increased market share. \nWith respect to our wireless connectivity products and services, we compete against other national wireless service providers, \nincluding AT&T Inc. and T-Mobile US, Inc., as well as various regional wireless service providers. We also compete for retail \nactivations with resellers that buy bulk wholesale service from wireless service providers, including Verizon, and resell it to their \ncustomers. Resellers include cable companies, such as Comcast Corporation and Charter Communications, Inc., and others. \nCompetition remains intense as a result of various factors, including high rates of smartphone penetration in the wireless market, \nincreased network investment by our competitors, the development and deployment of new technologies, including 5G, the \nintroduction of new products and services, offerings that include additional bundled premium content, increased levels of \npromotions and service plan discounts, new market entrants, the availability of additional licensed and unlicensed spectrum and \nregulatory changes. In addition, increasing government incentives related to network deployment may enhance the ability of \ncertain of our competitors to compete with us. Competition may also increase as smaller, stand-alone wireless service providers \nmerge or transfer licenses to larger, better capitalized wireless service providers and as MVNOs resell wireless communication \nservices. In addition, DISH Network Corporation has committed to deploy a facilities-based 5G broadband network in each of its \nlicense areas capable of s",

In addition, mobile video and \ndata needs are driving a greater need for wireless backhaul. Network providers, cable companies and niche players are \ncompetitors for this business opportunity. \nRegulatory Trends \nRegulatory Landscape \nVerizon operates in a regulated and highly competitive market, as described above. Some of our competitors are subject to fewer \nregulatory constraints than Verizon. For many services offered by Verizon, the FCC is our primary regulator. The FCC has \njurisdiction over interstate telecommunications services and other matters under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended \n(Communications Act or Act). Other Verizon services are subject to state and local regulation.\nVerizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K                                10 \n\n\nFederal, State and Local Regulation \nWireless Services \nThe FCC regulates several aspects of our wireless operations. Generally, the FCC has jurisdiction over the construction, \noperation, acquisition and transfer of wireless communications systems. All wireless services require use of radio frequency \nspectrum, the assignment and distribution of which is subject to FCC oversight. If demand continues to increase or if new \nspectrum is required for a future generation of technology, we can meet our needs for licensed spectrum by purchasing licenses \nor leasing spectrum from others, or by participating in a competitive bidding process to acquire new spectrum from the FCC. \nThose processes are subject to certain reviews, approvals and potential conditions. \nToday, Verizon holds FCC spectrum licenses that allow it to provide a wide range of mobile and fixed communications services, \nincluding both voice and data services. FCC spectrum licenses typically have a term of 10 years, at which time they are subject \nto renewal. While the FCC has routinely renewed all of Verizon’s wireless licenses, challenges could be raised in the future. If a \nwireless license was revoked or not renewed, Verizon would not be permitted to provide services on the spectrum covered by \nthat license. Some of our licenses require us to comply with so-called \"open access\" FCC regulations, which generally require \nlicensees of particular spectrum to allow customers to use devices and applications of their choice, subject to certain technical \nlimitations. The FCC has also imposed certain specific mandates on wireless carriers, including construction and geographic \ncoverage requirements, technical operatin",

FCC spectrum licenses typically have a term of 10 years, at which time they are subject \nto renewal. While the FCC has routinely renewed all of Verizon’s wireless licenses, challenges could be raised in the future. If a \nwireless license was revoked or not renewed, Verizon would not be permitted to provide services on the spectrum covered by \nthat license. Some of our licenses require us to comply with so-called \"open access\" FCC regulations, which generally require \nlicensees of particular spectrum to allow customers to use devices and applications of their choice, subject to certain technical \nlimitations.

The rapid development of new technologies, services and products has \neliminated many of the traditional distinctions among wireless, cable, internet and local and long distance communication \nservices and brought new competitors to our markets, including other telecommunications companies, cable companies, wireless \nservice providers, satellite providers, technology companies and application and device providers. While these changes have \nenabled us to offer new types of products and services, they have also allowed other providers to broaden the scope of their own \ncompetitive offerings. If we are unable to compete effectively, we could experience lower than expected revenues and earnings. \nWireless service providers are significantly altering the financial relationships with their customers through commercial offers that \nvary service and device pricing, promotions, incentives and levels of service provided – in some cases specifically targeting our \ncustomers and putting pressure on pricing and margins. In addition, the wireless industry’s customer growth rate could moderate \nin comparison to historical growth rates, leading to increased competition for customers.

We are densifying our networks by utilizing small cell technology, in-building solutions \nand distributed antenna systems. Network densification enables us to add capacity to address increasing mobile video \nconsumption and the growing demand for IoT products and services on our 4G LTE and 5G networks. Over the past several \nyears, we have been leading the development of 5G wireless technology industry standards and the ecosystems for fixed and \nmobile 5G wireless services. 5G technology enables higher throughput and lower latency than the 4G LTE technology and allows \nour networks to handle more traffic as the number of internet-connected devices grows. In January 2022, we began deploying C-\nBand spectrum, which has been built out to cover approximately 189 million POPs in the U.S. as of December 31, 2022. We \nexpect to continue deploying C-Band spectrum across the continental U.S. as more and more of the spectrum becomes \navailable for our use. We use low and mid-band spectrum and dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS) technology, to allow 5G service \nto run simultaneously with 4G LTE on multiple spectrum bands. With DSS, whenever customers move outside Verizon’s \nmillimeter wave and C-Band coverage areas, their 5G-enabled devices will remain on 5G technology using the lower spectrum \nbands where this network is available. This allows us to more fully and effectively utilize our current spectrum resources to serve \nboth 4G and 5G customers. \nTo compensate for the shrinking market for traditional copper-based products, we continue to build fiber-based networks \nsupporting data, video and advanced business services - areas where demand for reliable high-speed connections is growing. \nWe are transforming the architecture of our networks into our Intelligent Edge Network, providing improved efficiency and \nvirtualization, increased automation and opportunities for edge computing services that will support our fiber-based and radio \na",

Wireless retail \npostpaid ARPA in each period presented is calculated by dividing retail postpaid service revenue by the average retail postpaid \naccounts in the period. \nWireless retail postpaid accounts are wireless retail customers that are directly served and managed under the Verizon brand \nand use its services as of the end of the period. Accounts include unlimited plans, shared data plans and corporate accounts, as \nwell as legacy single connection plans and multi-connection family plans. A single account may include monthly wireless services \nfor a variety of connected devices. Wireless retail postpaid accounts are calculated by adding retail postpaid new accounts to the \nprior period retail postpaid accounts. \nWireless retail postpaid connections per account is the calculated average number of retail postpaid connections per retail \npostpaid account as of the end of the period. Wireless retail postpaid connections per account is calculated by dividing the total \nnumber of retail postpaid connections by the number of retail postpaid accounts as of the end of the period. \nSegment operating income margin reflects the profitability of the segment as a percentage of revenue. Segment operating \nincome margin is calculated by dividing total segment operating income by total segment operating revenues. \nSegment earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Segment EBITDA), which is presented below, is a non-\nGAAP measure and does not purport to be an alternative to operating income (loss) as a measure of operating performance. We \nbelieve this measure is useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating operating \nprofitability on a more variable cost basis as it excludes the depreciation and amortization expense related primarily to capital \nexpenditures and acquisitions that occurred in prior years, as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to our \ncompetitors. Segment EBITDA is calculated by adding back depreciation and amortization expense to segment operating income \n(loss). Segment EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing Segment EBITDA by total segment operating revenues. See Note 13",

For device payment plan \nagreement receivables, we record bad debt expense based on a default and loss calculation using our proprietary loss model. \nThe expected loss rate is determined based on customer credit scores and other qualitative factors as noted above. The loss \nrate is assigned individually on a customer by customer basis and the custom credit scores are then aggregated by vintage and \nused in our proprietary loss model to calculate the weighted-average loss rate used for determining the allowance balance. The \nweighted-average expected loss rate increased 0.44% at December 31, 2022 as compared to at December 31, 2021. We expect \nthat an increase or decrease of 0.25% in the weighted-average loss rate would result in a change of $111 million in the \nallowance. \nWe monitor the collectability of our wireless service receivables as one overall pool. Wireline service receivables are \ndisaggregated and pooled by the following customer groups: consumer, small and medium business, global enterprise, public \nsector and wholesale. For wireless service receivables and wireline consumer and small and medium business receivables, the \nallowance is calculated based on a 12 month rolling average write-off balance multiplied by the average life-cycle of an account \nfrom billing to write-off. The risk of loss is assessed over the contractual life of the receivables and we adjust the historical loss \namounts for current and future conditions based on management’s qualitative considerations. For global enterprise, public sector \nand wholesale wireline receivables, the allowance for credit losses is based on historical write-off experience and individual \ncustomer credit risk, as applicable. We consider multiple factors in determining the allowance as discussed above. \nIf there is a deterioration of our customers’ financial condition or if future actual default rates on receivables in general differ from \nthose currently anticipated, we may have to adjust our allowance for credit losses, which would affect earnings in the period the \nadjustments are made. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. \nAcquisitions and Divestitures \nSpectrum License Transactions \nFrom time to time, we enter into agreements to buy, sell or exchange spectrum licenses.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk \nWe are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of business, including the impact of interest rate changes, \nforeign currency exchange rate fluctuations, changes in investment, equity and commodity prices and changes in corporate tax \nrates. We employ risk management strategies, which may include the use of a variety of derivatives including cross currency \nswaps, forward starting interest rate swaps, interest rate swaps, interest rate caps, treasury rate locks and foreign exchange \nforwards. We do not hold derivatives for trading purposes. \nIt is our general policy to enter into interest rate, foreign currency and other derivative transactions only to the extent necessary \nto achieve our desired objectives in optimizing exposure to various market risks. Our objectives include maintaining a mix of fixed \nand variable rate debt to lower borrowing costs within reasonable risk parameters and to protect against earnings and cash flow \nvolatility resulting from changes in market conditions. We do not hedge our market risk exposure in a manner that would \ncompletely eliminate the effect of changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates on our earnings. \nCounterparties to our derivative contracts are major financial institutions with whom we have negotiated derivatives agreements \n(ISDA master agreements) and credit support annex (CSA) agreements which provide rules for collateral exchange.

At December 31, 2022, our primary translation exposure \nwas to the British Pound Sterling, Euro and Australian Dollar. \nCross Currency Swaps \nWe have entered into cross currency swaps to exchange our British Pound Sterling, Euro, Swiss Franc, Canadian Dollar and \nAustralian Dollar-denominated cash flows into U.S. dollars and to fix our cash payments in U.S. dollars, as well as to mitigate the \nimpact of foreign currency transaction gains or losses. On March 31, 2022, we voluntarily elected to de-designate our cross \ncurrency swaps previously designated as cash flow hedges and re-designated the swaps as fair value hedges. Subsequently \nexecuted cross currency swaps are also designated as fair value hedges. The fair value of the asset of these contracts was \n$305 million and $589 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the fair value of \nthe liability of these contracts was $3.6 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the total notional \namount of the cross currency swaps was $35.0 billion and $32.5 billion, respectively. \nForeign Exchange Forwards \nWe also have foreign exchange forwards which we use as economic hedges but for which we have elected not to apply hedge \naccounting. We enter into British Pound Sterling and Euro foreign exchange forwards to mitigate our foreign exchange rate risk \nrelated to non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities of international subsidiaries. \nAt December 31, 2022, the fair value of the asset and liability of these contracts was insignificant. At December 31, 2021, the fair \nvalue of the asset of these contracts was insignificant and there was no amount related to the liability of these contracts. At \nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, the total notional amount of the foreign exchange forwards was $920 million and $932 million, \nrespectively.\nVerizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K                                50 \n\n\n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \nItem 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data \nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm \nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Verizon Communications Inc.: \nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \nWe have audited Verizon Communications Inc. and subsidiaries’ (Verizon) internal control over financial reporting as of \nDecember 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of \nSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (201",

Property, plant and equipment are generally depreciated on a straight-line \nbasis. \nLeasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated life of the improvement or the remaining term of the \nrelated lease, calculated from the time the asset was placed in service. \nWhen depreciable assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the ",

Our \nqualitative impairment assessment indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our Consumer reporting unit \nexceeded its carrying value and, therefore, did not result in an impairment. \nWe performed a quantitative impairment assessment for our Business reporting unit during the fourth quarter of 2022. We \napplied a combination of a market approach and a discounted cash flow method, as a form of the income approach, reflecting \ncurrent assumptions and inputs, including our revised projections, discount rate and expected growth rates, which indicated that \nthe fair value of our Business reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and, therefore, did not result in an impairment. We do not \nanticipate reasonable changes in significant estimates to change the outcome of the quantitative impairment assessment. \nHowever, as a result of our 2022 goodwill assessment, management believes there is an increasing risk that our Business \nreporting unit may be required to recognize an impairment charge in the future. \nA projected sustained decline in the reporting unit's revenues and earnings could have a significant negative impact on its fair \nvalue and may result in impairment charges. Such a decline could be driven by, among other things: (1) decreases in sales \nvolumes or long-term growth rate as a result of competitive pressures or other factors; or (2) the inability to achieve or delays in \nachieving the goals in strategic initiatives. Also, adverse changes to macroeconomic factors, such as increases in long-term \ninterest rates, would also negatively impact the fair value of the reporting unit. \nWe performed quantitative impairment assessments for both our Consumer and Business reporting units in 2021. We applied a \ncombination of a market approach and a discounted cash flow method, as a form of the income approach, which indicated that \nthe fair values for our Consumer and Business reporting units exceeded their carrying values and, therefore, did not result in an \nimpairment.\n   73 \n \n            Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n\n\nOther Intangible Assets \nThe following table displays the composition of Other intangible assets, net as well as the respective amortization period: \n(dollars in millions) \n2022\n2021 \nAt December 31, \nGross \nA",

Borrowings under certain \nof these facilities are amortized semi-annually in equal installments up to the applicable maturity dates. Maturities reflect \nmaturity dates of principal amounts outstanding. Any amounts borrowed under these facilities and subsequently repaid cannot \nbe reborrowed. \nIn January 2023, we submitted an irrevocable request to borrow approximately $515 million from funds available under our \nexport credit facilities in March 2023. \nNon-Cash Transactions \nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we financed, primarily through alternative financing arrangements, \nthe purchase of approximately $832 million, $461 million, and $1.7 billion, respectively, of long-lived assets consisting primarily of \nnetwork equipment. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, relating to these financing \narrangements, including those entered into in prior years and liabilities assumed through acquisitions, remained outstanding. \nThese purchases are non-cash financing activities and therefore are not reflected within Capital expenditures in our consolidated \nstatements of cash flows. \nNet Debt Extinguishment Losses \nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recorded net debt extinguishment losses of $1.1 billion, \n$3.6 billion and $121 million, respectively. The net losses are recorded in Other income (expense), net in our consolidated \nstatements of income. The total losses are reflected within Other, net cash flow from operating activities and the portion of the \nlosses representing cash payments are reflected within Other, net cash flow from financing activities in our consolidated \nstatements of cash flows.  \nGuarantees \nWe guarantee the debentures of our operating telephone company subsidiaries.

The effective income tax rate for the twelve months ended \nDecember 31, 2022 was comparable to the similar period in 2021. The decrease in the provision for income taxes was primarily \ndue to the decrease in income before income taxes in the current period. \nThe effective income tax rate for 2021 was 23.1% compared to 23.4% for 2020. The decrease in the effective income tax rate \nwas primarily due to the sale of Verizon Media in 2021, partially offset by the non-recurring tax benefit recognized in 2020 from a \nseries of legal entity restructurings. The increase in the provision for income taxes was primarily due to the increase in income \nbefore income taxes in 2021. \nThe amounts of cash taxes paid by Verizon are as follows: \n(dollars in millions) \nYears Ended December 31,\n2022\n2021\n2020 \nIncome taxes, net of amounts refunded\n$ \n2,736 \n$ \n3,040 \n$ \n2,725 \nEmployment taxes\n1,245 \n1,225 \n618 \nProperty and other taxes\n1,959 \n1,756 \n2,093 \nTotal\n$ \n5,940 \n$ \n6,021 \n$ \n5,436 \n \n \n \n \n \n \nVerizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K                                98 \n\n\nDeferred Tax Assets and Liabilities \nDeferred taxes arise because of differences in the book and tax bases of certain assets and liabilities.

These cases have progressed to various \nstages and a small number may go to trial in the coming 12 months if they are not otherwise resolved. \nIn connection with the execution of agreements for the sales of businesses and investments, Verizon ordinarily provides \nrepresentations and warranties to the purchasers pertaining to a variety of nonfinancial matters, such as ownership of the \nsecurities being sold, as well as indemnity from certain financial losses. From time to time, counterparties may make claims \nunder these provisions, and Verizon will seek to defend against those claims and resolve them in the ordinary course of \nbusiness. \nAs of December 31, 2022, letters of credit totaling approximately $834 million, which were executed in the normal course of \nbusiness and support several financing arrangements and payment obligations to third parties, were outstanding. \nDuring 2022, Verizon entered into four renewable energy purchase agreements (REPAs) with third parties, in addition to 20 \nsigned in previous years. Each of the REPAs is based on the expected operation of a renewable energy-generating facility and \nhas a fixed price term of 12 to 18 years from the commencement of the facility's entry into commercial operation.

      "output": "Based on the collected outputs, we have gathered the following information:\n\n1. **Capital Expenditures (CapEx):** Verizon's total capital expenditures for FY 2022 were $23.1 billion, with $6.2 billion specifically related to C-Band investments. This indicates a significant investment in infrastructure and technology.\n\n2. **Total Assets and PP&E:** The total assets for FY 2022 are reported as $379,680 million. However, specific details about the property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) are not consistently mentioned across the outputs.\n\n3. **Depreciation and Amortization Expenses:** The depreciation and amortization expenses for FY 2022 are reported as $17,099 million, which includes $826 million in amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Sufficiency of Information:** The information gathered is sufficient to determine whether Verizon is a capital-intensive business. The significant capital expenditures ($23.1 billion) and the large total assets ($379,680 million) suggest that Verizon invests heavily in maintaining and expanding its infrastructure, which is characteristic of a capital-intensive business.\n\n- **Calculation/Derivation:** To assess capital intensity, we can compare the capital expenditures to revenue and operating income, but these figures are not provided in the outputs. However, the sheer size of the CapEx and total assets already indicates a high level of capital intensity.\n\n- **Missing Information:** While we have sufficient data to make a general assessment, specific revenue and operating income figures would provide a more precise calculation of capital intensity ratios.\n\n- **Conflicting Answers:** There are no significant conflicting answers regarding the key figures of CapEx and total assets. The citations consistently support the reported figures.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the available data, Verizon can be considered a capital-intensive business due to its substantial capital expenditures and large asset base in FY 2022."
