--- Question ---
Does AMD have a reasonably healthy liquidity profile based on its quick ratio for FY22? If the quick ratio is not relevant to measure liquidity, please state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
Based on the available information, AMD appears to have a reasonably healthy liquidity profile for FY22. Although the quick ratio cannot be calculated due to incomplete data on current liabilities, AMD's liquidity position is supported by $5.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, along with a $3.0 billion revolving credit facility.

--- Ground Truth ---
['Yes. The quick ratio is 1.57, calculated as (cash and cash equivalents+Short term investments+Accounts receivable, net+receivables from related parties)/ (current liabilities).']

--- Correctness Evaluation ---
Is correct: False
Confidence: 0.80
Reasoning: The predicted answer does not provide a calculated quick ratio, which is essential for evaluating liquidity based on the question. The ground truth answer provides a specific quick ratio of 1.57, indicating a healthy liquidity profile. The predicted answer instead relies on cash and credit facilities without addressing the quick ratio, which is the focus of the question.
