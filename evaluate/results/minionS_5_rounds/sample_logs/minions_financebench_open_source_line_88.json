  "question": "Roughly how many times has JnJ sold its inventory in FY2022? Calculate inventory turnover ratio for FY2022; if conventional inventory management is not meaningful for the company then state that and explain why.",
  "predicted_answer": "The inventory turnover ratio for JnJ in FY2022 cannot be determined due to the lack of explicit COGS data. The ending inventory was reported as $12,483 million, but without COGS, the turnover ratio cannot be calculated. Conventional inventory management may not be meaningful for JnJ due to its complex business model, which includes a diverse product portfolio and global operations.",
  "ground_truth": [
    "JnJ sold its inventory 2.7 times in FY2022."

  "correctness_reasoning": "The predicted answer states that the inventory turnover ratio cannot be determined due to lack of COGS data, while the ground truth provides a specific turnover ratio of 2.7 times. The predicted answer does not align with the ground truth, which indicates that the turnover ratio can indeed be calculated. Additionally, the explanation about conventional inventory management not being meaningful is not directly relevant to the calculation of the inventory turnover ratio."
