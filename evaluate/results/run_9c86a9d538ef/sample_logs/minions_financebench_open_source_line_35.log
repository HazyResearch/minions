--- Question ---
What drove operating margin change as of the FY22 for AMD? If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then please state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
The operating margin change was driven by a combination of increased revenue offset by higher costs, particularly due to the Xilinx acquisition, competitive pressures from Intel, and macroeconomic challenges. The operating margin is a useful metric for AMD as it highlights the impact of strategic decisions and market conditions on profitability.

--- Ground Truth ---
["The decrease in AMD's operating income was primarily driven by amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition"]
