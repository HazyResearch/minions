--- Question ---
What drove gross margin change as of FY2022 for JnJ? If gross margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then please state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
The gross margin change for Johnson & Johnson (JnJ) in FY2022 was driven by several factors. Key influences included patent expirations, which often lead to reduced sales due to increased competition from generic products. Pricing pressures from healthcare cost containment trends and government policies also played a role. Additionally, the company faced one-time costs related to exiting COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing, as well as commodity inflation impacting the MedTech and Consumer Health segments. Management attempted to counteract these pressures through cost reduction programs and productivity improvements, although specific quantitative impacts of these efforts were not detailed.

--- Ground Truth ---
['For FY22, JnJ had changes in gross margin due to: One-time COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing exit related costs, Currency impacts in the Pharmaceutical segment, Commodity inflation in the MedTech and Consumer Health segments, partially offset by Supply chain benefits in the Consumer Health segment.']
