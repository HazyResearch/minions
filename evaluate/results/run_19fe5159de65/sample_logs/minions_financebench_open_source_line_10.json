  "correctness_reasoning": "The predicted answer matches the ground truth answer exactly. Both state that the 3-year average of capex as a percentage of revenue for Activision Blizzard from FY2017 to FY2019 is 1.9%. This falls within the 10% tolerance rule, which would allow for a range of 1.71% to 2.09% if there were any discrepancies. Therefore, the predicted answer is correct."
