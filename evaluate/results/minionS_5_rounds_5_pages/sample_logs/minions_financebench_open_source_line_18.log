['-0.02']

--- Correctness Evaluation ---
Is correct: False
Confidence: 1.00
Reasoning: The ground truth answer is -0.02, while the predicted answer is 3.55%. The 10% tolerance rule allows for a range of -0.022 to -0.018 for the ground truth answer. The predicted answer of 3.55% is far outside this range, indicating a significant discrepancy. Therefore, the predicted answer is incorrect.
