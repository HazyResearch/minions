      "output": "To calculate Lockheed Martin's FY2020 asset turnover ratio, focus on extracting specific financial data from the balance sheet and the profit and loss (P&L) statement. You need the total revenue for FY2020, which is typically found in the P&L statement. Additionally, gather the total assets for both FY2019 and FY2020 from the balance sheets of each respective year. The asset turnover ratio is calculated by dividing the FY2020 revenue by the average of the total assets from FY2019 and FY2020. To find the average total assets, add the total assets from FY2019 and FY2020 and divide by two. Once you have these figures, perform the division and round the result to two decimal places to obtain the asset turnover ratio."

Instead, you can assign small, isolated tasks to a less capable worker model that sees only a single chunk of text at a time. Any cross-chunk or multi-document reasoning must be handled by you.\n\n## Your Job: Write Two Python Functions\n\n### FUNCTION #1: `prepare_jobs(context, prev_job_manifests, prev_job_outputs) -> List[JobManifest]`\n- Break the document(s) into chunks (using the provided chunking function, if needed). Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 12 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`. All **multi-chunk integration** or **global reasoning** is your responsibility here.\n- Return one **aggregated string** suitable for further supervisor inspection.\n\n\n\n## Relevant Pydantic Models\n\nThe following models are already in the global scope. **Do NOT redefine or re-import them.**\n\n### JobManifest Model\n```\nclass JobManifest(BaseModel):\n    chunk: str  # the actual text for the chunk of the document\n    task: str  # the actual task instruction for the small model\n    advice: str  # optional, any additional advice on how to perform the task\n\n    chunk_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    task_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    job_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n\n```\n\n### JobOutput Model\n```\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    citation: Optional[str]\n    answer: Optional[str]\n\n```\n\n## Function Signatures\n```\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        context (List[str]): A list of documents.

Changes within the industry we operate in, such\nas vertical integration by our peers, could negatively impact us. We often form teams with our competitors in efforts to provide our customers with the best\nmix of capabilities to address specific requirements. In some areas of our business, customer requirements are changing to encourage expanded\ncompetition. Principal factors of competition include the value of our products and services to the customer; technical and management capability; the\nability to develop and implement complex, integrated system architectures; total cost of ownership; our demonstrated ability to execute and perform against\ncontract requirements; and our ability to provide timely and cost effective solutions. Technological advances in such areas as additive manufacturing, data\nanalytics, digital engineering, artificial intelligence, advanced materials, autonomy and robotics, and new business models such as commercial access to\nspace are enabling new factors of competition for both traditional and non-traditional competitors.\nThe competition for international sales is generally subject to U.S. Government stipulations (e.g., export restrictions, market access, technology\ntransfer, industrial cooperation and contracting practices). We may compete against U.S. and non-U.S. companies (or teams) for contract awards by\ninternational governments. International competitions also may be subject to different laws or contracting practices of international governments that may\naffect how we structure our bid for the procurement. In many international procurements, the purchasing government’s relationship with the U.S. and its\nindustrial cooperation programs are important factors in determining the outcome of a competition. It is common for international customers to require\ncontractors to comply with their industrial cooperation regulations, sometimes referred to as offset requirements, and we have entered into foreign offset\nagreements as part of securing some international business.

Industrial development agreements generally extend over several years and obligate the contractor to\nperform certain commitments, which may include in-country purchases, technology transfers, local manufacturing support, consulting support to in-country\nprojects, investments in joint ventures and financial support projects. Expectations as to offset commitments can be substantial, including high-value\ncontent, and may exceed existing local technical capability. Failure to meet these commitments, which can be subjective and outside of our control, may\nresult in significant penalties, and could lead to a reduction in sales to a country. Furthermore, certain of our existing industrial development agreements are\ndependent upon the successful operation of joint ventures that we do not control and involve products and services that are outside of our core business,\nwhich may increase the risk that we fail to meet our industrial cooperation agreements, expose us to compliance risks of the joint venture and impair our\nability to recover our investment.

Question to answer:\nWe need to calculate a reasonable approximation (or exact number if possible) of a financial metric. Basing your judgment by information plainly provided in the balance sheet and the P&L statement, what is Lockheed Martin's FY2020 asset turnover ratio? Asset turnover ratio is defined as: FY2020 revenue / (average total assets between FY2019 and FY2020). Round your answer to two decimal places.\n\n2.

However, we are missing several critical pieces of information to calculate the asset turnover ratio for Lockheed Martin's FY2020:\n\n1. **FY2020 Revenue**: We need the total revenue for FY2020 from the P&L statement to serve as the numerator in the asset turnover ratio formula.\n\n2. **FY2020 Total Assets**: We need the total assets for FY2020 to calculate the average total assets between FY2019 and FY2020.\n\nWithout the FY2020 revenue and total assets, we cannot compute the average total assets or the asset turnover ratio. Once we have these missing pieces, we would calculate the average total assets by adding the total assets for FY2019 and FY2020 and dividing by two. Then, we would divide the FY2020 revenue by this average to get the asset turnover ratio, rounding the result to two decimal places. \n\nTo proceed, we need to extract the FY2020 revenue and total assets from the relevant sections of the financial documents."

Each task is focused on a single piece of information, such as total revenue or total assets for a specific year. The `transform_outputs` function filters and aggregates the outputs from the small language models, ensuring that only relevant and non-empty answers are included in the final aggregated string. This approach allows for efficient extraction and aggregation of the necessary financial data to calculate the asset turnover ratio."

In 2020, 74% of our $65.4 billion in net sales were from the U.S.\nGovernment, either as a prime contractor or as a subcontractor (including 64% from the Department of Defense (DoD)), 25% were from international\ncustomers (including foreign military sales (FMS) contracted through the U.S. Government) and 1% were from U.S. commercial and other customers. Our\nmain areas of focus are in defense, space, intelligence, homeland security and information technology, including cybersecurity.\nWe operate in an environment characterized by both complexity in global security and continuing economic pressures in the U.S. and globally. A\nsignificant component of our strategy in this environment is to focus on program execution, improving the quality and predictability of the delivery of our\nproducts and services, and placing security capability quickly into the hands of our U.S. and international customers at affordable prices. Recognizing that\nour customers are resource constrained, we are endeavoring to develop and extend our portfolio domestically in a disciplined manner with a focus on\nadjacent markets close to our core capabilities, as well as growing our international sales. We continue to focus on affordability initiatives. We also expect\nto continue to innovate and invest in technologies to fulfill new mission requirements for our customers, including through acquisitions, and invest in our\npeople so that we have the technical skills necessary to succeed.\nWe operate in four business segments: Aeronautics, Missiles and Fire Control (MFC), Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) and Space.

Changes within the industry we operate in, such\nas vertical integration by our peers, could negatively impact us. We often form teams with our competitors in efforts to provide our customers with the best\nmix of capabilities to address specific requirements. In some areas of our business, customer requirements are changing to encourage expanded\ncompetition. Principal factors of competition include the value of our products and services to the customer; technical and management capability; the\nability to develop and implement complex, integrated system architectures; total cost of ownership; our demonstrated ability to execute and perform against\ncontract requirements; and our ability to provide timely and cost effective solutions. Technological advances in such areas as additive manufacturing, data\nanalytics, digital engineering, artificial intelligence, advanced materials, autonomy and robotics, and new business models such as commercial access to\nspace are enabling new factors of competition for both traditional and non-traditional competitors.\nThe competition for international sales is generally subject to U.S. Government stipulations (e.g., export restrictions, market access, technology\ntransfer, industrial cooperation and contracting practices). We may compete against U.S. and non-U.S. companies (or teams) for contract awards by\ninternational governments. International competitions also may be subject to different laws or contracting practices of international governments that may\naffect how we structure our bid for the procurement. In many international procurements, the purchasing government’s relationship with the U.S. and its\nindustrial cooperation programs are important factors in determining the outcome of a competition. It is common for international customers to require\ncontractors to comply with their industrial cooperation regulations, sometimes referred to as offset requirements, and we have entered into foreign offset\nagreements as part of securing some international business.

Critical to attracting and retaining top talent is employee satisfaction, and we regularly conduct employee\nengagement surveys to gauge employee satisfaction and to understand the effectiveness of our employee and compensation programs. We attract and\nreward our employees by providing market competitive compensation and benefit practices, including incentives and recognition plans that extend to all\nlevels in our organization. In addition, we invest in the development of our employees through trainings, apprenticeship programs, leadership development\nplans and offering tuition assistance ",

As part of this program, we track employee health and\nsafety measures, including quarterly and yearly targets related to the number of injury and illness incidents that occur, those incidents that result in days\nlost, and the number of days lost due to workplace injuries. During 2020, these metrics were negatively impacted by the absence from work and delays in\nthe return to work related to the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to COVID-19, we took action to protect our employees’ safety and health, including by\nequipping employees with personal protective equipment, establishing minimum staffing and social distancing policies, sanitizing workspaces more\nfrequently, adopting alternate work schedules and instituting other measures aimed at minimizing the transmission of COVID-19 while sustaining\nproduction and related services. In addition, we have implemented a flexible teleworking policy for employees who can meet our customer commitments\nremotely, and a significant portion of our workforce began teleworking in mid-March 2020 and were continuing to telework as of December 31, 2020.

We expect to continue to derive most of our\nsales from work performed under U.S. Government contracts. Those contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of Congressional\nappropriations. Congress usually appropriates funds on a fiscal year (FY) basis even though contract performance may extend over many years.\nConsequently, contracts are often partially funded initially and additional funds are committed only as Congress makes further appropriations. If we incur\ncosts in excess of funds obligated on a contract, we may be at risk for reimbursement of those costs unless and until additional funds are obligated to the\ncontract.\nThe F-35 program, which consists of multiple development, production and sustainment contracts, is our largest program. It represented 28% of our\ntotal net sales in 2020. A decision by the U.S. Government or other governments to cut spending on this program or reduce or delay planned orders would\nhave an adverse impact on our business and results of operations. Given the size and complexity of the F-35 program, we anticipate that there will be\ncontinual reviews related to aircraft performance, program schedule, cost, and requirements as part of the DoD, Congressional, and international partners’\noversight and budgeting processes. Current program challenges include, but are not limited to, supplier and partner performance (including COVID-19\nrelated challenges), software development, the availability and receipt of funding for contracts on a timely basis, execution of future flight tests and\nfindings resulting from testing and operating the aircraft, the level of cost associated with life-cycle operations and sustainment and warranties, continuing\nto reduce the unit production costs, and achieving cost targets.\nBudget uncertainty, the risk of future budget cuts, the potential for U.S. government shutdowns, the use of continuing resolutions, and the federal debt\nceiling can adversely affect our industry and the funding for our programs.

As funds are typically appropriated on a fiscal year basis, and because the costs of a termination for convenience may exceed the\ncosts of continuing a program in a given fiscal year, programs occasionally do not have sufficient funds appropriated to cover the termination costs if the\ngovernment were to terminate them for convenience. Under such circumstances, the U.S. Government could assert that it is not required to appropriate\nadditional funding.\nA termination arising out of our default may expose us to liability and have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and\norders. In addition, on those contracts for which we are teamed with others and are not the prime contractor, the U.S. Government could terminate a prime\ncontract under which we are a subcontractor, notwithstanding the fact that our performance and the quality of the products or services we delivered were\nconsistent with our contractual obligations as a subcontractor. In the case of termination for default, the U.S. Government could make claims to reduce the\ncontract value or recover its procurement costs and could assess other special penalties. Under such circumstances we may have rights and there may be\nremedial actions available to us under applicable laws and the FAR.\nAdditionally, our programs for the U.S. Government often operate for periods of time under Undefinitized Contract Actions (UCAs), which means that\nwe begin performing our obligations before the terms, specifications or price are finally agreed to between the parties. The U.S. Government has the ability\nto unilaterally definitize contracts, which, absent a successful appeal, obligates us to perform under terms and conditions imposed by the U.S. Government.\nThe U.S. Government has unilaterally definitized contracts with us in the past, most notably the F-35 LRIP 9 contract in 2016 and more recently two FMS\nF-16 upgrade proposals in 2020, and may do so in the future.

Our customers also may pursue non-traditional contract provisions or contract types in negotiation of contracts. The\nU.S. Government’s preference for fixed-price contracting has resulted in what we believe to be the inappropriate application of fixed-priced contracting\nmethods to development programs. By their nature, the technical challenges, costs and timing of development programs are difficult to estimate and the use\nof fixed-price instead of cost-reimbursable contracts for such programs increases the financial risk to the contractor. This increased risk may lead to losses\non fixed price development programs or may cause us not to bid on future fixed-price development programs, which could adversely affect our future\ngrowth prospects and financial performance. In addition, given the customer’s emphasis on cost, even if we effectively manage program life-cycle and\nsustainment costs and meet customer affordability targets, the customer may elect to recompete programs at the end of existing contracts, which may result\nin a lost business opportunity.

Cost overruns or the\nfailure to perform on existing programs also may adversely affect our ability to retain existing programs and win future contract awards.\nUnder fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform specified work for a pre-determined price. To the extent our actual costs vary from the estimates upon\nwhich the price was negotiated, we will generate more or less profit or could incur a loss.

Cost-plus-award-fee contracts provide for an award fee that varies within specified limits based on the customer’s assessment of our\nperformance against a predetermined set of criteria, such as targets based on cost, quality, technical and schedule criteria. Cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts\nprovide for reimbursement of costs plus a fee that is adjusted by a formula based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs (i.e.,\nincentive based on cost) or reimbursement of costs plus an incentive to exceed stated performance targets (i.e., incentive based on performance).

Nevertheless, due to the evolving nature of these security threats and the national security aspects of much of the\ndata we protect, the impact of any future incident cannot be predicted.\nIn addition to cyber threats, we experience threats to the security of our facilities and employees and threats from terrorist acts. We also typically work\ncooperatively with our customers, suppliers, subcontractors, joint venture partners and entities we acquire, whom are subject to similar threats, to seek to\nminimize the impact of cyber threats, other security threats or business disruptions.

The impact of these plans on our earnings may be volatile in that the amount of expense we record for our\npostretirement benefit plans may materially change from year to year because the calculations are sensitive to changes in several key economic\nassumptions including interest rates and rates of return on plan assets, other actuarial assumptions including participant longevity (also known as mortality)\nand employee turnover, as well as the timing of cash funding. Changes in these factors, including actual returns on plan assets, may also affect our plan\nfunding, cash flow and stockholders’ equity. In addition, the funding of our plans and recovery of costs on our contracts, as described below, may also be\nsubject to changes caused by legislative or regulatory actions.\nWith regard to cash flow, we make substantial cash contributions to our plans as required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974\n(ERISA), as amended by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA). We generally are able to recover these contributions related to our plans as allowable\ncosts on our U.S. Government contracts, including FMS. However, there is a lag between the time when we contribute cash to our plans under pension\nfunding rules and when we recover pension costs under U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS). We also may not be successful in our efforts\nto reduce the volatility of our outstanding pension obligations and to accelerate CAS recovery and recover associated costs from the U.S. Government.\nFor more information on how these factors could impact earnings, financial position, cash flow and stockholders’ equity, see “Critical Accounting\nPolicies - Postretirement Benefit Plans” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and “Note 12 –\nPostretirement Benefit Plans” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOur estimates and projections may prove to be inaccurate and certain of our assets may be at risk of future impairment.\nThe accounting for some of our most significant activities is based on judgments and estimates, which are complex and subject to many variables.

Many of these suppliers also supply parts for commercial aviation businesses which\nhave been more significantly impacted by the pandemic due to the impacts on these markets. Global supply chain disruption caused by the response to\nCOVID-19 has impacted some of our programs and could impact our ability to perform on our contracts, in particular in instances where there is not a\nqualified second source of supply. We have identified a number of suppliers that have experienced delivery impacts due to COVID-19 and have been\nworking to manage those impacts. However, if alternatives or other mitigations are not effective, deliveries and other milestones on affected programs\ncould be adversely impacted.\nOur work in production facilities and labs has continued throughout the pandemic, consistent with guidance from federal, state and local officials to\nminimize the spread of COVID-19. We have taken actions to equip employees with personal protective equipment, establish minimum staffing and social\ndistancing policies, sanitize workspaces more frequently, adopt alternate work schedules and institute other measures aimed to sustain production and\nrelated services while minimizing the transmission of COVID-19. In addition, we have implemented a flexible teleworking policy for employees who can\nmeet our customer commitments remotely, and a significant portion of our workforce is currently teleworking. It remains uncertain when and on what scale\nteleworking employees will return to work in person. We have not previously experienced such a signific",

The outlook for 2021 assumes continued support and funding of our programs, known impacts of COVID-19, and a statutory tax\nrate of 21%. Additionally, it assumes that there will not be significant reductions in customer budgets, changes in funding priorities and that the U.S.\nGovernment will not operate under a continuing resolution for an extended period in which new contract and program starts are restricted. Changes in\ncircumstances may require us to revise our assumptions, which could materially change our current estimate of 2021 net sales, operating margin and cash\nflows.\nWe expect a total net FAS/CAS pension benefit of approximately $2.3 billion in 2021 based on a 2.50% discount rate (a 75 basis point decrease from\nthe end of 2019), an approximate 16.5% return on plan assets in 2020, and a 7.00% expected long-term rate of return on plan assets in future years, among\nother assumptions. We expect to make contributions of approximately $1.0 billion to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2021 and anticipate\nrecovering approximately $2.1 billion of CAS pension cost.\nPortfolio Shaping Activities\nWe continuously strive to strengthen our portfolio of products and services to meet the current and future needs of our customers. We accomplish this\nin part by our independent research and development activities and through acquisition, divestiture and internal realignment activities.\nWe selectively pursue the acquisition of businesses and investments at attractive valuations that will expand or complement our current portfolio and\nallow access to new customers or technologies.

In pursuing our business strategy, we routinely conduct discussions, evaluate targets and enter into agreements\nregarding possible acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures and equity investments.\nAcquisitions\nOn December 20, 2020 we entered into an agreement to acquire Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, Inc. (Aerojet Rocketdyne) for $56 per share in cash,\nwhich is expected to be reduced to $51 per share after Aerojet Rocketdyne pays a pre-closing special dividend to its stockholders on March 24, 2021.

The appropriations provide $741 billion in discretionary funding for national defense (includes DoD funding\nand defense-related spending in energy and water development, homeland security, and military construction appropriations), of which $671 billion is in\nbase funding and $69 billion is Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO)/emergency funding (OCO and emergency supplemental funding do not count\ntoward discretionary spending caps). Of the $741 billion, the DoD was allocated $704 billion, composed of $635 billion in base funding and $69 billion in\nOCO and emergency funding. The appropriations adhere to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 (BBA 2019), which increased the spending limits for both\ndefense and non-defense discretionary funds for the final two years (FY 2020 and FY 2021) of the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA).\nThe Appropriations Act also provides stimulus funds to individuals, businesses, and hospitals in response to the economic distress caused by the\ncoronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Additionally, it extends Section 3610 of the CARES Act until March 31, 2021, which gives DoD and federal agencies\ndiscretion to reimburse contractors for any paid leave, including sick leave, a contractor provides during the pandemic to keep its employees in a ready\nstate.\nInternational",

To accomplish this growth, we continue to focus on strengthening our\nrelationships internationally through partnerships and joint technology efforts. We conduct business with international customers through each of our\nbusiness segments through either FMS or direct sales to international customers. See Item 1A - Risk Factors for a discussion of risks related to international\nsales.\nInternational customers accounted for 31% of Aeronautics’ 2020 net sales. There continues to be strong international interest in the F-35 program,\nwhich includes commitments from the U.S. Government and seven international partner countries and six international customers, as well as expressions of\ninterest from other countries. The U.S. Government and the partner countries continue to work together on the design, testing, production, and sustainment\nof the F-35 program. Other areas of international expansion at our Aeronautics business segment include the F-16 and C-130J programs. Aeronautics\nreceived contracts in 2020 with Bulgaria and Taiwan for new F-16 aircraft, extending work beyond 2025. The C-130J Super Hercules aircraft continued to\ndraw interest from various international customers, including a contract in 2020 from New Zealand.\nIn 2020, international customers accounted for 25% of MFC’s net sales. Our MFC business segment continues to generate significant international\ninterest, most notably in the air and missile defense product line, which produces the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) and Terminal High Altitude\nArea Defense (THAAD) systems. The PAC-3 family of missiles are the only combat proven Hit-to-Kill interceptors that defend against incoming threats,\nincluding tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and aircraft. Fourteen nations have chosen PAC-3 Cost Reduction Initiative (CRI) and PAC-3 Missile\nSegment Enhancement (MSE) to provide missile defense capabilities. THAAD is an integrated system designed to protect against high altitude ballistic\nmissile threats. Additionally, we continue to see international demand for our tactical missile and fire control products, where we received orders for\nprecision fires systems from Poland and Romania; and Apache and Low Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infrared for Night (LANTIRN ) systems for\nQatar.\nIn 2020, international customers accounted for 25% of RMS’ net sales.

Production of the aircraft is\nexpected to continue for many years given the U.S. Government’s current inventory objective of 2,456 aircraft for the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Marine Corps,\nand U.S. Navy; commitments from our seven international partner countries and six international customers; as well as expressions of interest from other\ncountries.\nDuring 2020, the F-35 program completed several milestones both domestically and internationally. The U.S. Government continued testing the\naircraft, including ship trials, mission and weapons systems evaluations, and the F-35 fleet recently surpassed 355,000 flight hours. During the second half\nof 2020, the U.S. Government awarded the production of 18 F-35 Block Buy aircraft in addition to the 448 aircraft previously awarded.

See the discussion\nin Business Overview - COVID-19 and Item 1A, Risk Factors.\nAs a result of Turkey accepting delivery of the Russian S-400 air and missile defense system, the U.S. Government removed Turkey from the F-35\nprogram in 2019 and in December 2020 imposed sanctions on Turkey’s defense procurement agency (SSB) and certain of the agency’s officers under the\nCountering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA). The primary sanction imposed was a restriction on all new U.S. export licenses and\nauthorizations for any goods or technology transferred to the SSB, but does not apply to current, valid export licenses and authorizations. Lockheed Martin\nexpects the U.S. Government to continue to engage Turkey on these issues, but we have no indication that the sanctions will be removed, that additional\nsanctions will not be imposed or that Turkey will not issue reciprocal sanctions. While we do not expect the current sanctions to have a material effect on\nour current programs, additional sanctions, reciprocal sanctions or other actions, could be material to our operations, operating results, financial position or\ncash flows.\nIn addition to having committed to purchase up to 100 F-35 aircraft, six of which had completed production at the time of removal, Turkish suppliers\ncontinue to produce component parts for the F-35 program, some of which are single-sourced. To minimize the risks of disruption of our supply chain and\nensure continuity of F-35 production, we have been working closely with the DoD and supporting activities to identify and engage alternate suppliers for\nthe component parts produced by Turkish suppliers. We have made significant progress transitioning to non-Turkish suppliers, but due to the procedure to\nqualify new parts and suppliers, this collaborative process between DoD and Lockheed Martin is ongoing. During 2020, the DoD publicly confirmed that\nTurkish suppliers would be permitted to provide certain components for the F-35 through 2022. While the transition timeline is an important first step, it is\nequally important that our replacement capacity is re-established so that production is not impacted. Efforts to date have significantly reduced our risk, but\nfinal resolution on a limited number of remaining components could affect F-35 deliveries, and any accelerated work stoppage would impact cost. We will\ncontinue to follow official U.S. Government guidance as it relates to completed Turkish aircraft and the export and import of component parts from the\nTurkish supply chain.\nThe effects on the F-35 program of the U.S. Government sanctions on the SSB and Turkey’s removal from the F-35 program do not appear to be\nsignificant at this time.

This approach is consistent throughout the life cycle of our contracts, as management assesses the bidding of each contract by focusing on net\nsales and operating profit and monitors performance on our contracts in a similar manner through their completion.\nWe regularly provide customers with reports of our costs as the contract progresses. The cost information in the reports is accumulated in a manner\nspecified by the requirements of each contract. For example, cost data provided to a customer for a product would typically align to the subcomponents of\nthat product (such as a wing-box on an aircraft) and for services would align to the type of work being performed (such as aircraft sustainment). Our\ncontracts generally allow for the recovery of costs in the pricing of our products and services. Most of our contracts are bid and negotiated with our\ncustomers under circumstances in which we are required to disclose our estimated total costs to provide the product or service. This approach for\nnegotiating contracts with our U.S. Government customers generally allows for recovery of our actual costs plus a reasonable profit margin. We also may\nenter into long-term supply contracts for certain materials or components to coincide with the production schedule of certain products and to ensure their\navailability at known unit prices.\nMany of our contracts span several years and include highly complex technical requirements. At the outset of a contract, we identify and monitor risks\nto the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract and assess the effects of those risks on our estimates of total costs to complete\nthe contract. The estimates consider the technical requirements (e.g., a newly-developed product versus a mature product), the schedule and associated\ntasks (e.g., the number and type of milestone events) and costs (e.g., material, labor, subcontractor, overhead and the estimated costs to fulfill our industrial\ncooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, required under certain contracts with international customers). The initial profit\nbooking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements, schedule and costs in the initial estimated total\ncosts to complete the contract. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the\ntechnical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract, which decreases the estimated total costs to complete the contract. Conversely, our profit booking rates\nmay decrease if the estimated total costs to complete the contract increase. All of the estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract\nand may affect the profit booking rate.\nWe have a number of programs that are designated as classified by the U.S. Government which cannot be specifically described.

Changes in volume refer to increases or decreases in sales or\noperating profit resulting from varying production activity levels, deliveries or service levels on individual contracts. Volume changes in segment operating\nprofit are typically based on the current profit booking rate for a particular contract.\nIn addition, comparability of our segment sales, operating profit and operating margin may be impacted favorably or unfavorably by changes in profit\nbooking rates on our contracts for which we recognize revenue over time using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method to measure progress\ntowards completion. Increases in the profit booking rates, typically referred to as risk retirements, usually relate to revisions in the estimated total costs to\nfulfill the performance obligations that reflect improved conditions on a particular contract. Conversely, conditions on a particular contract may deteriorate,\nresulting in an increase in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations and a reduction in the profit booking rate. Increases or decreases in\nprofit booking rates are recognized in the current period and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. Segment operating profit and margin may\nalso be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other items, which may or may not impact sales. Favorable items may include the positive resolution of\ncontractual matters, cost recoveries on severance and restructuring charges, insurance recoveries and gains on sales of assets. Unfavorable items may\ninclude the adverse resolution of contractual matters; restructuring charges, except for significant severance actions, which are excluded from segment\noperating results; reserves for disputes; certain asset impairments; and losses on sales of certain assets.\nAs previously disclosed, we are responsible for a prog",

Typically, we enter into three types of cost-reimbursable contracts: cost-plus-award-fee, cost-plus-incentive-fee, and cost-\nplus-fixed-fee. Cost-plus-award-fee contracts provide for an award fee that varies within specified limits based on the customer’s assessment of our\nperformance against a predetermined set of criteria, such as targets based on cost, quality, technical and schedule criteria. Cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts\nprovide for reimbursement of costs plus a fee, which is adjusted by a formula based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs (i.e.,\nincentive based on cost) or reimbursement of costs plus an incentive to exceed stated performance targets (i.e., incentive based on performance). The fixed-\nfee in a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract is negotiated at the inception of the contract and that fixed-fee does not vary with actual costs.\nWe assess each contract at its inception to determine whether it should be combined with other contracts. When making this determination, we\nconsider factors such as whether two or more contracts were negotiated and executed at or near the same\n(a)\n(a)\n54\n\n\nTable of Contents\ntime or were negotiated with an overall profit objective. If combined, we treat the combined contracts as a single contract for revenue recognition purposes.\nWe evaluate the products or services promised in each contract at inception to determine whether the contract should be accounted for as having one\nor more performance obligations.

Accordingly, our contracts are typically accounted for as one\nperformance obligation. In limited cases, our contracts have more than one distinct performance obligation, which occurs when we perform activities that\nare not highly complex or interrelated or involve different product lifecycles.

Contracts are often subsequently modified to include changes in\nspecifications, requirements or price, which may create new or change existing enforceable rights and obligations. Depending on the nature of the\nmodification, we consider whether to account for the modification as an adjustment to the existing contract or as a separate contract. Generally,\nmodifications to our contracts are not distinct from the existing contract due to the significant integration and interrelated tasks provided in the context of\nthe contract. Therefore, such modifications are accounted for as if they were part of the existing contract and recognized as a cumulative adjustment to\nrevenue.\nFor contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on the estimated\nstandalone selling price of the product or service underlying each performance obligation. The standalone selling price represents the amount we would sell\nthe product or service to a customer on a standalone basis (i.e., not bundled with any other products or services). Our contracts with the U.S. Government,\nincluding FMS contracts, are subject to FAR and the price is typically based on estimated or actual costs plus a reasonable profit margin.

We primarily sell customized solutions unique to a customer’s specifications. When it is necessary to allocate the\ntransaction price to multiple performance obligations, we typically use the expected cost plus a reasonable profit margin to estimate the standalone selling\nprice of each product or service.

For most non-U.S. Government contracts, primarily\ninternational direct commercial contracts, continuous transfer of control to our customer is supported because we deliver products that do not have an\nalternative use to us and if our customer were to terminate the contract for reasons other than our non-performance we would have the right to recover\ndamages which would include, among other potential damages, the right to payment for our work performed to date plus a reasonable profit.\nFor performance obligations to deliver products with continuous transfer of control to the customer, revenue is recognized based on the extent of\nprogress towards completion of the performance obligation, generally using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress for our\ncontracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer as we incur costs on our contracts.

Conversely, conditions on a particular contract may deteriorate, resulting\nin an increase in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations and a reduction in the profit booking rate. Increases or decreases in profit\nbooking rates are recognized in the current period and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. Segment operating profit and margin may also be\nimpacted favorably or unfavorably by other items, which may or may not impact sales. Favorable items may include the positive resolution of contractual\nmatters, cost recoveries on severance and restructuring charges, insurance recoveries and gains on sales of assets. Unfavorable items may include the\nadverse resolution of contractual matters; restructuring charges, except for significant severance actions, which are excluded from segment operating\nresults; reserves for disputes; certain asset impairments; and losses on sales of certain assets.\nOther Contract Accounting Considerations\nThe majority of our sales are driven by pricing based on c",

During December 2020, Lockheed Martin, through its master\nretirement trust, purchased an irrevocable group annuity contract from an insurance company (referred to as a buy-out contract) for $1.4 billion to transfer\nthe related, outstanding defined benefit pension obligations. As a result of this transaction, we were relieved of all responsibility for these pension\nobligations and the insurance company is now required to pay and administer the retirement benefits owed to approximately 13,500 U.S. retirees and\nbeneficiaries, with no change to the amount, timing or form of monthly retirement benefit payments. Although the transaction was treated as a settlement\nfor accounting purposes, we did not recognize a loss on the settlement in earnings associated with the transaction because total settlements during 2020 for\nthe affected pension plans were less than the plans’ service and interest cost in 2020.\nA second contract was also purchased from an insurance company for $793 million that will reimburse the plan for all future benefit payments related\nto approximately 2,500 U.S. retirees and beneficiaries (referred to as a buy-in contract). The covered retirees and beneficiaries and buy-in contract were\nspun-off to the plan established in December 2018 for the contract purchased at that time similarly structured as a buy-in; the buy-in contracts are the sole\nassets of that plan. Under the arrangement, the plan remains responsible for paying the benefits for the covered retirees and beneficiaries and the insurance\ncompany will reimburse the plan as those benefits are paid. As a result, there is no net ongoing cash flow to the plan for the covered retirees and\nbeneficiaries as the cost of providing the benefits is funded by the buy-in contract; effectively locking in the cost of the benefits and eliminating future\nvolatility of the benefit obligation, while also providing the option to convert to a buy-out. The buy-in contract was purchased using assets from the pension\ntrust and is accounted for at fair value as an investment of the trust. These transactions had no impact on our 2020 FAS pension expense or CAS pension\ncost.\nSince December 2018, Lockheed Martin, through its master retirement trust, has purchased total contracts (both buy-in and buy-out) for approximately\n$6.7 billion related to our outstanding defined benefit pension obligations eliminating pension plan volatility for approximately 77,000 retirees and\nbeneficiaries and annually required Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation (PBGC) premiums of approximately $55 milli",

The amounts we record are measured using actuarial valuations, which are dependent upon key\nassumptions such as discount rates, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, participant longevity, employee turnover and the health care cost\ntrend rates for our retiree medical plans. The assumptions we make affect both the calculation of the benefit obligations as of the measurement date and the\ncalculation of net periodic benefit cost in subsequent periods. When reassessing these assumptions, we consider past and current market conditions and\nmake judgments about future market trends. We also consider factors such as the timing and amounts of expected contributions to the plans and benefit\npayments to plan participants.\nWe continue to use a single weighted average discount rate approach when calculating our consolidated benefit obligations related to our defined\nbenefit pension plans resulting in 2.50% at December 31, 2020, compared to 3.25% at December 31, 2019. We utilized a single weighted average discount\nrate of 2.375% when calculating our benefit obligations related to our retiree medical and life insurance plans at December 31, 2020, compared to 3.25% at\nDecember 31, 2019. We evaluate several data points in order to arrive at an appropriate single weighted average discount rate, including results from cash\nflow models, quoted rates from long-term bond indices and changes in long-term bond rates over the past year. As part of our evaluation, we calculate the\napproximate average yields on corporate bonds rated AA or better selected to match our projected postretirement benefit plan cash flows. The decrease in\nthe discount rate from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020 resulted in an increase in the projected benefit obligations of our qualified defined benefit\npension plans of approximately $4.9 billion at December 31, 2020.\nWe utilized an expected l",

The long-term rate of\nreturn assumption represents the expected long-term rate of return on the funds invested or to be invested, to provide for the benefits included in the benefit\nobligations. This assumption is based on several factors including historical market index returns, the anticipated long-term allocation of plan assets, the\nhistorical return data for the trust funds, plan expenses and the potential to outperform market index returns. The difference between the long-term rate of\nreturn on plan assets assumption we select and the actual return on plan assets in any given year affects both the funded status of our benefit plans and the\ncalculation of FAS pension expense in subsequent periods. Although the actual return in any specific year likely will differ from the assumption, the\naverage expected return over a long-term future horizon should be approximately equal to the assumption. Any variance each year should not, by itself,\nsuggest that the assumption should be changed. Patterns of variances are reviewed over time, and then combined with expectations for the future. As a\nresult, changes in this assumption are less frequent than changes in the discount rate. The actual investment return for our qualified defined benefit plans\nduring 2020 of $5.6 billion based on an actual rate of approximately 16.5% improved plan assets more than the $2.3 billion expected return based on our\n7.00% long-term rate of return assumption.\nIn October 2020, the Society of Actuaries published revised longevity assumptions that refined its prior studies.

For selected reporting units where we use the\nqualitative approach, we perform a qualitative evaluation of events and circumstances impacting the reporting unit to determine the likelihood of goodwill\nimpairment. Based on that qualitative evaluation, if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying\namount, no further evaluation is necessary.

The cash flows employed in the DCF analysis are based on our best estimate of future sales, earnings and cash flows after\nconsidering factors such as general market conditions, U.S. Government budgets, existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers,\nlabor agreements, changes in working capital, long term business plans and recent operating performance. The discount rates utilized in the DCF analysis\nare based on the respective reporting unit’s weighted average cost of capital, which takes into account the relative weights of each component of capital\nstructure (equity and debt) and represents the expected cost of new capital, adjusted as appropriate to consider the risk inherent in future cash flows of the\nrespective reporting unit. The carrying value of each reporting unit includes the assets and liabilities employed in its operations, goodwill and allocations of\namounts held at the business segment and corporate levels.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, we performed our annual goodwill impai",

As of the date of our annual impairment test, the fair value of our Sikorsky reporting unit exceeded\nits carrying value, which included goodwill of $2.7 billion, by a margin of approximately 30%. The fair value of our Sikorsky reporting unit can be\nsignificantly impacted by changes in expected future orders, general market pressures, including U.S. Government budgetary constraints, discount rates,\nlong term growth rates, and changes in U.S. (federal or state) or foreign tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, including those\nwith retroactive effect, along with other significant judgments. Based on our assessment of these circumstances, we have determined that goodwill at our\nSikorsky reporting unit is at risk for impairment should there be a deterioration of projected cash flows of the reporting unit.\n61\n\n\nTable of Contents\nImpairment assessments inherently involve management judgments regarding a number of assumptions such as those described above. Due to the\nmany variables inherent in the estimation of a reporting unit’s fair value and the relative size of our recorded goodwill, differences in assumptions could\nhave a material effect on the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period.\nAcquired intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to annual impairment testing. This testing compares\ncarrying value to fair value and, when appropriate, the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we performed\nour annual impairment test, and the results of that test indicated no impairment existed. Finite-lived intangibles are amortized to expense over the\napplicable useful lives, ranging from three to 20 years, based on the nature of the asset and the underlying pattern of economic benefit as reflected by future\nnet cash inflows. We perform an impairment test of finite-lived intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value may\nbe impaired. If events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of a finite-lived intangible may be impaired, the sum of the undiscounted\nfuture cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset group would be compared to the asset group’s carrying value. If the asset group’s carrying\namount exceed the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows, we would determine the fair value of the asset group and record an impairment loss in net\nearnings.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee “Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (under the caption “Recent Accounting\nPronouncements”).\n62\n\n\nTable of Contents\nITEM  7A.

We believe that they provide us with\nsufficient access to the general and trade credit we require to conduct our business. We continue to closely monitor the financial market environment and\nactively manage counterparty exposure to minimize the potential impact from adverse developments with any single credit provider while ensuring\navailability of, and access to, sufficient credit resources.\nOur main exposure to market risk relates to interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and market prices on certain equity securities. Our financial\ninstruments that are subject to interest rate risk principally include fixed-rate long-term debt and commercial paper, if issued. The estimated fair value of\nour outstanding debt was $16.9 billion at December 31, 2020 and the outstanding principal amount was $13.3 billion, excluding unamortized discounts and\nissuance costs of $1.1 billion. A 10% change in the level of interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of our outstanding debt at\nDecember 31, 2020.\nWe use derivative instruments principally to reduce our exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.\nWe do not enter into or hold derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes. We transact business globally and are subject to risks associated with\nchanging foreign currency exchange rates. We enter into foreign currency hedges such as forward and option contracts that change in value as foreign\ncurrency exchange rates change. Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the British pound sterling, the euro, the Canadian dollar and the\nAustralian dollar. These contracts hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions in order to mitigate fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows associated\nwith changes in foreign currency exchange rates. As a result, we do not have material foreign currency transaction exposure, including exposure to the\npound sterling or euro should there be material foreign currency fluctuations due to the United Kingdom departing from the European Union (commonly\nreferred to as Brexit). We designate foreign currency hedges as cash flow hedges. We also are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes primarily\nthrough our borrowing activities. For fixed rate borrowings, we may use variable interest rate swaps, effectively converting fixed rate borrowings to\nvariable rate borrowings in order to hedge changes in the fair value of the debt. These swaps are designated as fair value hedges. For variable rate\nborrowings, we may use fixed interest rate swaps, effectively converting variable rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings in order to mitigate the impact of\ninterest rate changes on earnings.

Adjustments to reflect changes in fair values of derivatives attributable to highly effective hedges are either reflected in earnings and\nlargely offset by corresponding adjustments to the hedged items or reflected net of income taxes in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged\ntransaction is recognized in earnings. Changes in the fair value of the derivatives that are not highly effective, if any, are immediately recognized in\nearnings. The aggregate notional amount of our outstanding interest rate swaps at December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $572 million and $750 million. The\naggregate notional amount of our outstanding foreign currency hedges at December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $3.4 billion and $3.8 billion. At December 31,\n2020 and 2019, the net fair value of our derivative instruments was not material (see “Note 17 – Fair Value Measurements” included in our Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements). A 10% unfavorable exchange rate movement of our foreign currency contracts would not have a material impact on\nthe aggregate net fair value of such contracts or our consolidated financial statements.

As more fully described in Note 1 to\nthe consolidated financial statements, the Corporation generates the majority of its net sales from long-term contracts with its\ncustomers whereby substantially all of the Corporation’s revenue is recognized over time using the percentage-of-completion\ncost-to-cost measure of progress. Under the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress, the Corporation\nmeasures progress towards completion based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the estimated total costs to complete the\nperformance obligation(s) (referred to as the estimate-at-completion analysis). The Corporation estimates profit on these\ncontracts as the difference between total estimated revenues and total estimated cost at completion.\nThe percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions to\nestimate contract sales and costs associated with its contracts with customers. At the outset of a long-term contract, the\nCorporation identifies risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract. Throughout the\ncontract life cycle, the Corporation monitors and assesses the effects of those risks on its estimates of sales and total costs to\ncomplete the contract. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if the Corporation successfully\nretires risks surrounding the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract, which would decrease the estimated total costs\nto complete the contract. Conversely, the profit booking rates may decrease if the estimated total costs to complete the contract\nincrease. Changes to the profit booking rates resulting from changes in estimates could have a material effect on the\nCorporation’s results of operations.\nAuditing the Corporation’s estimate-at-completion analyses used in its revenue recognition process was complex ",

For example, we tested internal controls over management’s review of the estimate-\nat-completion analyses and the significant assumptions underlying the estimated contract value and estimated total costs to\ncomplete. We also tested internal controls that management executes to validate the data used in the estimate-at-completion\nanalyses was complete and accurate.\nTo test the accuracy of the Corporation’s estimate-at-completion analyses, our audit procedures included, among others,\ncomparing estimates of labor costs, subcontractor costs, and materials to historical results of similar contracts, and agreeing the\nkey terms to contract documentation and management’s estimates. We also performed sensitivity analyses over the significant\nassumptions to evaluate the change in the profit booking rates resulting from changes in the assumptions.\nGoodwill Impairment Assessment – Sikorsky Reporting Unit\nDescription of the\nMatter\nAt December 31, 2020, the Corporation’s Sikorsky reporting unit had a goodwill balance of $2.7 billion which represented\napproximately 5.2% of total assets. As discussed in Note 1 and Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, goodwill is tested\nfor impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level using either a qualitative or quantitative approach. Under the\nquantitative approach to test for goodwill impairment, the Corporation compares the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying\namount, including goodwill. Generally, the Corporation estimates the fair value of its reporting units using a combination of a\ndiscounted cash flows analysis and market-based valuation methodologies.\nAuditing management’s annual impairment test over the Sikorsky reporting unit goodwill was complex and highly judgmental\ndue to the significant estimation required in determining the fair value. In particular, the fair value estimate was sensitive to\nsignificant assumptions, such as revenue growth rates, operating margins, cash flows, terminal value, and weighted average cost\nof capital, which are affected by expectations about future market or economic conditions and expected future operating results\nof the Sikorsky business.\n65\n\n\nTable of Contents\nHow We Addressed\nthe Matter in Our\nAudit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of relevant internal controls over the\nCorporation’s goodwill impai",

As explained in Note 12 of the consolidated financial statements, the Corporation remeasures\nthe qualified defined benefit pension assets and obligations at the end of each year or more frequently upon the occurrence of\ncertain events. The amounts are measured using actuarial valuations, which depend on key assumptions such as the discount rate,\nthe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, and participant longevity.\nAuditing the defined benefit pension obligation was complex and required the involvement of specialists as a result of the\njudgmental nature of the actuarial assumptions such as discount rate, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, and\nparticipant longevity, used in the measurement process.

We also provide a broad range of management, engineering, technical, scientific,\nlogistics, system integration and cybersecurity services. We serve both U.S. and international customers with products and services that have defense, civil\nand commercial applications, with our principal customers being agencies of the U.S. Government.\nBasis of presentation – Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of subsidiaries we control and variable interest entities if we are\nthe primary beneficiary. We eliminate intercompany balances and transactions in consolidation. Our receivables, inventories, customer advances and\namounts in excess of costs incurred and certain amounts in other current liabilities primarily are attributable to long-term contracts or programs in progress\nfor which the related operating cycles are longer than one year. In accordance with industry practice, we include these items in current assets and current\nliabilities. Unless otherwise noted, we present all per share amounts cited in these consolidated financial statements on a “per diluted share” basis.\nUse of estimates – We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In\ndoing so, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying\nnotes. We base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the\nresults of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.\nOur actual results may differ materially from these estimates. Significant estimates inherent in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements\ninclude, but are not limited to, accounting for sales and cost recognition, postretirement benefit plans, assets for the portion of environmental costs that are\nprobable of future recovery and liabilities, evaluation of goodwill and other assets for impairment, income taxes including deferred income taxes, fair value\nmeasurements and contingencies.\nRevenue Recognition – The majority of our net sales are generated from long-term contracts with the U.S. Government and international customers\n(including foreign military sales (FMS) contracted through the U.S. Government) for the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and\nsustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services.

For\ncertain contracts that meet the foregoing requirements, primarily international direct commercial sale contracts, we are required to obtain certain regulatory\napprovals. In these cases, we recognize revenue when it is probable that we will receive regulatory approvals based upon all known facts and\ncircumstances. We provide our products and services under fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts.\nUnder fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform the specified work for a pre-determined price. To the extent our actual costs vary from the estimates\nupon which the price was negotiated, we will generate more or less profit or could incur a loss. Some fixed-price contracts have a performance-based\ncomponent under which we may earn incentive payments or incur financial penalties based on our performance.\nCost-reimbursable contracts provide for the payment of allowable costs incurred during performance of the contract plus a fee up to a ceiling based on\nthe amount that has been funded. Typically, we enter into three types of cost-reimbursable contracts: cost-plus-award-fee, cost-plus-incentive-fee, and cost-\nplus-fixed-fee. Cost-plus-award-fee contracts provide for an award fee that varies within specified limits based on the customer’s assessment of our\nperformance against a predetermined set of criteria, such as targets based on cost, quality, technical and schedule criteria. Cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts\nprovide for reimbursement of costs plus a fee, which is adjusted by a formula based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs (i.e.,\nincentive based on cost) or reimbursement of costs plus an incentive to exceed stated performance targets (i.e., incentive based on performance). The fixed-\nfee in a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract is negotiated at the inception of the contract and that fixed-fee does not vary with actual costs.\nWe assess each contract at its inception to determine whether it should be combined with other contracts. When making this determination, we\nconsider factors such as whether two or more contracts were negotiated and executed at or near the same time or were negotiated with an overall profit\nobjective. If combined, we treat the combined contracts as a single contract for revenue recognition purposes.\n72\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWe evaluate the products or services promised in each contract at inception to determine whether the contract should be accounted for as having one\nor more performance obligations. The products and services in our contracts are typically not distinct from one another due to their complex relationships\nand the significant contract management functions required to perform under the contract.

In limited cases, our contracts have more than one distinct performance obligation, which occurs when we perform activities that\nare not highly complex or interrelated or involve different product lifecycles. Significant judgment is required in determining performance obligations, and\nthese decisions could change the amount of revenue and profit recorded in a given period. We classify net sales as products or services on our consolidated\nstatements of earnings based on the predominant attributes of the performance obligations.\nWe determine the transaction price for each contract based on the consideration we expect to receive for the products or services being provided under\nthe contract. For contracts where a portion of the price may vary, we estimate variable consideration at the most likely amount, which is included in the\ntransaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. We analyze the risk of a significant\nrevenue reversal and if necessary constrain the amount of variable consideration recognized in order to mitigate this risk.\nAt the inception of a contract we estimate the transaction price based on our current rights and do not contemplate future modifications (including\nunexercised options) or follow-on contracts until they become legally enforceable. Contracts are often subsequently modified to include changes in\nspecifications, requirements or price, which may create new or change existing enforceable rights and obligations. Depending on the nature of the\nmodification, we consider whether to account for the modification as an adjustment to the existing contract or as a separate contract. Generally,\nmodifications to our contracts are not distinct from the existing contract due to the significant integration and interrelated tasks provided in the context of\nthe contract. Therefore, such modifications are accounted for as if they were part of the existing contract and recognized as a cumulative adjustment to\nrevenue.\nFor contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on the estimated\nstandalone selling price of the product or service underlying each performance obligation. The standalone selling price represents the amount we would sell\nthe product or service to a customer on a standalone basis (i.e., not bundled with any other products or services). Our contracts with the U.S. Government,\nincluding FMS contracts, are subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) and the price is typically based on estimated or actual costs plus a\nreasonable profit margin. As a result of these regulations, the standalone selling price of products or services in our contracts with the U.S. Government and\nFMS contracts are typically equal to the selling price stated in the contract.\nFor non-U.S. Government contracts with multiple performance obligations, we evaluate whet",

We primarily sell customized solutions unique to a customer’s specifications. When it is necessary to allocate the\ntransaction price to multiple performance obligations, we typically use the expected cost plus a reasonable profit margin to estimate the standalone selling\nprice of each product or service. We occasionally sell standard products or services with observable standalone sales transactions. In these situations, the\nobservable standalone sales transactions are used to determine the standalone selling price.\nWe recognize revenue as performance obligations are satisfied and the customer obtains control of the products and services. In determining when\nperformance obligations are satisfied, we consider factors such as contract terms, payment terms and whether there is an alternative future use of the\nproduct or service. Substantially all of our revenue is recognized over time as we perform under the contract because control of the work in process\ntransfers continuously to the customer. For most contracts with the U.S. Government and FMS contracts, this continuous transfer of control of the work in\nprocess to the customer is supported by clauses in the contract that give the customer ownership of work in process and allow the customer to unilaterally\nterminate the contract for convenience and pay us for costs incurred plus a reasonable profit. For most non-U.S. Government contracts, primarily\ninternational direct commercial contracts, continuous transfer of control to our customer is supported because we deliver products that do not have an\nalternative use to us and if our customer were to terminate the contract for reasons other than our non-performance we would have the right to recover\ndamages which would include, among other potential damages, the right to payment for our work performed to date plus a reasonable profit.\nFor performance obligations to deliver products with continuous transfer of control to the customer, revenue is recognized based on the extent of\nprogress towards completion of the performance obligation, generally using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress for our\ncontracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer as we incur costs on our contracts. Under the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost\nmeasure of progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs to\ncomplete the performance obligation(s). For performance obligations to provide services to the customer, revenue is recognized over time based on costs\nincurred or the right to invoice method (in situations where the value transferred matches our billing rights) as our customer receives and consumes the\nbenefits.\n73\n\n\nTable of Contents\nFor performance obligations in which control does not continuously transfer to",

This coincides with the point in time the customer obtains control of the product or service, which typically occurs\nupon customer acceptance or receipt of the product or service, given that we maintain control of the product or service until that point.\nBacklog (i.e., unfulfilled or remaining performance obligations) represents the sales we expect to recognize for our products and services for which\ncontrol has not yet transferred to the customer. It is converted into sales in future periods as work is performed or deliveries are made. For our cost-\nreimbursable and fixed-priced-incentive contracts, the estimated consideration we expect to receive pursuant to the terms of the contract may exceed the\ncontractual award amount. The estimated consideration is determined at the outset of the contract and is continuously reviewed throughout the contract\nperiod. In determining the estimated consideration, we consider the risks related to the technical, schedule and cost impacts to complete the contract and an\nestimate of any variable consideration. Periodically, we review these risks and may increase or decrease backlog accordingly. As the risks on such contracts\nare successfully retired, the estimated consideration from customers may be reduced, resulting in a reduction of backlog without a corresponding\nrecognition of sales. As of December 31, 2020, our ending backlog was $147.1 billion. We expect to recognize approximately 39% of our backlog over the\nnext 12 months and approximately 61% over the next 24 months as revenue, with the remainder recognized thereafter.\nFor arrangements with the U.S. Government and FMS contracts, we generally do not begin work on contracts until funding is appropriated by the\ncustomer. Billing timetables and payment terms on our contracts vary based on a number of factors, including the contract type. Typical payment terms\nunder fixed-price contracts with the U.S. Government provide that the customer pays either performance-based payments (PBPs) based on the achievement\nof contract milestones or progress payments based on a percentage of costs we incur. For the majority of our international direct commercial contracts to\ndeliver complex systems, we typically receive advance payments prior to commencement of work, as well as milestone payments that are paid in\naccordance with the terms of our contract as we perform. We recognize a liability for payments in excess of revenue recognized, which is presented as a\ncontract liability on the balance sheet.

Amounts\nbilled and due from our customers under both contract types are classified as receivables on the balance sheet.\nSignificant estimates and assumptions are made in estimating contract sales and costs, including the profit booking rate. At the outset of a long-term\ncontract, we identify and monitor risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract, as well as variable consideration, and\nassess the effects of those risks on our estimates of sales and total costs to complete the contract. The estimates consider the technical requirements (e.g., a\nnewly-developed product versus a mature product), the schedule and associated tasks (e.g., the number and type of milestone events) and costs (e.g.,\nmaterial, labor, subcontractor, overhead, general and administrative and the estimated costs to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes\nreferred to as offset or localization agreements, required under certain contracts with international customers). The initial profit booking rate of each\ncontract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements, schedule and costs in the initial estimated total costs to complete the\ncontract. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the technical, schedule and\ncost aspects of the contract, which decreases the estimated total costs to complete the contract or may increase the variable consideration we expect to\nreceive on the contract. Conversely, our profit booking rates may decrease if the estimated total costs to complete the contract increase or our estimates of\nvariable consideration we expect to receive decrease. All of the estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect the\nprofit booking rate. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of the transaction price, a provision for the entire loss\nis determined at the contract level and is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined.\nComparability of our segment sales, operating profit and operating margin may be impacted favorably or unfavorably by changes in profit booking\nrates on our contracts for which we recognize revenue over time using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method to measure progress towards\ncompletion.

The amounts may not exceed their\nestimated net realizable value. Contract assets are classified as current based on our contract operating cycle.\nInventories – We record inventories at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value. If events or changes in circumstances indicate that the utility\nof our inventories have diminished through damage, deterioration, obsolescence, changes in price or other causes, a loss is recognized in the period in\nwhich it occurs. We capitalize labor, material, subcontractor and overhead costs as work-in-process for contracts where control has not yet passed to the\ncustomer. In addition, we capitalize costs incurred to fulfill a contract in advance of contract award in inventories as work-in-process if we determine that\ncontract award is probable. We determine the costs of other product and supply inventories by using the first-in first-out or average cost methods.\nContract liabilities – Contract liabilities include advance payments and billings in excess of revenue recognized. Contract liabilities are classified as\ncurrent based on our contract operating cycle and reported on a contract-by-contract basis, net of revenue recognized, at the end of each reporting period.\nProperty, plant and equipment – We record property, plant and equipment at cost. We provide for depreciation and amortization on plant and\nequipment generally using accelerated methods during the first half of the estimated useful lives of the assets and the straight-line method thereafter. The\nestimated useful lives of our plant and equipment generally range from 10 to 40 years for buildings and five to 15 years for machinery and equipment.

Goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of\nacquired businesses. Intangible assets from acquired businesses are recognized at fair value on the acquisition date and consist of customer programs,\ntrademarks, customer relationships, technology and other intangible assets.

For selected reporting units where we\nuse the qualitative approach, we perform a qualitative evaluation of events and circumstances impacting the reporting unit to determine the likelihood of\ngoodwill impairment. Based on that qualitative evaluation, if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its\ncarrying amount, no further evaluation is necessary. Otherwise we perform a quantitative impairment test. We perform quantitative tests for most reporting\nunits at least once every three years. However, for certain reporting units we may perform a quantitative impairment test every year.\nFor the quantitative impairment test we compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of a\nreporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. If the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill,\nexceeds its fair value, a goodwill impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. We generally estimate the fair value of each reporting\nunit using a combination of a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis and market-based valuation methodologies such as comparable public company trading\nvalues and values observed in recent business acquisitions. Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgments, including the amount and\ntiming of expected future cash flows, long-term growth rates, discount rates and relevant comparable public company earnings multiples and relevant\ntransaction multiples. The cash flows employed in the DCF analysis are based on our best estimate of future sales, earnings and cash flows after\nconsidering factors such as general market conditions, U.S. Government budgets, existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers,\nlabor agreements, changes in working capital, long term business plans and recent operating performance. The discount rates utilized in the DCF analysis\nare based on the respective reporting unit’s weighted average cost of capital, which takes into account the relative weights of each component of capital\nstructure (equity and debt) and represents the expected cost of new capital, adjusted as appropriate to consider the risk inherent in future cash flows of the\nrespective reporting unit.

GAAP requires that the amounts we record related to our postretirement\nbenefit plans be computed, based on service to date, using actuarial valuations that are based in part on certain key economic assumptions we make,\nincluding the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and other actuarial assumptions including participant longevity (also known\nas mortality), health care cost trend rates and employee turnover, each as appropriate based on the nature of the plans.\nA market-related value of our plan assets, determined using actual asset gains or losses over the prior three year period, is used to calculate the amount\nof deferred asset gains or losses to be amortized. These asset gains or losses, along with those resulting from adjustments to our benefit obligation, will be\namortized to expense using the corridor method, where gains and losses are recognized over a period of years to the extent they exceed 10% of the greater\nof plan assets or benefit obligations. This amortization period extended in 2020 due to the freeze of our salaried pension plans to use the average remaining\nlife expectancy of the participants instead of average future service.\nWe recognize on a plan-by-plan basis the funded status of our postretirement benefit plans under GAAP as either an asset recorded within other\nnoncurrent assets or a liability recorded within noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. The GAAP funded status is measured as the\ndifference between the fair value of the plan’s assets and the benefit obligation of the plan.

Specifically, we consider whether we can\ncontrol the underlying asset and have the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits or outputs from the asset. Substantially all of our leases\nare long-term operating leases with fixed payment terms. We do not have significant financing leases. Our right-of-use (ROU) operating lease assets\nrepresent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and our operating lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments. ROU\noperating lease assets are recorded in other noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease liabilities are recorded in other current\nliabilities or other noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet based on their contractual due dates.\nBoth the ROU operating lease asset and liability are recognized as of the lease commencement date at the present value of the lease payments over the\nlease term. Most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate that can readily be determined. Therefore, we use a discount rate based on our incremental\nborrowing rate, which is determined using our credit rating and information available as of the commencement date. ROU operating lease assets include\nlease payments made at or before the lease commencement date, net of any lease incentives.\nOur operating lease agreements may include options to extend the lease term or terminate it early. We include options to extend or terminate leases in\nthe ROU operating lease asset and liability when it is reasonably certain we will exercise these\n87\n\n\nTable of Contents\noptions. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is included in cost of sales on our consolidated statement of\nearnings.\nWe have operating lease arrangements with lease and non-lease components. The non-lease components in our arrangements are not significant when\ncompared to the lease components. For all operating leases, we account for the lease and non-lease components as a single component. Additionally, for\ncertain equipment leases, we apply a portfolio approach to recognize operating lease ROU assets and liabilities. We evaluate ROU assets for impairment\nconsistent with our property, plant and equipment policy (see Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies).\nWe generally enter into operating lease agreements for facilities, land and equipment. Our ROU operating lease assets were $1.0 billion at\nDecember 31, 2020. Operating lease liabilities were $1.1 billion, of which $841 million were classified as noncurrent, at December 31, 2020",

Accordingly, unless otherwise indicated below in our discussion of\nlegal proceedings, a reasonably possible loss or range of loss associated with any individual legal proceeding cannot be estimated.\nLegal Proceedings\nAs a result of our acquisition of Sikorsky, we assumed the defense of and any potential liability for two civil False Claims Act lawsuits pending in the\nU.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. In October 2014, the U.S. Government filed a complaint in intervention in the first suit, which\nwas brought by qui tam relator Mary Patzer, a former Derco Aerospace (Derco) employee. In May 2017, the U.S. Government filed a complaint in\nintervention in the second suit, which was brought by qui tam relator Peter Cimma, a former Sikorsky Support Services, Inc. (SSSI) employee. In\nNovember 2017, the Court consolidated the cases into a single action for discovery and trial.\nThe U.S. Government alleges that Sikorsky and two of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Derco and SSSI, violated the civil False Claims Act and the\nTruth in Negotiations Act in connection with a contract the U.S. Navy awarded to SSSI in June 2006 to support the Navy’s T-34 and T-44 fixed-wing\nturboprop training aircraft. SSSI subcontracted with Derco, primarily to procure and manage spare parts for the training aircraft. The U.S. Government\ncontends that SSSI overbilled the Navy on the contract as the result of Derco’s use of prohibited cost-plus-percentage-of-cost pricing to add profit and\noverhead costs as a percentage of the price of the spare parts that Derco procured and then sold to SSSI. The U.S. Government also alleges that Derco’s\nclaims to SSSI, SSSI’s claims to the Navy, and SSSI’s yearly Certificates of Final Indirect Costs from 2006 through 2012 were false and that SSSI\nsubmitted inaccurate cost or pricing data in violation of the Truth in Negotiations Act for a sole-sourced, follow-on “bridge” contract. The U.S.\nGovernment’s complaints assert common law claims for breach of contract and unjust enrichment.\nThe U.S. Government further alleged violations of the Anti-Kickback Act and False Claims Act based on a monthly “chargeback,” through which\nSSSI billed Derco for the cost of certain SSSI personnel, allegedly in exchange for SSSI’s permitting a pricing arrangement that was “highly favorable” to\nDerco. On January 12, 2018, the Corporation filed a partial motion to dismiss intended to narrow the U.S. Government’s claims, including by seeking\ndismissal of the Anti-Kickback Act alle",

The District Court granted these motions, in part, on July 20, 2018, dismissing the Government’s\nclaims under the Anti-Kickback Act and dismissing Cimma as a party to the litigation.\nThe U.S. Government seeks damages of approximately $52 million, subject to trebling, plus statutory penalties. We believe that we have legal and\nfactual defenses to the U.S. Government’s remaining claims. Although we continue to evaluate our liability and exposure, we do not currently believe that\nit is probable that we will incur a material loss.

(LMSI) and a current Lockheed Martin vice president. The dollar amount of damages sought is not specified but DOJ seeks\ntreble damages with respect to the False Claims Act and penalties that are subject to doubling under the Anti-Kickback Act. The allegations relate primarily\nto information technology services performed by LMSI under a subcontract to MSA and the pricing by MSA and LMSI of those services as well as\nLockheed Martin’s payment of standard incentive compensation to certain employees who were seconded to MSA, including the vice president. MSA is a\njoint venture that holds a prime contract to provide infrastructure support services at DOE’s Hanford facility.

The MTA filed an answer and counterclaim alleging that we breached the contract and subsequently terminated the contract for\nalleged default. The primary damages sought by the MTA are the costs to complete the contract and potential re-procurement costs. While we are unable to\nestimate the cost of another contractor to complete the contract and the costs of re-procurement, we note that our contract with the MTA had a total value of\n$323 million, of which $241 million was paid to us, and that the MTA is seeking damages of approximately $190 million. We dispute the MTA’s\nallegations and are defending against them. Additionally, following an investigation, our sureties on a performance bond related to this matter, who were\nrepresented by independent counsel, concluded that the MTA’s termination of the contract was improper. Finally, our declaratory judgment action was later\namended to include claims for monetary damages against the MTA of approximately $95 million. This matter was taken under submission by the District\nCourt in December 2014, after a five-week bench trial and the filing of post-trial pleadings by the parties.

The fair values of mutual funds and certain\nother securities are determined by reference to the quoted market price per unit in active markets multiplied by the number of units held without\nconsideration of transaction costs. The fair values of U.S. Government and other securities are determined using pricing models that use observable inputs\n(e.g., interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals), bids provided by brokers or dealers or quoted prices of securities with\nsimilar characteristics. The fair values of derivative instruments, which consist of foreign currency forward contracts, including embedded derivatives, and\ninterest rate swap contracts, are primarily determined based on the present value of future cash flows using model-derived valuations that use observable\ninputs such as interest rates, credit spreads and foreign currency exchange rates.\nIn addition to the financial instruments listed in the table above, we hold other financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, receivables,\naccounts payable and debt and commercial paper. The carrying amounts for cash and cash equivalents, receivables and accounts payable approximated\ntheir fair values. The estimated fair value of our outstanding debt was $16.9 billion and $15.9 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019. The outstanding\nprincipal amount was $13.3 billion and $13.8 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, excluding $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion of unamortized discounts and\nissuance costs at December 31, 2020 and 2019.

A company’s\ninternal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded\nas necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures\nof the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance\nregarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the\nfinancial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any\nevaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree\nof compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nTysons, Virginia\nJanuary 28, 2021\n108\n\n\nTable of Contents\nITEM 9B.

In 2020, 74% of our $65.4 billion in net sales were from the U.S.\nGovernment, either as a prime contractor or as a subcontractor (including 64% from the Department of Defense (DoD)), 25% were from international\ncustomers (including foreign military sales (FMS) contracted through the U.S. Government) and 1% were from U.S. commercial and other customers. Our\nmain areas of focus are in defense, space, intelligence, homeland security and information technology, including cybersecurity.\nWe operate in an environment characterized by both complexity in global security and continuing economic pressures in the U.S. and globally. A\nsignificant component of our strategy in this environment is to focus on program execution, improving the quality and predictability of the delivery of our\nproducts and services, and placing security capability quickly into the hands of our U.S. and international customers at affordable prices. Recognizing that\nour customers are resource constrained, we are endeavoring to develop and extend our portfolio domestically in a disciplined manner with a focus on\nadjacent markets close to our core capabilities, as well as growing our international sales. We continue to focus on affordability initiatives. We also expect\nto continue to innovate and invest in technologies to fulfill new mission requirements for our customers, including through acquisitions, and invest in our\npeople so that we have the technical skills necessary to succeed.\nWe operate in four business segments: Aeronautics, Missiles and Fire Control (MFC), Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) and Space. We organize our\nbusiness segments based on the nature of the products and services offered.\nStrategic Action\nOn December 20, 2020, we entered into an agreement to acquire Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, Inc.

Changes within the industry we operate in, such\nas vertical integration by our peers, could negatively impact us. We often form teams with our competitors in efforts to provide our customers with the best\nmix of capabilities to address specific requirements. In some areas of our business, customer requirements are changing to encourage expanded\ncompetition. Principal factors of competition include the value of our products and services to the customer; technical and management capability; the\nability to develop and implement complex, integrated system architectures; total cost of ownership; our demonstrated ability to execute and perform against\ncontract requirements; and our ability to provide timely and cost effective solutions. Technological advances in such areas as additive manufacturing, data\nanalytics, digital engineering, artificial intelligence, advanced materials, autonomy and robotics, and new business models such as commercial access to\nspace are enabling new factors of competition for both traditional and non-traditional competitors.\nThe competition for international sales is generally subject to U.S. Government stipulations (e.g., export restrictions, market access, technology\ntransfer, industrial cooperation and contracting practices). We may compete against U.S. and non-U.S. companies (or teams) for contract awards by\ninternational governments. International competitions also may be subject to different laws or contracting practices of international governments that may\naffect how we structure our bid for the procurement. In many international procurements, the purchasing government’s relationship with the U.S. and its\nindustrial cooperation programs are important factors in determining the outcome of a competition. It is common for international customers to require\ncontractors to comply with their industrial cooperation regulations, sometimes referred to as offset requirements, and we have entered into foreign offset\nagreements as part of securing some international business.

As part of this program, we track employee health and\nsafety measures, including quarterly and yearly targets related to the number of injury and illness incidents that occur, those incidents that result in days\nlost, and the number of days lost due to workplace injuries. During 2020, these metrics were negatively impacted by the absence from work and delays in\nthe return to work related to the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to COVID-19, we took action to protect our employees’ safety and health, including by\nequipping employees with personal protective equipment, establishing minimum staffing and social distancing policies, sanitizing workspaces more\nfrequently, adopting alternate work schedules and instituting other measures aimed at minimizing the transmission of COVID-19 while sustaining\nproduction and related services. In addition, we have implemented a flexible teleworking policy for employees who can meet our customer commitments\nremotely, and a significant portion of our workforce began teleworking in mid-March 2020 and were continuing to telework as of December 31, 2020.

We expect to continue to derive most of our\nsales from work performed under U.S. Government contracts. Those contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of Congressional\nappropriations. Congress usually appropriates funds on a fiscal year (FY) basis even though contract performance may extend over many years.\nConsequently, contracts are often partially funded initially and additional funds are committed only as Congress makes further appropriations. If we incur\ncosts in excess of funds obligated on a contract, we may be at risk for reimbursement of those costs unless and until additional funds are obligated to the\ncontract.\nThe F-35 program, which consists of multiple development, production and sustainment contracts, is our largest program. It represented 28% of our\ntotal net sales in 2020. A decision by the U.S. Government or other governments to cut spending on this program or reduce or delay planned orders would\nhave an adverse impact on our business and results of operations. Given the size and complexity of the F-35 program, we anticipate that there will be\ncontinual reviews related to aircraft performance, program schedule, cost, and requirements as part of the DoD, Congressional, and international partners’\noversight and budgeting processes. Current program challenges include, but are not limited to, supplier and partner performance (including COVID-19\nrelated challenges), software development, the availability and receipt of funding for contracts on a timely basis, execution of future flight tests and\nfindings resulting from testing and operating the aircraft, the level of cost associated with life-cycle operations and sustainment and warranties, continuing\nto reduce the unit production costs, and achieving cost targets.\nBudget uncertainty, the risk of future budget cuts, the potential for U.S. government shutdowns, the use of continuing resolutions, and the federal debt\nceiling can adversely affect our industry and the funding for our programs.

As funds are typically appropriated on a fiscal year basis, and because the costs of a termination for convenience may exceed the\ncosts of continuing a program in a given fiscal year, programs occasionally do not have sufficient funds appropriated to cover the termination costs if the\ngovernment were to terminate them for convenience. Under such circumstances, the U.S. Government could assert that it is not required to appropriate\nadditional funding.\nA termination arising out of our default may expose us to liability and have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and\norders. In addition, on those contracts for which we are teamed with others and are not the prime contractor, the U.S. Government could terminate a prime\ncontract under which we are a subcontractor, notwithstanding the fact that our performance and the quality of the products or services we delivered were\nconsistent with our contractual obligations as a subcontractor. In the case of termination for default, the U.S. Government could make claims to reduce the\ncontract value or recover its procurement costs and could assess other special penalties. Under such circumstances we may have rights and there may be\nremedial actions available to us under applicable laws and the FAR.\nAdditionally, our programs for the U.S. Government often operate for periods of time under Undefinitized Contract Actions (UCAs), which means that\nwe begin performing our obligations before the terms, specifications or price are finally agreed to between the parties. The U.S. Government has the ability\nto unilaterally definitize contracts, which, absent a successful appeal, obligates us to perform under terms and conditions imposed by the U.S. Government.\nThe U.S. Government has unilaterally definitized contracts with us in the past, most notably the F-35 LRIP 9 contract in 2016 and more recently two FMS\nF-16 upgrade proposals in 2020, and may do so in the future.

Our customers also may pursue non-traditional contract provisions or contract types in negotiation of contracts. The\nU.S. Government’s preference for fixed-price contracting has resulted in what we believe to be the inappropriate application of fixed-priced contracting\nmethods to development programs. By their nature, the technical challenges, costs and timing of development programs are difficult to estimate and the use\nof fixed-price instead of cost-reimbursable contracts for such programs increases the financial risk to the contractor. This increased risk may lead to losses\non fixed price development programs or may cause us not to bid on future fixed-price development programs, which could adversely affect our future\ngrowth prospects and financial performance. In addition, given the customer’s emphasis on cost, even if we effectively manage program life-cycle and\nsustainment costs and meet customer affordability targets, the customer may elect to recompete programs at the end of existing contracts, which may result\nin a lost business opportunity.

Lockheed Martin\nexpects the U.S. Government to continue to engage Turkey on these issues, but we have no indication that the sanctions will be removed, that additional\nsanctions will not be imposed or that Turkey will not issue reciprocal sanctions. While we do not expect the current sanctions to have a material effect on\nour current programs, additional sanctions, reciprocal sanctions or other actions, could be material to our operations, operating results, financial position or\ncash flows.\nIn addition to having committed to purchase up to 100 F-35 aircraft, six of which had completed production at the time of removal, Turkish suppliers\ncontinue to produce component parts for the F-35 program, some of which are single-sourced.

Nevertheless, due to the evolving nature of these security threats and the national security aspects of much of the\ndata we protect, the impact of any future incident cannot be predicted.\nIn addition to cyber threats, we experience threats to the security of our facilities and employees and threats from terrorist acts. We also typically work\ncooperatively with our customers, suppliers, subcontractors, joint venture partners and entities we acquire, whom are subject to similar threats, to seek to\nminimize the impact of cyber threats, other security threats or business disruptions.

The impact of these plans on our earnings may be volatile in that the amount of expense we record for our\npostretirement benefit plans may materially change from year to year because the calculations are sensitive to changes in several key economic\nassumptions including interest rates and rates of return on plan assets, other actuarial assumptions including participant longevity (also known as mortality)\nand employee turnover, as well as the timing of cash funding. Changes in these factors, including actual returns on plan assets, may also affect our plan\nfunding, cash flow and stockholders’ equity. In addition, the funding of our plans and recovery of costs on our contracts, as described below, may also be\nsubject to changes caused by legislative or regulatory actions.\nWith regard to cash flow, we make substantial cash contributions to our plans as required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974\n(ERISA), as amended by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA). We generally are able to recover these contributions related to our plans as allowable\ncosts on our U.S. Government contracts, including FMS. However, there is a lag between the time when we contribute cash to our plans under pension\nfunding rules and when we recover pension costs under U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS). We also may not be successful in our efforts\nto reduce the volatility of our outstanding pension obligations and to accelerate CAS recovery and recover associated costs from the U.S. Government.\nFor more information on how these factors could impact earnings, financial position, cash flow and stockholders’ equity, see “Critical Accounting\nPolicies - Postretirement Benefit Plans” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and “Note 12 –\nPostretirement Benefit Plans” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOur estimates and projections may prove to be inaccurate and certain of our assets may be at risk of future impairment.\nThe accounting for some of our most significant activities is based on judgments and estimates, which are complex and subject to many variables.

As described in Item 1A, Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K,\nwe rely on other companies and the U.S. Government to provide materials, major components and products, and to perform a portion of the services that\nare provided to our customers under the terms of most of our contracts. Many of these suppliers also supply parts for commercial aviation businesses which\nhave been more significantly impacted by the pandemic due to the impacts on these markets. Global supply chain disruption caused by the response to\nCOVID-19 has impacted some of our programs and could impact our ability to perform on our contracts, in particular in instances where there is not a\nqualified second source of supply. We have identified a number of suppliers that have experienced delivery impacts due to COVID-19 and have been\nworking to manage those impacts. However, if alternatives or other mitigations are not effective, deliveries and other milestones on affected programs\ncould be adversely impacted.\nOur work in production facilities and labs has continued throughout the pandemic, consistent with guidance from federal, state and local officials to\nminimize the spread of COVID-19. We have taken actions to equip employees with personal protective equipment, establish minimum staffing and social\ndistancing policies, sanitize workspaces more frequently, adopt alternate work schedules and institute other measures aimed to sustain production and\nrelated services while minimizing the transmission of COVID-19. In addition, we have implemented a flexible teleworking policy for employees who can\nmeet our customer commitments remotely, and a significant portion of our workforce is currently teleworking.

The outlook for 2021 assumes continued support and funding of our programs, known impacts of COVID-19, and a statutory tax\nrate of 21%. Additionally, it assumes that there will not be significant reductions in customer budgets, changes in funding priorities and that the U.S.\nGovernment will not operate under a continuing resolution for an extended period in which new contract and program starts are restricted. Changes in\ncircumstances may require us to revise our assumptions, which could materially change our current estimate of 2021 net sales, operating margin and cash\nflows.\nWe expect a total net FAS/CAS pension benefit of approximately $2.3 billion in 2021 based on a 2.50% discount rate (a 75 basis point decrease from\nthe end of 2019), an approximate 16.5% return on plan assets in 2020, and a 7.00% expected long-term rate of return on plan assets in future years, among\nother assumptions. We expect to make contributions of approximately $1.0 billion to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2021 and anticipate\nrecovering approximately $2.1 billion of CAS pension cost.\nPortfolio Shaping Activities\nWe continuously strive to strengthen our portfolio of products and services to meet the current and future needs of our customers. We accomplish this\nin part by our independent research and development activities and through acquisition, divestiture and internal realignment activities.\nWe selectively pursue the acquisition of businesses and investments at attractive valuations that will expand or complement our current portfolio and\nallow access to new customers or technologies.

The appropriations provide $741 billion in discretionary funding for national defense (includes DoD funding\nand defense-related spending in energy and water development, homeland security, and military construction appropriations), of which $671 billion is in\nbase funding and $69 billion is Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO)/emergency funding (OCO and emergency supplemental funding do not count\ntoward discretionary spending caps). Of the $741 billion, the DoD was allocated $704 billion, composed of $635 billion in base funding and $69 billion in\nOCO and emergency funding. The appropriations adhere to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 (BBA 2019), which increased the spending limits for both\ndefense and non-defense discretionary funds for the final two years (FY 2020 and FY 2021) of the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA).\nThe Appropriations Act also provides stimulus funds to individuals, businesses, and hospitals in response to the economic distress caused by the\ncoronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Additionally, it extends Section 3610 of the CARES Act until March 31, 2021, which gives DoD and federal agencies\ndiscretion to reimburse contractors for any paid leave, including sick leave, a contractor provides during the pandemic to keep its employees in a ready\nstate.\nInternational",

To accomplish this growth, we continue to focus on strengthening our\nrelationships internationally through partnerships and joint technology efforts. We conduct business with international customers through each of our\nbusiness segments through either FMS or direct sales to international customers. See Item 1A - Risk Factors for a discussion of risks related to international\nsales.\nInternational customers accounted for 31% of Aeronautics’ 2020 net sales. There continues to be strong international interest in the F-35 program,\nwhich includes commitments from the U.S. Government and seven international partner countries and six international customers, as well as expressions of\ninterest from other countries. The U.S. Government and the partner countries continue to work together on the design, testing, production, and sustainment\nof the F-35 program. Other areas of international expansion at our Aeronautics business segment include the F-16 and C-130J programs. Aeronautics\nreceived contracts in 2020 with Bulgaria and Taiwan for new F-16 aircraft, extending work beyond 2025. The C-130J Super Hercules aircraft continued to\ndraw interest from various international customers, including a contract in 2020 from New Zealand.\nIn 2020, international customers accounted for 25% of MFC’s net sales. Our MFC business segment continues to generate significant international\ninterest, most notably in the air and missile defense product line, which produces the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) and Terminal High Altitude\nArea Defense (THAAD) systems. The PAC-3 family of missiles are the only combat proven Hit-to-Kill interceptors that defend against incoming threats,\nincluding tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and aircraft. Fourteen nations have chosen PAC-3 Cost Reduction Initiative (CRI) and PAC-3 Missile\nSegment Enhancement (MSE) to provide missile defense capabilities. THAAD is an integrated system designed to protect against high altitude ballistic\nmissile threats. Additionally, we continue to see international demand for our tactical missile and fire control products, where we received orders for\nprecision fires systems from Poland and Romania; and Apache and Low Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infrared for Night (LANTIRN ) systems for\nQatar.\nIn 2020, international customers accounted for 25% of RMS’ net sales.

Production of the aircraft is\nexpected to continue for many years given the U.S. Government’s current inventory objective of 2,456 aircraft for the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Marine Corps,\nand U.S. Navy; commitments from our seven international partner countries and six international customers; as well as expressions of interest from other\ncountries.\nDuring 2020, the F-35 program completed several milestones both domestically and internationally. The U.S. Government continued testing the\naircraft, including ship trials, mission and weapons systems evaluations, and the F-35 fleet recently surpassed 355,000 flight hours. During the second half\nof 2020, the U.S. Government awarded the production of 18 F-35 Block Buy aircraft in addition to the 448 aircraft previously awarded.

See the discussion\nin Business Overview - COVID-19 and Item 1A, Risk Factors.\nAs a result of Turkey accepting delivery of the Russian S-400 air and missile defense system, the U.S. Government removed Turkey from the F-35\nprogram in 2019 and in December 2020 imposed sanctions on Turkey’s defense procurement agency (SSB) and certain of the agency’s officers under the\nCountering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA). The primary sanction imposed was a restriction on all new U.S. export licenses and\nauthorizations for any goods or technology transferred to the SSB, but does not apply to current, valid export licenses and authorizations. Lockheed Martin\nexpects the U.S. Government to continue to engage Turkey on these issues, but we have no indication that the sanctions will be removed, that additional\nsanctions will not be imposed or that Turkey will not issue reciprocal sanctions. While we do not expect the current sanctions to have a material effect on\nour current programs, additional sanctions, reciprocal sanctions or other actions, could be material to our operations, operating results, financial position or\ncash flows.\nIn addition to having committed to purchase up to 100 F-35 aircraft, six of which had completed production at the time of removal, Turkish suppliers\ncontinue to produce component parts for the F-35 program, some of which are single-sourced. To minimize the risks of disruption of our supply chain and\nensure continuity of F-35 production, we have been working closely with the DoD and supporting activities to identify and engage alternate suppliers for\nthe component parts produced by Turkish suppliers. We have made significant progress transitioning to non-Turkish suppliers, but due to the procedure to\nqualify new parts and suppliers, this collaborative process between DoD and Lockheed Martin is ongoing. During 2020, the DoD publicly confirmed that\nTurkish suppliers would be permitted to provide certain components for the F-35 through 2022. While the transition timeline is an important first step, it is\nequally important that our replacement capacity is re-established so that production is not impacted. Efforts to date have significantly reduced our risk, but\nfinal resolution on a limited number of remaining components could affect F-35 deliveries, and any accelerated work stoppage would impact cost.

This approach is consistent throughout the life cycle of our contracts, as management assesses the bidding of each contract by focusing on net\nsales and operating profit and monitors performance on our contracts in a similar manner through their completion.\nWe regularly provide customers with reports of our costs as the contract progresses. The cost information in the reports is accumulated in a manner\nspecified by the requirements of each contract. For example, cost data provided to a customer for a product would typically align to the subcomponents of\nthat product (such as a wing-box on an aircraft) and for services would align to the type of work being performed (such as aircraft sustainment). Our\ncontracts generally allow for the recovery of costs in the pricing of our products and services. Most of our contracts are bid and negotiated with our\ncustomers under circumstances in which we are required to disclose our estimated total costs to provide the product or service. This approach for\nnegotiating contracts with our U.S. Government customers generally allows for recovery of our actual costs plus a reasonable profit margin. We also may\nenter into long-term supply contracts for certain materials or components to coincide with the production schedule of certain products and to ensure their\navailability at known unit prices.\nMany of our contracts span several years and include highly complex technical requirements. At the outset of a contract, we identify and monitor risks\nto the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract and assess the effects of those risks on our estimates of total costs to complete\nthe contract. The estimates consider the technical requirements (e.g., a newly-developed product versus a mature product), the schedule and associated\ntasks (e.g., the number and type of milestone events) and costs (e.g., material, labor, subcontractor, overhead and the estimated costs to fulfill our industrial\ncooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, required under certain contracts with international customers). The initial profit\nbooking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements, schedule and costs in the initial estimated total\ncosts to complete the contract. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the\ntechnical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract, which decreases the estimated total costs to complete the contract. Conversely, our profit booking rates\nmay decrease if the estimated total costs to complete the contract increase. All of the estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract\nand may affect the profit booking rate.\nWe have a number of programs that are designated as classified by the U.S. Government which cannot be specifically described.

Changes in volume refer to increases or decreases in sales or\noperating profit resulting from varying production activity levels, deliveries or service levels on individual contracts. Volume changes in segment operating\nprofit are typically based on the current profit booking rate for a particular contract.\nIn addition, comparability of our segment sales, operating profit and operating margin may be impacted favorably or unfavorably by changes in profit\nbooking rates on our contracts for which we recognize revenue over time using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method to measure progress\ntowards completion. Increases in the profit booking rates, typically referred to as risk retirements, usually relate to revisions in the estimated total costs to\nfulfill the performance obligations that reflect improved conditions on a particular contract. Conversely, conditions on a particular contract may deteriorate,\nresulting in an increase in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations and a reduction in the profit booking rate. Increases or decreases in\nprofit booking rates are recognized in the current period and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. Segment operating profit and margin may\nalso be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other items, which may or may not impact sales. Favorable items may include the positive resolution of\ncontractual matters, cost recoveries on severance and restructuring charges, insurance recoveries and gains on sales of assets. Unfavorable items may\ninclude the adverse resolution of contractual matters; restructuring charges, except for significant severance actions, which are excluded from segment\noperating results; reserves for disputes; certain asset impairments; and losses on sales of certain assets.\nAs previously disclosed, we are responsible for a prog",

These agreements also may be satisfied through our use of cash for such activities as\npurchasing supplies from in-country vendors, providing financial support for in-country projects, establishment of joint ventures with local companies and\nbuilding or leasing facilities for in-country operations.

Satisfaction of our offset obligations are included in the estimates of our total costs\nto complete the contract and may impact our sales, profitability and cash flows. Our ability to recover investments on our consolidated balance sheet that\nwe make to satisfy offset obligations is generally dependent upon the successful operation of ventures that we do not control and may involve products and\nservices that are dissimilar to our business activities.

Typically, we enter into three types of cost-reimbursable contracts: cost-plus-award-fee, cost-plus-incentive-fee, and cost-\nplus-fixed-fee. Cost-plus-award-fee contracts provide for an award fee that varies within specified limits based on the customer’s assessment of our\nperformance against a predetermined set of criteria, such as targets based on cost, quality, technical and schedule criteria. Cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts\nprovide for reimbursement of costs plus a fee, which is adjusted by a formula based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs (i.e.,\nincentive based on cost) or reimbursement of costs plus an incentive to exceed stated performance targets (i.e., incentive based on performance). The fixed-\nfee in a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract is negotiated at the inception of the contract and that fixed-fee does not vary with actual costs.\nWe assess each contract at its inception to determine whether it should be combined with other contracts. When making this determination, we\nconsider factors such as whether two or more contracts were negotiated and executed at or near the same\n(a)\n(a)\n54\n\n\nTable of Contents\ntime or were negotiated with an overall profit objective. If combined, we treat the combined contracts as a single contract for revenue recognition purposes.\nWe evaluate the products or services promised in each contract at inception to determine whether the contract should be accounted for as having one\nor more performance obligations. The products and services in our contracts are typically not distinct from one another due to their complex relationships\nand the significant contract management functions required to perform under the contract. Accordingly, our contracts are typically accounted for as one\nperformance obligation. In limited cases, our contracts have more than one distinct performance obligation, which occurs when we perform activities that\nare not highly complex or interrelated or involve different product lifecycles. Significant judgment is required in determining performance obligations, and\nthese decisions could change the amount of revenue and profit recorded in a given period.

We analyze the risk of a significant\nrevenue reversal and if necessary constrain the amount of variable consideration recognized in order to mitigate this risk.\nAt the inception of a contract we estimate the transaction price based on our current rights and do not contemplate future modifications (including\nunexercised options) or follow-on contracts until they become legally enforceable. Contracts are often subsequently modified to include changes in\nspecifications, requirements or price, which may create new or change existing enforceable rights and obligations. Depending on the nature of the\nmodification, we consider whether to account for the modification as an adjustment to the existing contract or as a separate contract. Generally,\nmodifications to our contracts are not distinct from the existing contract due to the significant integration and interrelated tasks provided in the context of\nthe contract. Therefore, such modifications are accounted for as if they were part of the existing contract and recognized as a cumulative adjustment to\nrevenue.\nFor contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on the estimated\nstandalone selling price of the product or service underlying each performance obligation. The standalone selling price represents the amount we would sell\nthe product or service to a customer on a standalone basis (i.e., not bundled with any other products or services). Our contracts with the U.S. Government,\nincluding FMS contracts, are subject to FAR and the price is typically based on estimated or actual costs plus a reasonable profit margin. As a result of\nthese regulations, the standalone selling price of products or services in our contracts with the U.S. Government and FMS contracts are typically equal to\nthe selling price stated in the contract.\nFor non-U.S. Government contracts with multiple performance obligations, we evaluate whether the stated selling prices for the products or services\nrepresent their standalone selling prices. We primarily sell customized solutions unique to a customer’s specifications. When it is necessary to allocate the\ntransaction price to multiple performance obligations, we typically use the expected cost plus a reasonable profit margin to estimate the standalone selling\nprice of each product or service.

In these situations, the\nobservable standalone sales transactions are used to determine the standalone selling price.\nWe recognize revenue as performance obligations are satisfied and the customer obtains control of the products and services.

For most non-U.S. Government contracts, primarily\ninternational direct commercial contracts, continuous transfer of control to our customer is supported because we deliver products that do not have an\nalternative use to us and if our customer were to terminate the contract for reasons other than our non-performance we would have the right to recover\ndamages which would include, among other potential damages, the right to payment for our work performed to date plus a reasonable profit.\nFor performance obligations to deliver products with continuous transfer of control to the customer, revenue is recognized based on the extent of\nprogress towards completion of the performance obligation, generally using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress for our\ncontracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer as we incur costs on our contracts.

The initial profit booking rate of each\ncontract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements, schedule and costs in the initial estimated total costs to complete the\ncontract. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the technical, schedule and\ncost aspects of the contract, which decreases the estimated total costs to complete the contract or may increase the variable consideration we expect to\nreceive on the contract.

Increases or decreases in profit\nbooking rates are recognized in the current period and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. Segment operating profit and margin may also be\nimpacted favorably or unfavorably by other items, which may or may not impact sales. Favorable items may include the positive resolution of contractual\nmatters, cost recoveries on severance and restructuring charges, insurance recoveries and gains on sales of assets. Unfavorable items may include the\nadverse resolution of contractual matters; restructuring charges, except for significant severance actions, which are excluded from segment operating\nresults; reserves for disputes; certain asset impairments; and losses on sales of certain assets.\nOther Contract Accounting Considerations\nThe majority of our sales are driven by pricing based on c",

During December 2020, Lockheed Martin, through its master\nretirement trust, purchased an irrevocable group annuity contract from an insurance company (referred to as a buy-out contract) for $1.4 billion to transfer\nthe related, outstanding defined benefit pension obligations. As a result of this transaction, we were relieved of all responsibility for these pension\nobligations and the insurance company is now required to pay and administer the retirement benefits owed to approximately 13,500 U.S. retirees and\nbeneficiaries, with no change to the amount, timing or form of monthly retirement benefit payments. Although the transaction was treated as a settlement\nfor accounting purposes, we did not recognize a loss on the settlement in earnings associated with the transaction because total settlements during 2020 for\nthe affected pension plans were less than the plans’ service and interest cost in 2020.\nA second contract was also purchased from an insurance company for $793 million that will reimburse the plan for all future benefit payments related\nto approximately 2,500 U.S. retirees and beneficiaries (referred to as a buy-in contract). The covered retirees and beneficiaries and buy-in contract were\nspun-off to the plan established in December 2018 for the contract purchased at that time similarly structured as a buy-in; the buy-in contracts are the sole\nassets of that plan. Under the arrangement, the plan remains responsible for paying the benefits for the covered retirees and beneficiaries and the insurance\ncompany will reimburse the plan as those benefits are paid. As a result, there is no net ongoing cash flow to the plan for the covered retirees and\nbeneficiaries as the cost of providing the benefits is funded by the buy-in contract; effectively locking in the cost of the benefits and eliminating future\nvolatility of the benefit obligation, while also providing the option to convert to a buy-out. The buy-in contract was purchased using assets from the pension\ntrust and is accounted for at fair value as an investment of the trust. These transactions had no impact on our 2020 FAS pension expense or CAS pension\ncost.\nSince December 2018, Lockheed Martin, through its master retirement trust, has purchased total contracts (both buy-in and buy-out) for approximately\n$6.7 billion related to our outstanding defined benefit pension obligations eliminating pension plan volatility for approximately 77,000 retirees and\nbeneficiaries and annually required Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation (PBGC) premiums of approximately $55 milli",

The amounts we record are measured using actuarial valuations, which are dependent upon key\nassumptions such as discount rates, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, participant longevity, employee turnover and the health care cost\ntrend rates for our retiree medical plans. The assumptions we make affect both the calculation of the benefit obligations as of the measurement date and the\ncalculation of net periodic benefit cost in subsequent periods. When reassessing these assumptions, we consider past and current market conditions and\nmake judgments about future market trends. We also consider factors such as the timing and amounts of expected contributions to the plans and benefit\npayments to plan participants.\nWe continue to use a single weighted average discount rate approach when calculating our consolidated benefit obligations related to our defined\nbenefit pension plans resulting in 2.50% at December 31, 2020, compared to 3.25% at December 31, 2019. We utilized a single weighted average discount\nrate of 2.375% when calculating our benefit obligations related to our retiree medical and life insurance plans at December 31, 2020, compared to 3.25% at\nDecember 31, 2019. We evaluate several data points in order to arrive at an appropriate single weighted average discount rate, including results from cash\nflow models, quoted rates from long-term bond indices and changes in long-term bond rates over the past year. As part of our evaluation, we calculate the\napproximate average yields on corporate bonds rated AA or better selected to match our projected postretirement benefit plan cash flows. The decrease in\nthe discount rate from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020 resulted in an increase in the projected benefit obligations of our qualified defined benefit\npension plans of approximately $4.9 billion at December 31, 2020.\nWe utilized an expected l",

The long-term rate of\nreturn assumption represents the expected long-term rate of return on the funds invested or to be invested, to provide for the benefits included in the benefit\nobligations. This assumption is based on several factors including historical market index returns, the anticipated long-term allocation of plan assets, the\nhistorical return data for the trust funds, plan expenses and the potential to outperform market index returns. The difference between the long-term rate of\nreturn on plan assets assumption we select and the actual return on plan assets in any given year affects both the funded status of our benefit plans and the\ncalculation of FAS pension expense in subsequent periods. Although the actual return in any specific year likely will differ from the assumption, the\naverage expected return over a long-term future horizon should be approximately equal to the assumption. Any variance each year should not, by itself,\nsuggest that the assumption should be changed. Patterns of variances are reviewed over time, and then combined with expectations for the future. As a\nresult, changes in this assumption are less frequent than changes in the discount rate. The actual investment return for our qualified defined benefit plans\nduring 2020 of $5.6 billion based on an actual rate of approximately 16.5% improved plan assets more than the $2.3 billion expected return based on our\n7.00% long-term rate of return assumption.\nIn October 2020, the Society of Actuaries published revised longevity assumptions that refined its prior studies.

For selected reporting units where we use the\nqualitative approach, we perform a qualitative evaluation of events and circumstances impacting the reporting unit to determine the likelihood of goodwill\nimpairment. Based on that qualitative evaluation, if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying\namount, no further evaluation is necessary. Otherwise we perform a quantitative impairment test. We perform quantitative tests for most reporting units at\nleast once every three years. However, for certain reporting units we may perform a quantitative impairment test every year.\nTo perform the quantitative impairment test, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of a\nreporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. If the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill,\nexceeds its fair value, a goodwill impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.

As of the date of our annual impairment test, the fair value of our Sikorsky reporting unit exceeded\nits carrying value, which included goodwill of $2.7 billion, by a margin of approximately 30%. The fair value of our Sikorsky reporting unit can be\nsignificantly impacted by changes in expected future orders, general market pressures, including U.S. Government budgetary constraints, discount rates,\nlong term growth rates, and changes in U.S. (federal or state) or foreign tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, including those\nwith retroactive effect, along with other significant judgments.

Due to the\nmany variables inherent in the estimation of a reporting unit’s fair value and the relative size of our recorded goodwill, differences in assumptions could\nhave a material effect on the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period.\nAcquired intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to annual impairment testing. This testing compares\ncarrying value to fair value and, when appropriate, the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we performed\nour annual impairment test, and the results of that test indicated no impairment existed. Finite-lived intangibles are amortized to expense over the\napplicable useful lives, ranging from three to 20 years, based on the nature of the asset and the underlying pattern of economic benefit as reflected by future\nnet cash inflows. We perform an impairment test of finite-lived intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value may\nbe impaired. If events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of a finite-lived intangible may be impaired, the sum of the undiscounted\nfuture cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset group would be compared to the asset group’s carrying value. If the asset group’s carrying\namount exceed the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows, we would determine the fair value of the asset group and record an impairment loss in net\nearnings.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee “Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (under the caption “Recent Accounting\nPronouncements”).\n62\n\n\nTable of Contents\nITEM  7A.

We believe that they provide us with\nsufficient access to the general and trade credit we require to conduct our business. We continue to closely monitor the financial market environment and\nactively manage counterparty exposure to minimize the potential impact from adverse developments with any single credit provider while ensuring\navailability of, and access to, sufficient credit resources.\nOur main exposure to market risk relates to interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and market prices on certain equity securities. Our financial\ninstruments that are subject to interest rate risk principally include fixed-rate long-term debt and commercial paper, if issued. The estimated fair value of\nour outstanding debt was $16.9 billion at December 31, 2020 and the outstanding principal amount was $13.3 billion, excluding unamortized discounts and\nissuance costs of $1.1 billion. A 10% change in the level of interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of our outstanding debt at\nDecember 31, 2020.\nWe use derivative instruments principally to reduce our exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.\nWe do not enter into or hold derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes. We transact business globally and are subject to risks associated with\nchanging foreign currency exchange rates. We enter into foreign currency hedges such as forward and option contracts that change in value as foreign\ncurrency exchange rates change. Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the British pound sterling, the euro, the Canadian dollar and the\nAustralian dollar. These contracts hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions in order to mitigate fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows associated\nwith changes in foreign currency exchange rates. As a result, we do not have material foreign currency transaction exposure, including exposure to the\npound sterling or euro should there be material foreign currency fluctuations due to the United Kingdom departing from the European Union (commonly\nreferred to as Brexit). We designate foreign currency hedges as cash flow hedges. We also are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes primarily\nthrough our borrowing activities. For fixed rate borrowings, we may use variable interest rate swaps, effectively converting fixed rate borrowings to\nvariable rate borrowings in order to hedge changes in the fair value of the debt. These swaps are designated as fair value hedges. For variable rate\nborrowings, we may use fixed interest rate swaps, effectively converting variable rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings in order to mitigate the impact of\ninterest rate changes on earnings.

Adjustments to reflect changes in fair values of derivatives attributable to highly effective hedges are either reflected in earnings and\nlargely offset by corresponding adjustments to the hedged items or reflected net of income taxes in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged\ntransaction is recognized in earnings. Changes in the fair value of the derivatives that are not highly effective, if any, are immediately recognized in\nearnings. The aggregate notional amount of our outstanding interest rate swaps at December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $572 million and $750 million. The\naggregate notional amount of our outstanding foreign currency hedges at December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $3.4 billion and $3.8 billion. At December 31,\n2020 and 2019, the net fair value of our derivative instruments was not material (see “Note 17 – Fair Value Measurements” included in our Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements). A 10% unfavorable exchange rate movement of our foreign currency contracts would not have a material impact on\nthe aggregate net fair value of such contracts or our consolidated financial statements. Additionally, as we enter into foreign currency contracts to hedge\nforeign currency exposure on underlying transactions we believe that any movement on our foreign currency contracts would be offset by movement on the\nunderlying transactions and, therefore, when taken together do not create material risk.\nWe evaluate the credit quality of potential counterparties to derivative transactions and only enter into agreements with those deemed to have\nacceptable credit risk at the time the agreements are executed. Our foreign currency exchange hedge portfolio is diversified across several banks. We\nperiodically monitor changes to counterparty credit quality as well as our concentration of credit exposure to individual counterparties.

As more fully described in Note 1 to\nthe consolidated financial statements, the Corporation generates the majority of its net sales from long-term contracts with its\ncustomers whereby substantially all of the Corporation’s revenue is recognized over time using the percentage-of-completion\ncost-to-cost measure of progress. Under the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress, the Corporation\nmeasures progress towards completion based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the estimated total costs to complete the\nperformance obligation(s) (referred to as the estimate-at-completion analysis). The Corporation estimates profit on these\ncontracts as the difference between total estimated revenues and total estimated cost at completion.\nThe percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions to\nestimate contract sales and costs associated with its contracts with customers. At the outset of a long-term contract, the\nCorporation identifies risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract. Throughout the\ncontract life cycle, the Corporation monitors and assesses the effects of those risks on its estimates of sales and total costs to\ncomplete the contract. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if the Corporation successfully\nretires risks surrounding the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract, which would decrease the estimated total costs\nto complete the contract. Conversely, the profit booking rates may decrease if the estimated total costs to complete the contract\nincrease. Changes to the profit booking rates resulting from changes in estimates could have a material effect on the\nCorporation’s results of operations.\nAuditing the Corporation’s estimate-at-completion analyses used in its revenue recognition process was complex ",

For example, we tested internal controls over management’s review of the estimate-\nat-completion analyses and the significant assumptions underlying the estimated contract value and estimated total costs to\ncomplete. We also tested internal controls that management executes to validate the data used in the estimate-at-completion\nanalyses was complete and accurate.\nTo test the accuracy of the Corporation’s estimate-at-completion analyses, our audit procedures included, among others,\ncomparing estimates of labor costs, subcontractor costs, and materials to historical results of similar contracts, and agreeing the\nkey terms to contract documentation and management’s estimates. We also performed sensitivity analyses over the significant\nassumptions to evaluate the change in the profit booking rates resulting from changes in the assumptions.\nGoodwill Impairment Assessment – Sikorsky Reporting Unit\nDescription of the\nMatter\nAt December 31, 2020, the Corporation’s Sikorsky reporting unit had a goodwill balance of $2.7 billion which represented\napproximately 5.2% of total assets. As discussed in Note 1 and Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, goodwill is tested\nfor impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level using either a qualitative or quantitative approach. Under the\nquantitative approach to test for goodwill impairment, the Corporation compares the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying\namount, including goodwill. Generally, the Corporation estimates the fair value of its reporting units using a combination of a\ndiscounted cash flows analysis and market-based valuation methodologies.\nAuditing management’s annual impairment test over the Sikorsky reporting unit goodwill was complex and highly judgmental\ndue to the significant estimation required in determining the fair value. In particular, the fair value estimate was sensitive to\nsignificant assumptions, such as revenue growth rates, operating margins, cash flows, terminal value, and weighted average cost\nof capital, which are affected by expectations about future market or economic conditions and expected future operating results\nof the Sikorsky business.\n65\n\n\nTable of Contents\nHow We Addressed\nthe Matter in Our\nAudit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of relevant internal controls over the\nCorporation’s goodwill impai",

As explained in Note 12 of the consolidated financial statements, the Corporation remeasures\nthe qualified defined benefit pension assets and obligations at the end of each year or more frequently upon the occurrence of\ncertain events. The amounts are measured using actuarial valuations, which depend on key assumptions such as the discount rate,\nthe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, and participant longevity.\nAuditing the defined benefit pension obligation was complex and required the involvement of specialists as a result of the\njudgmental nature of the actuarial assumptions such as discount rate, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, and\nparticipant longevity, used in the measurement process. These assumptions have a significant effect on the projected benefit\nobligation, with the discount rate being the most sensitive of those assumptions.\nHow We Addressed\nthe Matter in Our\nAudit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of relevant internal controls over\nmanagement’s measurement and valuation of the defined benefit pension obligation calculations. For example, we tested the\ninternal controls over management’s review of the defined benefit pension obligation calculations, the significant actuarial\nassumptions and the data inputs provided to the actuaries.\nTo test the defined benefit pension obligation, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the methodology used,\nthe significant actuarial assumptions described above and the underlying data used by the Co",

We also provide a broad range of management, engineering, technical, scientific,\nlogistics, system integration and cybersecurity services. We serve both U.S. and international customers with products and services that have defense, civil\nand commercial applications, with our principal customers being agencies of the U.S. Government.\nBasis of presentation – Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of subsidiaries we control and variable interest entities if we are\nthe primary beneficiary. We eliminate intercompany balances and transactions in consolidation. Our receivables, inventories, customer advances and\namounts in excess of costs incurred and certain amounts in other current liabilities primarily are attributable to long-term contracts or programs in progress\nfor which the related operating cycles are longer than one year. In accordance with industry practice, we include these items in current assets and current\nliabilities. Unless otherwise noted, we present all per share amounts cited in these consolidated financial statements on a “per diluted share” basis.\nUse of estimates – We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In\ndoing so, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying\nnotes. We base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the\nresults of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.\nOur actual results may differ materially from these estimates. Significant estimates inherent in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements\ninclude, but are not limited to, accounting for sales and cost recognition, postretirement benefit plans, assets for the portion of environmental costs that are\nprobable of future recovery and liabilities, evaluation of goodwill and other assets for impairment, income taxes including deferred income taxes, fair value\nmeasurements and contingencies.\nRevenue Recognition – The majority of our net sales are generated from long-term contracts with the U.S. Government and international customers\n(including foreign military sales (FMS) contracted through the U.S. Government) for the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and\nsustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services.

For\ncertain contracts that meet the foregoing requirements, primarily international direct commercial sale contracts, we are required to obtain certain regulatory\napprovals. In these cases, we recognize revenue when it is probable that we will receive regulatory approvals based upon all known facts and\ncircumstances. We provide our products and services under fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts.\nUnder fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform the specified work for a pre-determined price. To the extent our actual costs vary from the estimates\nupon which the price was negotiated, we will generate more or less profit or could incur a loss. Some fixed-price contracts have a performance-based\ncomponent under which we may earn incentive payments or incur financial penalties based on our performance.\nCost-reimbursable contracts provide for the payment of allowable costs incurred during performance of the contract plus a fee up to a ceiling based on\nthe amount that has been funded. Typically, we enter into three types of cost-reimbursable contracts: cost-plus-award-fee, cost-plus-incentive-fee, and cost-\nplus-fixed-fee. Cost-plus-award-fee contracts provide for an award fee that varies within specified limits based on the customer’s assessment of our\nperformance against a predetermined set of criteria, such as targets based on cost, quality, technical and schedule criteria. Cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts\nprovide for reimbursement of costs plus a fee, which is adjusted by a formula based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs (i.e.,\nincentive based on cost) or reimbursement of costs plus an incentive to exceed stated performance targets (i.e., incentive based on performance). The fixed-\nfee in a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract is negotiated at the inception of the contract and that fixed-fee does not vary with actual costs.\nWe assess each contract at its inception to determine whether it should be combined with other contracts. When making this determination, we\nconsider factors such as whether two or more contracts were negotiated and executed at or near the same time or were negotiated with an overall profit\nobjective. If combined, we treat the combined contracts as a single contract for revenue recognition purposes.\n72\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWe evaluate the products or services promised in each contract at inception to determine whether the contract should be accounted for as having one\nor more performance obligations. The products and services in our contracts are typically not distinct from one another due to their complex relationships\nand the significant contract management functions required to perform under the contract.

In limited cases, our contracts have more than one distinct performance obligation, which occurs when we perform activities that\nare not highly complex or interrelated or involve different product lifecycles. Significant judgment is required in determining performance obligations, and\nthese decisions could change the amount of revenue and profit recorded in a given period. We classify net sales as products or services on our consolidated\nstatements of earnings based on the predominant attributes of the performance obligations.\nWe determine the transaction price for each contract based on the consideration we expect to receive for the products or services being provided under\nthe contract. For contracts where a portion of the price may vary, we estimate variable consideration at the most likely amount, which is included in the\ntransaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. We analyze the risk of a significant\nrevenue reversal and if necessary constrain the amount of variable consideration recognized in order to mitigate this risk.\nAt the inception of a contract we estimate the transaction price based on our current rights and do not contemplate future modifications (including\nunexercised options) or follow-on contracts until they become legally enforceable. Contracts are often subsequently modified to include changes in\nspecifications, requirements or price, which may create new or change existing enforceable rights and obligations. Depending on the nature of the\nmodification, we consider whether to account for the modification as an adjustment to the existing contract or as a separate contract. Generally,\nmodifications to our contracts are not distinct from the existing contract due to the significant integration and interrelated tasks provided in the context of\nthe contract. Therefore, such modifications are accounted for as if they were part of the existing contract and recognized as a cumulative adjustment to\nrevenue.\nFor contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on the estimated\nstandalone selling price of the product or service underlying each performance obligation. The standalone selling price represents the amount we would sell\nthe product or service to a customer on a standalone basis (i.e., not bundled with any other products or services). Our contracts with the U.S. Government,\nincluding FMS contracts, are subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) and the price is typically based on estimated or actual costs plus a\nreasonable profit margin. As a result of these regulations, the standalone selling price of products or services in our contracts with the U.S. Government and\nFMS contracts are typically equal to the selling price stated in the contract.\nFor non-U.S. Government contracts with multiple performance obligations, we evaluate whet",

We primarily sell customized solutions unique to a customer’s specifications. When it is necessary to allocate the\ntransaction price to multiple performance obligations, we typically use the expected cost plus a reasonable profit margin to estimate the standalone selling\nprice of each product or service. We occasionally sell standard products or services with observable standalone sales transactions. In these situations, the\nobservable standalone sales transactions are used to determine the standalone selling price.\nWe recognize revenue as performance obligations are satisfied and the customer obtains control of the products and services. In determining when\nperformance obligations are satisfied, we consider factors such as contract terms, payment terms and whether there is an alternative future use of the\nproduct or service. Substantially all of our revenue is recognized over time as we perform under the contract because control of the work in process\ntransfers continuously to the customer. For most contracts with the U.S. Government and FMS contracts, this continuous transfer of control of the work in\nprocess to the customer is supported by clauses in the contract that give the customer ownership of work in process and allow the customer to unilaterally\nterminate the contract for convenience and pay us for costs incurred plus a reasonable profit. For most non-U.S. Government contracts, primarily\ninternational direct commercial contracts, continuous transfer of control to our customer is supported because we deliver products that do not have an\nalternative use to us and if our customer were to terminate the contract for reasons other than our non-performance we would have the right to recover\ndamages which would include, among other potential damages, the right to payment for our work performed to date plus a reasonable profit.\nFor performance obligations to deliver products with continuous transfer of control to the customer, revenue is recognized based on the extent of\nprogress towards completion of the performance obligation, generally using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress for our\ncontracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer as we incur costs on our contracts. Under the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost\nmeasure of progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs to\ncomplete the performance obligation(s). For performance obligations to provide services to the customer, revenue is recognized over time based on costs\nincurred or the right to invoice method (in situations where the value transferred matches our billing rights) as our customer receives and consumes the\nbenefits.\n73\n\n\nTable of Contents\nFor performance obligations in which control does not continuously transfer to",

This coincides with the point in time the customer obtains control of the product or service, which typically occurs\nupon customer acceptance or receipt of the product or service, given that we maintain control of the product or service until that point.\nBacklog (i.e., unfulfilled or remaining performance obligations) represents the sales we expect to recognize for our products and services for which\ncontrol has not yet transferred to the customer. It is converted into sales in future periods as work is performed or deliveries are made. For our cost-\nreimbursable and fixed-priced-incentive contracts, the estimated consideration we expect to receive pursuant to the terms of the contract may exceed the\ncontractual award amount. The estimated consideration is determined at the outset of the contract and is continuously reviewed throughout the contract\nperiod. In determining the estimated consideration, we consider the risks related to the technical, schedule and cost impacts to complete the contract and an\nestimate of any variable consideration. Periodically, we review these risks and may increase or decrease backlog accordingly. As the risks on such contracts\nare successfully retired, the estimated consideration from customers may be reduced, resulting in a reduction of backlog without a corresponding\nrecognition of sales. As of December 31, 2020, our ending backlog was $147.1 billion. We expect to recognize approximately 39% of our backlog over the\nnext 12 months and approximately 61% over the next 24 months as revenue, with the remainder recognized thereafter.\nFor arrangements with the U.S. Government and FMS contracts, we generally do not begin work on contracts until funding is appropriated by the\ncustomer. Billing timetables and payment terms on our contracts vary based on a number of factors, including the contract type. Typical payment terms\nunder fixed-price contracts with the U.S. Government provide that the customer pays either performance-based payments (PBPs) based on the achievement\nof contract milestones or progress payments based on a percentage of costs we incur. For the majority of our international direct commercial contracts to\ndeliver complex systems, we typically receive advance payments prior to commencement of work, as well as milestone payments that are paid in\naccordance with the terms of our contract as we perform. We recognize a liability for payments in excess of revenue recognized, which is presented as a\ncontract liability on the balance sheet. The portion of payments retained by the customer until final contract settlement is not considered a significant\nfinancing component because the intent is to protect the customer from our failure to adequately complete some or all of the obligations under the contract.\nPayments received from customers in advance of revenue recognition are not cons",

Amounts\nbilled and due from our customers under both contract types are classified as receivables on the balance sheet.\nSignificant estimates and assumptions are made in estimating contract sales and costs, including the profit booking rate. At the outset of a long-term\ncontract, we identify and monitor risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract, as well as variable consideration, and\nassess the effects of those risks on our estimates of sales and total costs to complete the contract. The estimates consider the technical requirements (e.g., a\nnewly-developed product versus a mature product), the schedule and associated tasks (e.g., the number and type of milestone events) and costs (e.g.,\nmaterial, labor, subcontractor, overhead, general and administrative and the estimated costs to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes\nreferred to as offset or localization agreements, required under certain contracts with international customers). The initial profit booking rate of each\ncontract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements, schedule and costs in the initial estimated total costs to complete the\ncontract. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the technical, schedule and\ncost aspects of the contract, which decreases the estimated total costs to complete the contract or may increase the variable consideration we expect to\nreceive on the contract. Conversely, our profit booking rates may decrease if the estimated total costs to complete the contract increase or our estimates of\nvariable consideration we expect to receive decrease. All of the estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect the\nprofit booking rate. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of the transaction price, a provision for the entire loss\nis determined at the contract level and is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined.\nComparability of our segment sales, operating profit and operating margin may be impacted favorably or unfavorably by changes in profit booking\nrates on our contracts for which we recognize revenue over time using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method to measure progress towards\ncompletion.

Company-funded R&D costs are allocated to customer contracts as part of the general\nand administrative overhead costs and generally recoverable on our customer contracts with the U.S. Government. Customer-funded R&D costs are\ncharged directly to the related customer contract. Substantially all R&D costs are charged to cost of sales as incurred. Company-funded R&D costs charged\nto cost of sales totaled $1.3 billion in each of 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nStock-based compensation – Compensation cost related to all share-based payments is measured at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of\nthe award. We generally recognize the compensation cost ratably over a three-year vesting period, net of estimated forfeitures. At each reporting date, the\nnumber of shares is adjusted to the number ultimately expected to vest.\nIncome taxes – We calculate our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are\nrecognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences that exist between the financial statement carrying amount of assets\nand liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as from operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities\nusing enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to be recovered or paid.\nWe periodically assess our tax exposures related to periods that are open to examination.

The amounts are stated at their net estimated realizable value. There were no significant impairment losses related to our receivables in 2020,\n2019 or 2018.\nContract assets – Contract assets include unbilled amounts typically resulting from sales under contracts when the percentage-of-completion cost-to-\ncost method of revenue recognition is utilized and revenue recognized exceeds the amount billed to the customer. The amounts may not exceed their\nestimated net realizable value. Contract assets are classified as current based on our contract operating cycle.\nInventories – We record inventories at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value. If events or changes in circumstances indicate that the utility\nof our inventories have diminished through damage, deterioration, obsolescence, changes in price or other causes, a loss is recognized in the period in\nwhich it occurs. We capitalize labor, material, subcontractor and overhead costs as work-in-process for contracts where control has not yet passed to the\ncustomer. In addition, we capitalize costs incurred to fulfill a contract in advance of contract award in inventories as work-in-process if we determine that\ncontract award is probable. We determine the costs of other product and supply inventories by using the first-in first-out or average cost methods.\nContract liabilities – Contract liabilities include advance payments and billings in excess of revenue recognized. Contract liabilities are classified as\ncurrent based on our contract operating cycle and reported on a contract-by-contract basis, net of revenue recognized, at the end of each reporting period.\nProperty, plant and equipment – We record property, plant and equipment at cost. We provide for depreciation and amortization on plant and\nequipment generally using accelerated methods during the first half of the estimated useful lives of the assets and the straight-line method thereafter. The\nestimated useful lives of our plant and equipment generally range from 10 to 40 years for buildings and five to 15 years for machinery and equipment.

Goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of\nacquired businesses. Intangible assets from acquired businesses are recognized at fair value on the acquisition date and consist of customer programs,\ntrademarks, customer relationships, technology and other intangible assets.

For selected reporting units where we\nuse the qualitative approach, we perform a qualitative evaluation of events and circumstances impacting the reporting unit to determine the likelihood of\ngoodwill impairment. Based on that qualitative evaluation, if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its\ncarrying amount, no further evaluation is necessary. Otherwise we perform a quantitative impairment test. We perform quantitative tests for most reporting\nunits at least once every three years. However, for certain reporting units we may perform a quantitative impairment test every year.\nFor the quantitative impairment test we compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of a\nreporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. If the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill,\nexceeds its fair value, a goodwill impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. We generally estimate the fair value of each reporting\nunit using a combination of a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis and market-based valuation methodologies such as comparable public company trading\nvalues and values observed in recent business acquisitions. Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgments, including the amount and\ntiming of expected future cash flows, long-term growth rates, discount rates and relevant comparable public company earnings multiples and relevant\ntransaction multiples. The cash flows employed in the DCF analysis are based on our best estimate of future sales, earnings and cash flows after\nconsidering factors such as general market conditions, U.S. Government budgets, existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers,\nlabor agreements, changes in working capital, long term business plans and recent operating performance. The discount rates utilized in the DCF analysis\nare based on the respective reporting unit’s weighted average cost of capital, which takes into account the relative weights of each component of capital\nstructure (equity and debt) and represents the expected cost of new capital, adjusted as appropriate to consider the risk inherent in future cash flows of the\nrespective reporting unit.

GAAP requires that the amounts we record related to our postretirement\nbenefit plans be computed, based on service to date, using actuarial valuations that are based in part on certain key economic assumptions we make,\nincluding the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and other actuarial assumptions including participant longevity (also known\nas mortality), health care cost trend rates and employee turnover, each as appropriate based on the nature of the plans.\nA market-related value of our plan assets, determined using actual asset gains or losses over the prior three year period, is used to calculate the amount\nof deferred asset gains or losses to be amortized. These asset gains or losses, along with those resulting from adjustments to our benefit obligation, will be\namortized to expense using the corridor method, where gains and losses are recognized over a period of years to the extent they exceed 10% of the greater\nof plan assets or benefit obligations. This amortization period extended in 2020 due to the freeze of our salaried pension plans to use the average remaining\nlife expectancy of the participants instead of average future service.\nWe recognize on a plan-by-plan basis the funded status of our postretirement benefit plans under GAAP as either an asset recorded within other\nnoncurrent assets or a liability recorded within noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. The GAAP funded status is measured as the\ndifference between the fair value of the plan’s assets and the benefit obligation of the plan.

Specifically, we consider whether we can\ncontrol the underlying asset and have the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits or outputs from the asset. Substantially all of our leases\nare long-term operating leases with fixed payment terms. We do not have significant financing leases. Our right-of-use (ROU) operating lease assets\nrepresent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and our operating lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments. ROU\noperating lease assets are recorded in other noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease liabilities are recorded in other current\nliabilities or other noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet based on their contractual due dates.\nBoth the ROU operating lease asset and liability are recognized as of the lease commencement date at the present value of the lease payments over the\nlease term. Most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate that can readily be determined. Therefore, we use a discount rate based on our incremental\nborrowing rate, which is determined using our credit rating and information available as of the commencement date. ROU operating lease assets include\nlease payments made at or before the lease commencement date, net of any lease incentives.\nOur operating lease agreements may include options to extend the lease term or terminate it early. We include options to extend or terminate leases in\nthe ROU operating lease asset and liability when it is reasonably certain we will exercise these\n87\n\n\nTable of Contents\noptions. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is included in cost of sales on our consolidated statement of\nearnings.\nWe have operating lease arrangements with lease and non-lease components. The non-lease components in our arrangements are not significant when\ncompared to the lease components. For all operating leases, we account for the lease and non-lease components as a single component. Additionally, for\ncertain equipment leases, we apply a portfolio approach to recognize operating lease ROU assets and liabilities. We evaluate ROU assets for impairment\nconsistent with our property, plant and equipment policy (see Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies).\nWe generally enter into operating lease agreements for facilities, land and equipment. Our ROU operating lease assets were $1.0 billion at\nDecember 31, 2020. Operating lease liabilities were $1.1 billion, of which $841 million were classified as noncurrent, at December 31, 2020",

Accordingly, unless otherwise indicated below in our discussion of\nlegal proceedings, a reasonably possible loss or range of loss associated with any individual legal proceeding cannot be estimated.\nLegal Proceedings\nAs a result of our acquisition of Sikorsky, we assumed the defense of and any potential liability for two civil False Claims Act lawsuits pending in the\nU.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. In October 2014, the U.S. Government filed a complaint in intervention in the first suit, which\nwas brought by qui tam relator Mary Patzer, a former Derco Aerospace (Derco) employee. In May 2017, the U.S. Government filed a complaint in\nintervention in the second suit, which was brought by qui tam relator Peter Cimma, a former Sikorsky Support Services, Inc. (SSSI) employee. In\nNovember 2017, the Court consolidated the cases into a single action for discovery and trial.\nThe U.S. Government alleges that Sikorsky and two of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Derco and SSSI, violated the civil False Claims Act and the\nTruth in Negotiations Act in connection with a contract the U.S. Navy awarded to SSSI in June 2006 to support the Navy’s T-34 and T-44 fixed-wing\nturboprop training aircraft. SSSI subcontracted with Derco, primarily to procure and manage spare parts for the training aircraft. The U.S. Government\ncontends that SSSI overbilled the Navy on the contract as the result of Derco’s use of prohibited cost-plus-percentage-of-cost pricing to add profit and\noverhead costs as a percentage of the price of the spare parts that Derco procured and then sold to SSSI. The U.S. Government also alleges that Derco’s\nclaims to SSSI, SSSI’s claims to the Navy, and SSSI’s yearly Certificates of Final Indirect Costs from 2006 through 2012 were false and that SSSI\nsubmitted inaccurate cost or pricing data in violation of the Truth in Negotiations Act for a sole-sourced, follow-on “bridge” contract. The U.S.\nGovernment’s complaints assert common law claims for breach of contract and unjust enrichment.\nThe U.S. Government further alleged violations of the Anti-Kickback Act and False Claims Act based on a monthly “chargeback,” through which\nSSSI billed Derco for the cost of certain SSSI personnel, allegedly in exchange for SSSI’s permitting a pricing arrangement that was “highly favorable” to\nDerco. On January 12, 2018, the Corporation filed a partial motion to dismiss intended to narrow the U.S. Government’s claims, including by seeking\ndismissal of the Anti-Kickback Act alle",

The District Court granted these motions, in part, on July 20, 2018, dismissing the Government’s\nclaims under the Anti-Kickback Act and dismissing Cimma as a party to the litigation.\nThe U.S. Government seeks damages of approximately $52 million, subject to trebling, plus statutory penalties. We believe that we have legal and\nfactual defenses to the U.S. Government’s remaining claims. Although we continue to evaluate our liability and exposure, we do not currently believe that\nit is probable that we will incur a material loss.

(LMSI) and a current Lockheed Martin vice president. The dollar amount of damages sought is not specified but DOJ seeks\ntreble damages with respect to the False Claims Act and penalties that are subject to doubling under the Anti-Kickback Act. The allegations relate primarily\nto information technology services performed by LMSI under a subcontract to MSA and the pricing by MSA and LMSI of those services as well as\nLockheed Martin’s payment of standard incentive compensation to certain employees who were seconded to MSA, including the vice president. MSA is a\njoint venture that holds a prime contract to provide infrastructure support services at DOE’s Hanford facility.

The MTA filed an answer and counterclaim alleging that we breached the contract and subsequently terminated the contract for\nalleged default. The primary damages sought by the MTA are the costs to complete the contract and potential re-procurement costs. While we are unable to\nestimate the cost of another contractor to complete the contract and the costs of re-procurement, we note that our contract with the MTA had a total value of\n$323 million, of which $241 million was paid to us, and that the MTA is seeking damages of approximately $190 million. We dispute the MTA’s\nallegations and are defending against them. Additionally, following an investigation, our sureties on a performance bond related to this matter, who were\nrepresented by independent counsel, concluded that the MTA’s termination of the contract was improper. Finally, our declaratory judgment action was later\namended to include claims for monetary damages against the MTA of approximately $95 million. This matter was taken under submission by the District\nCourt in December 2014, after a five-week bench trial and the filing of post-trial pleadings by the parties.

The fair values of mutual funds and certain\nother securities are determined by reference to the quoted market price per unit in active markets multiplied by the number of units held without\nconsideration of transaction costs. The fair values of U.S. Government and other securities are determined using pricing models that use observable inputs\n(e.g., interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals), bids provided by brokers or dealers or quoted prices of securities with\nsimilar characteristics. The fair values of derivative instruments, which consist of foreign currency forward contracts, including embedded derivatives, and\ninterest rate swap contracts, are primarily determined based on the present value of future cash flows using model-derived valuations that use observable\ninputs such as interest rates, credit spreads and foreign currency exchange rates.\nIn addition to the financial instruments listed in the table above, we hold other financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, receivables,\naccounts payable and debt and commercial paper. The carrying amounts for cash and cash equivalents, receivables and accounts payable approximated\ntheir fair values. The estimated fair value of our outstanding debt was $16.9 billion and $15.9 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019. The outstanding\nprincipal amount was $13.3 billion and $13.8 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, excluding $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion of unamortized discounts and\nissuance costs at December 31, 2020 and 2019.

A company’s\ninternal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded\nas necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures\nof the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance\nregarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the\nfinancial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any\nevaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree\nof compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nTysons, Virginia\nJanuary 28, 2021\n108\n\n\nTable of Contents\nITEM 9B.

In 2020, 74% of our $65.4 billion in net sales were from the U.S.\nGovernment, either as a prime contractor or as a subcontractor (including 64% from the Department of Defense (DoD)), 25% were from international\ncustomers (including foreign military sales (FMS) contracted through the U.S. Government) and 1% were from U.S. commercial and other customers. Our\nmain areas of focus are in defense, space, intelligence, homeland security and information technology, including cybersecurity.\nWe operate in an environment characterized by both complexity in global security and continuing economic pressures in the U.S. and globally. A\nsignificant component of our strategy in this environment is to focus on program execution, improving the quality and predictability of the delivery of our\nproducts and services, and placing security capability quickly into the hands of our U.S. and international customers at affordable prices. Recognizing that\nour customers are resource constrained, we are endeavoring to develop and extend our portfolio domestically in a disciplined manner with a focus on\nadjacent markets close to our core capabilities, as well as growing our international sales. We continue to focus on affordability initiatives. We also expect\nto continue to innovate and invest in technologies to fulfill new mission requirements for our customers, including through acquisitions, and invest in our\npeople so that we have the technical skills necessary to succeed.\nWe operate in four business segments: Aeronautics, Missiles and Fire Control (MFC), Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) and Space. We organize our\nbusiness segments based on the nature of the products and services offered.\nStrategic Action\nOn December 20, 2020, we entered into an agreement to acquire Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, Inc.

Changes within the industry we operate in, such\nas vertical integration by our peers, could negatively impact us. We often form teams with our competitors in efforts to provide our customers with the best\nmix of capabilities to address specific requirements. In some areas of our business, customer requirements are changing to encourage expanded\ncompetition. Principal factors of competition include the value of our products and services to the customer; technical and management capability; the\nability to develop and implement complex, integrated system architectures; total cost of ownership; our demonstrated ability to execute and perform against\ncontract requirements; and our ability to provide timely and cost effective solutions. Technological advances in such areas as additive manufacturing, data\nanalytics, digital engineering, artificial intelligence, advanced materials, autonomy and robotics, and new business models such as commercial access to\nspace are enabling new factors of competition for both traditional and non-traditional competitors.\nThe competition for international sales is generally subject to U.S. Government stipulations (e.g., export restrictions, market access, technology\ntransfer, industrial cooperation and contracting practices). We may compete against U.S. and non-U.S. companies (or teams) for contract awards by\ninternational governments. International competitions also may be subject to different laws or contracting practices of international governments that may\naffect how we structure our bid for the procurement. In many international procurements, the purchasing government’s relationship with the U.S. and its\nindustrial cooperation programs are important factors in determining the outcome of a competition. It is common for international customers to require\ncontractors to comply with their industrial cooperation regulations, sometimes referred to as offset requirements, and we have entered into foreign offset\nagreements as part of securing some international business.

As part of this program, we track employee health and\nsafety measures, including quarterly and yearly targets related to the number of injury and illness incidents that occur, those incidents that result in days\nlost, and the number of days lost due to workplace injuries. During 2020, these metrics were negatively impacted by the absence from work and delays in\nthe return to work related to the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to COVID-19, we took action to protect our employees’ safety and health, including by\nequipping employees with personal protective equipment, establishing minimum staffing and social distancing policies, sanitizing workspaces more\nfrequently, adopting alternate work schedules and instituting other measures aimed at minimizing the transmission of COVID-19 while sustaining\nproduction and related services. In addition, we have implemented a flexible teleworking policy for employees who can meet our customer commitments\nremotely, and a significant portion of our workforce began teleworking in mid-March 2020 and were continuing to telework as of December 31, 2020.

We expect to continue to derive most of our\nsales from work performed under U.S. Government contracts. Those contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of Congressional\nappropriations. Congress usually appropriates funds on a fiscal year (FY) basis even though contract performance may extend over many years.\nConsequently, contracts are often partially funded initially and additional funds are committed only as Congress makes further appropriations. If we incur\ncosts in excess of funds obligated on a contract, we may be at risk for reimbursement of those costs unless and until additional funds are obligated to the\ncontract.\nThe F-35 program, which consists of multiple development, production and sustainment contracts, is our largest program. It represented 28% of our\ntotal net sales in 2020. A decision by the U.S. Government or other governments to cut spending on this program or reduce or delay planned orders would\nhave an adverse impact on our business and results of operations. Given the size and complexity of the F-35 program, we anticipate that there will be\ncontinual reviews related to aircraft performance, program schedule, cost, and requirements as part of the DoD, Congressional, and international partners’\noversight and budgeting processes. Current program challenges include, but are not limited to, supplier and partner performance (including COVID-19\nrelated challenges), software development, the availability and receipt of funding for contracts on a timely basis, execution of future flight tests and\nfindings resulting from testing and operating the aircraft, the level of cost associated with life-cycle operations and sustainment and warranties, continuing\nto reduce the unit production costs, and achieving cost targets.\nBudget uncertainty, the risk of future budget cuts, the potential for U.S. government shutdowns, the use of continuing resolutions, and the federal debt\nceiling can adversely affect our industry and the funding for our programs.

As funds are typically appropriated on a fiscal year basis, and because the costs of a termination for convenience may exceed the\ncosts of continuing a program in a given fiscal year, programs occasionally do not have sufficient funds appropriated to cover the termination costs if the\ngovernment were to terminate them for convenience. Under such circumstances, the U.S. Government could assert that it is not required to appropriate\nadditional funding.\nA termination arising out of our default may expose us to liability and have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and\norders. In addition, on those contracts for which we are teamed with others and are not the prime contractor, the U.S. Government could terminate a prime\ncontract under which we are a subcontractor, notwithstanding the fact that our performance and the quality of the products or services we delivered were\nconsistent with our contractual obligations as a subcontractor. In the case of termination for default, the U.S. Government could make claims to reduce the\ncontract value or recover its procurement costs and could assess other special penalties. Under such circumstances we may have rights and there may be\nremedial actions available to us under applicable laws and the FAR.\nAdditionally, our programs for the U.S. Government often operate for periods of time under Undefinitized Contract Actions (UCAs), which means that\nwe begin performing our obligations before the terms, specifications or price are finally agreed to between the parties. The U.S. Government has the ability\nto unilaterally definitize contracts, which, absent a successful appeal, obligates us to perform under terms and conditions imposed by the U.S. Government.\nThe U.S. Government has unilaterally definitized contracts with us in the past, most notably the F-35 LRIP 9 contract in 2016 and more recently two FMS\nF-16 upgrade proposals in 2020, and may do so in the future.

Our customers also may pursue non-traditional contract provisions or contract types in negotiation of contracts. The\nU.S. Government’s preference for fixed-price contracting has resulted in what we believe to be the inappropriate application of fixed-priced contracting\nmethods to development programs. By their nature, the technical challenges, costs and timing of development programs are difficult to estimate and the use\nof fixed-price instead of cost-reimbursable contracts for such programs increases the financial risk to the contractor. This increased risk may lead to losses\non fixed price development programs or may cause us not to bid on future fixed-price development programs, which could adversely affect our future\ngrowth prospects and financial performance. In addition, given the customer’s emphasis on cost, even if we effectively manage program life-cycle and\nsustainment costs and meet customer affordability targets, the customer may elect to recompete programs at the end of existing contracts, which may result\nin a lost business opportunity.

Nevertheless, due to the evolving nature of these security threats and the national security aspects of much of the\ndata we protect, the impact of any future incident cannot be predicted.\nIn addition to cyber threats, we experience threats to the security of our facilities and employees and threats from terrorist acts. We also typically work\ncooperatively with our customers, suppliers, subcontractors, joint venture partners and entities we acquire, whom are subject to similar threats, to seek to\nminimize the impact of cyber threats, other security threats or business disruptions.

The impact of these plans on our earnings may be volatile in that the amount of expense we record for our\npostretirement benefit plans may materially change from year to year because the calculations are sensitive to changes in several key economic\nassumptions including interest rates and rates of return on plan assets, other actuarial assumptions including participant longevity (also known as mortality)\nand employee turnover, as well as the timing of cash funding. Changes in these factors, including actual returns on plan assets, may also affect our plan\nfunding, cash flow and stockholders’ equity. In addition, the funding of our plans and recovery of costs on our contracts, as described below, may also be\nsubject to changes caused by legislative or regulatory actions.\nWith regard to cash flow, we make substantial cash contributions to our plans as required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974\n(ERISA), as amended by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA). We generally are able to recover these contributions related to our plans as allowable\ncosts on our U.S. Government contracts, including FMS. However, there is a lag between the time when we contribute cash to our plans under pension\nfunding rules and when we recover pension costs under U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS). We also may not be successful in our efforts\nto reduce the volatility of our outstanding pension obligations and to accelerate CAS recovery and recover associated costs from the U.S. Government.\nFor more information on how these factors could impact earnings, financial position, cash flow and stockholders’ equity, see “Critical Accounting\nPolicies - Postretirement Benefit Plans” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and “Note 12 –\nPostretirement Benefit Plans” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOur estimates and projections may prove to be inaccurate and certain of our assets may be at risk of future impairment.\nThe accounting for some of our most significant activities is based on judgments and estimates, which are complex and subject to many variables.

As described in Item 1A, Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K,\nwe rely on other companies and the U.S. Government to provide materials, major components and products, and to perform a portion of the services that\nare provided to our customers under the terms of most of our contracts. Many of these suppliers also supply parts for commercial aviation businesses which\nhave been more significantly impacted by the pandemic due to the impacts on these markets. Global supply chain disruption caused by the response to\nCOVID-19 has impacted some of our programs and could impact our ability to perform on our contracts, in particular in instances where there is not a\nqualified second source of supply. We have identified a number of suppliers that have experienced delivery impacts due to COVID-19 and have been\nworking to manage those impacts. However, if alternatives or other mitigations are not effective, deliveries and other milestones on affected programs\ncould be adversely impacted.\nOur work in production facilities and labs has continued throughout the pandemic, consistent with guidance from federal, state and local officials to\nminimize the spread of COVID-19. We have taken actions to equip employees with personal protective equipment, establish minimum staffing and social\ndistancing policies, sanitize workspaces more frequently, adopt alternate work schedules and institute other measures aimed to sustain production and\nrelated services while minimizing the transmission of COVID-19. In addition, we have implemented a flexible teleworking policy for employees who can\nmeet our customer commitments remotely, and a significant portion of our workforce is currently teleworking.

The outlook for 2021 assumes continued support and funding of our programs, known impacts of COVID-19, and a statutory tax\nrate of 21%. Additionally, it assumes that there will not be significant reductions in customer budgets, changes in funding priorities and that the U.S.\nGovernment will not operate under a continuing resolution for an extended period in which new contract and program starts are restricted. Changes in\ncircumstances may require us to revise our assumptions, which could materially change our current estimate of 2021 net sales, operating margin and cash\nflows.\nWe expect a total net FAS/CAS pension benefit of approximately $2.3 billion in 2021 based on a 2.50% discount rate (a 75 basis point decrease from\nthe end of 2019), an approximate 16.5% return on plan assets in 2020, and a 7.00% expected long-term rate of return on plan assets in future years, among\nother assumptions. We expect to make contributions of approximately $1.0 billion to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2021 and anticipate\nrecovering approximately $2.1 billion of CAS pension cost.\nPortfolio Shaping Activities\nWe continuously strive to strengthen our portfolio of products and services to meet the current and future needs of our customers. We accomplish this\nin part by our independent research and development activities and through acquisition, divestiture and internal realignment activities.\nWe selectively pursue the acquisition of businesses and investments at attractive valuations that will expand or complement our current portfolio and\nallow access to new customers or technologies.

The appropriations provide $741 billion in discretionary funding for national defense (includes DoD funding\nand defense-related spending in energy and water development, homeland security, and military construction appropriations), of which $671 billion is in\nbase funding and $69 billion is Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO)/emergency funding (OCO and emergency supplemental funding do not count\ntoward discretionary spending caps). Of the $741 billion, the DoD was allocated $704 billion, composed of $635 billion in base funding and $69 billion in\nOCO and emergency funding. The appropriations adhere to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 (BBA 2019), which increased the spending limits for both\ndefense and non-defense discretionary funds for the final two years (FY 2020 and FY 2021) of the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA).\nThe Appropriations Act also provides stimulus funds to individuals, businesses, and hospitals in response to the economic distress caused by the\ncoronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Additionally, it extends Section 3610 of the CARES Act until March 31, 2021, which gives DoD and federal agencies\ndiscretion to reimburse contractors for any paid leave, including sick leave, a contractor provides during the pandemic to keep its employees in a ready\nstate.\nInternational",

To accomplish this growth, we continue to focus on strengthening our\nrelationships internationally through partnerships and joint technology efforts. We conduct business with international customers through each of our\nbusiness segments through either FMS or direct sales to international customers. See Item 1A - Risk Factors for a discussion of risks related to international\nsales.\nInternational customers accounted for 31% of Aeronautics’ 2020 net sales. There continues to be strong international interest in the F-35 program,\nwhich includes commitments from the U.S. Government and seven international partner countries and six international customers, as well as expressions of\ninterest from other countries. The U.S. Government and the partner countries continue to work together on the design, testing, production, and sustainment\nof the F-35 program. Other areas of international expansion at our Aeronautics business segment include the F-16 and C-130J programs. Aeronautics\nreceived contracts in 2020 with Bulgaria and Taiwan for new F-16 aircraft, extending work beyond 2025. The C-130J Super Hercules aircraft continued to\ndraw interest from various international customers, including a contract in 2020 from New Zealand.\nIn 2020, international customers accounted for 25% of MFC’s net sales. Our MFC business segment continues to generate significant international\ninterest, most notably in the air and missile defense product line, which produces the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) and Terminal High Altitude\nArea Defense (THAAD) systems. The PAC-3 family of missiles are the only combat proven Hit-to-Kill interceptors that defend against incoming threats,\nincluding tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and aircraft. Fourteen nations have chosen PAC-3 Cost Reduction Initiative (CRI) and PAC-3 Missile\nSegment Enhancement (MSE) to provide missile defense capabilities. THAAD is an integrated system designed to protect against high altitude ballistic\nmissile threats. Additionally, we continue to see international demand for our tactical missile and fire control products, where we received orders for\nprecision fires systems from Poland and Romania; and Apache and Low Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infrared for Night (LANTIRN ) systems for\nQatar.\nIn 2020, international customers accounted for 25% of RMS’ net sales.

Production of the aircraft is\nexpected to continue for many years given the U.S. Government’s current inventory objective of 2,456 aircraft for the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Marine Corps,\nand U.S. Navy; commitments from our seven international partner countries and six international customers; as well as expressions of interest from other\ncountries.\nDuring 2020, the F-35 program completed several milestones both domestically and internationally. The U.S. Government continued testing the\naircraft, including ship trials, mission and weapons systems evaluations, and the F-35 fleet recently surpassed 355,000 flight hours. During the second half\nof 2020, the U.S. Government awarded the production of 18 F-35 Block Buy aircraft in addition to the 448 aircraft previously awarded.

See the discussion\nin Business Overview - COVID-19 and Item 1A, Risk Factors.\nAs a result of Turkey accepting delivery of the Russian S-400 air and missile defense system, the U.S. Government removed Turkey from the F-35\nprogram in 2019 and in December 2020 imposed sanctions on Turkey’s defense procurement agency (SSB) and certain of the agency’s officers under the\nCountering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA). The primary sanction imposed was a restriction on all new U.S. export licenses and\nauthorizations for any goods or technology transferred to the SSB, but does not apply to current, valid export licenses and authorizations. Lockheed Martin\nexpects the U.S. Government to continue to engage Turkey on these issues, but we have no indication that the sanctions will be removed, that additional\nsanctions will not be imposed or that Turkey will not issue reciprocal sanctions. While we do not expect the current sanctions to have a material effect on\nour current programs, additional sanctions, reciprocal sanctions or other actions, could be material to our operations, operating results, financial position or\ncash flows.\nIn addition to having committed to purchase up to 100 F-35 aircraft, six of which had completed production at the time of removal, Turkish suppliers\ncontinue to produce component parts for the F-35 program, some of which are single-sourced. To minimize the risks of disruption of our supply chain and\nensure continuity of F-35 production, we have been working closely with the DoD and supporting activities to identify and engage alternate suppliers for\nthe component parts produced by Turkish suppliers. We have made significant progress transitioning to non-Turkish suppliers, but due to the procedure to\nqualify new parts and suppliers, this collaborative process between DoD and Lockheed Martin is ongoing. During 2020, the DoD publicly confirmed that\nTurkish suppliers would be permitted to provide certain components for the F-35 through 2022. While the transition timeline is an important first step, it is\nequally important that our replacement capacity is re-established so that production is not impacted. Efforts to date have significantly reduced our risk, but\nfinal resolution on a limited number of remaining components could affect F-35 deliveries, and any accelerated work stoppage would impact cost.

This approach is consistent throughout the life cycle of our contracts, as management assesses the bidding of each contract by focusing on net\nsales and operating profit and monitors performance on our contracts in a similar manner through their completion.\nWe regularly provide customers with reports of our costs as the contract progresses. The cost information in the reports is accumulated in a manner\nspecified by the requirements of each contract. For example, cost data provided to a customer for a product would typically align to the subcomponents of\nthat product (such as a wing-box on an aircraft) and for services would align to the type of work being performed (such as aircraft sustainment). Our\ncontracts generally allow for the recovery of costs in the pricing of our products and services. Most of our contracts are bid and negotiated with our\ncustomers under circumstances in which we are required to disclose our estimated total costs to provide the product or service. This approach for\nnegotiating contracts with our U.S. Government customers generally allows for recovery of our actual costs plus a reasonable profit margin. We also may\nenter into long-term supply contracts for certain materials or components to coincide with the production schedule of certain products and to ensure their\navailability at known unit prices.\nMany of our contracts span several years and include highly complex technical requirements. At the outset of a contract, we identify and monitor risks\nto the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract and assess the effects of those risks on our estimates of total costs to complete\nthe contract. The estimates consider the technical requirements (e.g., a newly-developed product versus a mature product), the schedule and associated\ntasks (e.g., the number and type of milestone events) and costs (e.g., material, labor, subcontractor, overhead and the estimated costs to fulfill our industrial\ncooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, required under certain contracts with international customers). The initial profit\nbooking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements, schedule and costs in the initial estimated total\ncosts to complete the contract. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the\ntechnical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract, which decreases the estimated total costs to complete the contract. Conversely, our profit booking rates\nmay decrease if the estimated total costs to complete the contract increase. All of the estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract\nand may affect the profit booking rate.\nWe have a number of programs that are designated as classified by the U.S. Government which cannot be specifically described.

Changes in volume refer to increases or decreases in sales or\noperating profit resulting from varying production activity levels, deliveries or service levels on individual contracts. Volume changes in segment operating\nprofit are typically based on the current profit booking rate for a particular contract.\nIn addition, comparability of our segment sales, operating profit and operating margin may be impacted favorably or unfavorably by changes in profit\nbooking rates on our contracts for which we recognize revenue over time using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method to measure progress\ntowards completion. Increases in the profit booking rates, typically referred to as risk retirements, usually relate to revisions in the estimated total costs to\nfulfill the performance obligations that reflect improved conditions on a particular contract. Conversely, conditions on a particular contract may deteriorate,\nresulting in an increase in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations and a reduction in the profit booking rate. Increases or decreases in\nprofit booking rates are recognized in the current period and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. Segment operating profit and margin may\nalso be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other items, which may or may not impact sales. Favorable items may include the positive resolution of\ncontractual matters, cost recoveries on severance and restructuring charges, insurance recoveries and gains on sales of assets. Unfavorable items may\ninclude the adverse resolution of contractual matters; restructuring charges, except for significant severance actions, which are excluded from segment\noperating results; reserves for disputes; certain asset impairments; and losses on sales of certain assets.\nAs previously disclosed, we are responsible for a prog",

These agreements also may be satisfied through our use of cash for such activities as\npurchasing supplies from in-country vendors, providing financial support for in-country projects, establishment of joint ventures with local companies and\nbuilding or leasing facilities for in-country operations. We typically do not commit to offset agreements until orders for our products or services are\ndefinitive.

Satisfaction of our offset obligations are included in the estimates of our total costs\nto complete the contract and may impact our sales, profitability and cash flows. Our ability to recover investments on our consolidated balance sheet that\nwe make to satisfy offset obligations is generally dependent upon the successful operation of ventures that we do not control and may involve products and\nservices that are dissimilar to our business activities.

Typically, we enter into three types of cost-reimbursable contracts: cost-plus-award-fee, cost-plus-incentive-fee, and cost-\nplus-fixed-fee. Cost-plus-award-fee contracts provide for an award fee that varies within specified limits based on the customer’s assessment of our\nperformance against a predetermined set of criteria, such as targets based on cost, quality, technical and schedule criteria. Cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts\nprovide for reimbursement of costs plus a fee, which is adjusted by a formula based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs (i.e.,\nincentive based on cost) or reimbursement of costs plus an incentive to exceed stated performance targets (i.e., incentive based on performance). The fixed-\nfee in a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract is negotiated at the inception of the contract and that fixed-fee does not vary with actual costs.\nWe assess each contract at its inception to determine whether it should be combined with other contracts. When making this determination, we\nconsider factors such as whether two or more contracts were negotiated and executed at or near the same\n(a)\n(a)\n54\n\n\nTable of Contents\ntime or were negotiated with an overall profit objective. If combined, we treat the combined contracts as a single contract for revenue recognition purposes.\nWe evaluate the products or services promised in each contract at inception to determine whether the contract should be accounted for as having one\nor more performance obligations. The products and services in our contracts are typically not distinct from one another due to their complex relationships\nand the significant contract management functions required to perform under the contract. Accordingly, our contracts are typically accounted for as one\nperformance obligation. In limited cases, our contracts have more than one distinct performance obligation, which occurs when we perform activities that\nare not highly complex or interrelated or involve different product lifecycles. Significant judgment is required in determining performance obligations, and\nthese decisions could change the amount of revenue and profit recorded in a given period.

We analyze the risk of a significant\nrevenue reversal and if necessary constrain the amount of variable consideration recognized in order to mitigate this risk.\nAt the inception of a contract we estimate the transaction price based on our current rights and do not contemplate future modifications (including\nunexercised options) or follow-on contracts until they become legally enforceable. Contracts are often subsequently modified to include changes in\nspecifications, requirements or price, which may create new or change existing enforceable rights and obligations. Depending on the nature of the\nmodification, we consider whether to account for the modification as an adjustment to the existing contract or as a separate contract. Generally,\nmodifications to our contracts are not distinct from the existing contract due to the significant integration and interrelated tasks provided in the context of\nthe contract. Therefore, such modifications are accounted for as if they were part of the existing contract and recognized as a cumulative adjustment to\nrevenue.\nFor contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on the estimated\nstandalone selling price of the product or service underlying each performance obligation. The standalone selling price represents the amount we would sell\nthe product or service to a customer on a standalone basis (i.e., not bundled with any other products or services). Our contracts with the U.S. Government,\nincluding FMS contracts, are subject to FAR and the price is typically based on estimated or actual costs plus a reasonable profit margin. As a result of\nthese regulations, the standalone selling price of products or services in our contracts with the U.S. Government and FMS contracts are typically equal to\nthe selling price stated in the contract.\nFor non-U.S. Government contracts with multiple performance obligations, we evaluate whether the stated selling prices for the products or services\nrepresent their standalone selling prices. We primarily sell customized solutions unique to a customer’s specifications. When it is necessary to allocate the\ntransaction price to multiple performance obligations, we typically use the expected cost plus a reasonable profit margin to estimate the standalone selling\nprice of each product or service.

In these situations, the\nobservable standalone sales transactions are used to determine the standalone selling price.\nWe recognize revenue as performance obligations are satisfied and the customer obtains control of the products and services.

For most non-U.S. Government contracts, primarily\ninternational direct commercial contracts, continuous transfer of control to our customer is supported because we deliver products that do not have an\nalternative use to us and if our customer were to terminate the contract for reasons other than our non-performance we would have the right to recover\ndamages which would include, among other potential damages, the right to payment for our work performed to date plus a reasonable profit.\nFor performance obligations to deliver products with continuous transfer of control to the customer, revenue is recognized based on the extent of\nprogress towards completion of the performance obligation, generally using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress for our\ncontracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer as we incur costs on our contracts.

The initial profit booking rate of each\ncontract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements, schedule and costs in the initial estimated total costs to complete the\ncontract. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the technical, schedule and\ncost aspects of the contract, which decreases the estimated total costs to complete the contract or may increase the variable consideration we expect to\nreceive on the contract.

Increases or decreases in profit\nbooking rates are recognized in the current period and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. Segment operating profit and margin may also be\nimpacted favorably or unfavorably by other items, which may or may not impact sales. Favorable items may include the positive resolution of contractual\nmatters, cost recoveries on severance and restructuring charges, insurance recoveries and gains on sales of assets. Unfavorable items may include the\nadverse resolution of contractual matters; restructuring charges, except for significant severance actions, which are excluded from segment operating\nresults; reserves for disputes; certain asset impairments; and losses on sales of certain assets.\nOther Contract Accounting Considerations\nThe majority of our sales are driven by pricing based on c",

During December 2020, Lockheed Martin, through its master\nretirement trust, purchased an irrevocable group annuity contract from an insurance company (referred to as a buy-out contract) for $1.4 billion to transfer\nthe related, outstanding defined benefit pension obligations. As a result of this transaction, we were relieved of all responsibility for these pension\nobligations and the insurance company is now required to pay and administer the retirement benefits owed to approximately 13,500 U.S. retirees and\nbeneficiaries, with no change to the amount, timing or form of monthly retirement benefit payments. Although the transaction was treated as a settlement\nfor accounting purposes, we did not recognize a loss on the settlement in earnings associated with the transaction because total settlements during 2020 for\nthe affected pension plans were less than the plans’ service and interest cost in 2020.\nA second contract was also purchased from an insurance company for $793 million that will reimburse the plan for all future benefit payments related\nto approximately 2,500 U.S. retirees and beneficiaries (referred to as a buy-in contract). The covered retirees and beneficiaries and buy-in contract were\nspun-off to the plan established in December 2018 for the contract purchased at that time similarly structured as a buy-in; the buy-in contracts are the sole\nassets of that plan. Under the arrangement, the plan remains responsible for paying the benefits for the covered retirees and beneficiaries and the insurance\ncompany will reimburse the plan as those benefits are paid. As a result, there is no net ongoing cash flow to the plan for the covered retirees and\nbeneficiaries as the cost of providing the benefits is funded by the buy-in contract; effectively locking in the cost of the benefits and eliminating future\nvolatility of the benefit obligation, while also providing the option to convert to a buy-out. The buy-in contract was purchased using assets from the pension\ntrust and is accounted for at fair value as an investment of the trust. These transactions had no impact on our 2020 FAS pension expense or CAS pension\ncost.\nSince December 2018, Lockheed Martin, through its master retirement trust, has purchased total contracts (both buy-in and buy-out) for approximately\n$6.7 billion related to our outstanding defined benefit pension obligations eliminating pension plan volatility for approximately 77,000 retirees and\nbeneficiaries and annually required Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation (PBGC) premiums of approximately $55 milli",

The amounts we record are measured using actuarial valuations, which are dependent upon key\nassumptions such as discount rates, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, participant longevity, employee turnover and the health care cost\ntrend rates for our retiree medical plans. The assumptions we make affect both the calculation of the benefit obligations as of the measurement date and the\ncalculation of net periodic benefit cost in subsequent periods. When reassessing these assumptions, we consider past and current market conditions and\nmake judgments about future market trends. We also consider factors such as the timing and amounts of expected contributions to the plans and benefit\npayments to plan participants.\nWe continue to use a single weighted average discount rate approach when calculating our consolidated benefit obligations related to our defined\nbenefit pension plans resulting in 2.50% at December 31, 2020, compared to 3.25% at December 31, 2019. We utilized a single weighted average discount\nrate of 2.375% when calculating our benefit obligations related to our retiree medical and life insurance plans at December 31, 2020, compared to 3.25% at\nDecember 31, 2019. We evaluate several data points in order to arrive at an appropriate single weighted average discount rate, including results from cash\nflow models, quoted rates from long-term bond indices and changes in long-term bond rates over the past year. As part of our evaluation, we calculate the\napproximate average yields on corporate bonds rated AA or better selected to match our projected postretirement benefit plan cash flows. The decrease in\nthe discount rate from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020 resulted in an increase in the projected benefit obligations of our qualified defined benefit\npension plans of approximately $4.9 billion at December 31, 2020.\nWe utilized an expected l",

The long-term rate of\nreturn assumption represents the expected long-term rate of return on the funds invested or to be invested, to provide for the benefits included in the benefit\nobligations. This assumption is based on several factors including historical market index returns, the anticipated long-term allocation of plan assets, the\nhistorical return data for the trust funds, plan expenses and the potential to outperform market index returns. The difference between the long-term rate of\nreturn on plan assets assumption we select and the actual return on plan assets in any given year affects both the funded status of our benefit plans and the\ncalculation of FAS pension expense in subsequent periods. Although the actual return in any specific year likely will differ from the assumption, the\naverage expected return over a long-term future horizon should be approximately equal to the assumption. Any variance each year should not, by itself,\nsuggest that the assumption should be changed. Patterns of variances are reviewed over time, and then combined with expectations for the future. As a\nresult, changes in this assumption are less frequent than changes in the discount rate. The actual investment return for our qualified defined benefit plans\nduring 2020 of $5.6 billion based on an actual rate of approximately 16.5% improved plan assets more than the $2.3 billion expected return based on our\n7.00% long-term rate of return assumption.\nIn October 2020, the Society of Actuaries published revised longevity assumptions that refined its prior studies.

For selected reporting units where we use the\nqualitative approach, we perform a qualitative evaluation of events and circumstances impacting the reporting unit to determine the likelihood of goodwill\nimpairment. Based on that qualitative evaluation, if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying\namount, no further evaluation is necessary. Otherwise we perform a quantitative impairment test. We perform quantitative tests for most reporting units at\nleast once every three years. However, for certain reporting units we may perform a quantitative impairment test every year.\nTo perform the quantitative impairment test, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of a\nreporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. If the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill,\nexceeds its fair value, a goodwill impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.

As of the date of our annual impairment test, the fair value of our Sikorsky reporting unit exceeded\nits carrying value, which included goodwill of $2.7 billion, by a margin of approximately 30%. The fair value of our Sikorsky reporting unit can be\nsignificantly impacted by changes in expected future orders, general market pressures, including U.S. Government budgetary constraints, discount rates,\nlong term growth rates, and changes in U.S. (federal or state) or foreign tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, including those\nwith retroactive effect, along with other significant judgments.

Due to the\nmany variables inherent in the estimation of a reporting unit’s fair value and the relative size of our recorded goodwill, differences in assumptions could\nhave a material effect on the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period.\nAcquired intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to annual impairment testing. This testing compares\ncarrying value to fair value and, when appropriate, the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we performed\nour annual impairment test, and the results of that test indicated no impairment existed. Finite-lived intangibles are amortized to expense over the\napplicable useful lives, ranging from three to 20 years, based on the nature of the asset and the underlying pattern of economic benefit as reflected by future\nnet cash inflows. We perform an impairment test of finite-lived intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value may\nbe impaired. If events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of a finite-lived intangible may be impaired, the sum of the undiscounted\nfuture cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset group would be compared to the asset group’s carrying value. If the asset group’s carrying\namount exceed the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows, we would determine the fair value of the asset group and record an impairment loss in net\nearnings.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee “Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (under the caption “Recent Accounting\nPronouncements”).\n62\n\n\nTable of Contents\nITEM  7A.

We believe that they provide us with\nsufficient access to the general and trade credit we require to conduct our business. We continue to closely monitor the financial market environment and\nactively manage counterparty exposure to minimize the potential impact from adverse developments with any single credit provider while ensuring\navailability of, and access to, sufficient credit resources.\nOur main exposure to market risk relates to interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and market prices on certain equity securities. Our financial\ninstruments that are subject to interest rate risk principally include fixed-rate long-term debt and commercial paper, if issued. The estimated fair value of\nour outstanding debt was $16.9 billion at December 31, 2020 and the outstanding principal amount was $13.3 billion, excluding unamortized discounts and\nissuance costs of $1.1 billion. A 10% change in the level of interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of our outstanding debt at\nDecember 31, 2020.\nWe use derivative instruments principally to reduce our exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.\nWe do not enter into or hold derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes. We transact business globally and are subject to risks associated with\nchanging foreign currency exchange rates. We enter into foreign currency hedges such as forward and option contracts that change in value as foreign\ncurrency exchange rates change. Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the British pound sterling, the euro, the Canadian dollar and the\nAustralian dollar. These contracts hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions in order to mitigate fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows associated\nwith changes in foreign currency exchange rates. As a result, we do not have material foreign currency transaction exposure, including exposure to the\npound sterling or euro should there be material foreign currency fluctuations due to the United Kingdom departing from the European Union (commonly\nreferred to as Brexit). We designate foreign currency hedges as cash flow hedges. We also are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes primarily\nthrough our borrowing activities. For fixed rate borrowings, we may use variable interest rate swaps, effectively converting fixed rate borrowings to\nvariable rate borrowings in order to hedge changes in the fair value of the debt. These swaps are designated as fair value hedges. For variable rate\nborrowings, we may use fixed interest rate swaps, effectively converting variable rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings in order to mitigate the impact of\ninterest rate changes on earnings.

Adjustments to reflect changes in fair values of derivatives attributable to highly effective hedges are either reflected in earnings and\nlargely offset by corresponding adjustments to the hedged items or reflected net of income taxes in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged\ntransaction is recognized in earnings. Changes in the fair value of the derivatives that are not highly effective, if any, are immediately recognized in\nearnings. The aggregate notional amount of our outstanding interest rate swaps at December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $572 million and $750 million. The\naggregate notional amount of our outstanding foreign currency hedges at December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $3.4 billion and $3.8 billion. At December 31,\n2020 and 2019, the net fair value of our derivative instruments was not material (see “Note 17 – Fair Value Measurements” included in our Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements). A 10% unfavorable exchange rate movement of our foreign currency contracts would not have a material impact on\nthe aggregate net fair value of such contracts or our consolidated financial statements. Additionally, as we enter into foreign currency contracts to hedge\nforeign currency exposure on underlying transactions we believe that any movement on our foreign currency contracts would be offset by movement on the\nunderlying transactions and, therefore, when taken together do not create material risk.\nWe evaluate the credit quality of potential counterparties to derivative transactions and only enter into agreements with those deemed to have\nacceptable credit risk at the time the agreements are executed. Our foreign currency exchange hedge portfolio is diversified across several banks. We\nperiodically monitor changes to counterparty credit quality as well as our concentration of credit exposure to individual counterparties.

As more fully described in Note 1 to\nthe consolidated financial statements, the Corporation generates the majority of its net sales from long-term contracts with its\ncustomers whereby substantially all of the Corporation’s revenue is recognized over time using the percentage-of-completion\ncost-to-cost measure of progress. Under the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress, the Corporation\nmeasures progress towards completion based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the estimated total costs to complete the\nperformance obligation(s) (referred to as the estimate-at-completion analysis). The Corporation estimates profit on these\ncontracts as the difference between total estimated revenues and total estimated cost at completion.\nThe percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions to\nestimate contract sales and costs associated with its contracts with customers. At the outset of a long-term contract, the\nCorporation identifies risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract. Throughout the\ncontract life cycle, the Corporation monitors and assesses the effects of those risks on its estimates of sales and total costs to\ncomplete the contract. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if the Corporation successfully\nretires risks surrounding the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract, which would decrease the estimated total costs\nto complete the contract. Conversely, the profit booking rates may decrease if the estimated total costs to complete the contract\nincrease. Changes to the profit booking rates resulting from changes in estimates could have a material effect on the\nCorporation’s results of operations.\nAuditing the Corporation’s estimate-at-completion analyses used in its revenue recognition process was complex ",

For example, we tested internal controls over management’s review of the estimate-\nat-completion analyses and the significant assumptions underlying the estimated contract value and estimated total costs to\ncomplete. We also tested internal controls that management executes to validate the data used in the estimate-at-completion\nanalyses was complete and accurate.\nTo test the accuracy of the Corporation’s estimate-at-completion analyses, our audit procedures included, among others,\ncomparing estimates of labor costs, subcontractor costs, and materials to historical results of similar contracts, and agreeing the\nkey terms to contract documentation and management’s estimates. We also performed sensitivity analyses over the significant\nassumptions to evaluate the change in the profit booking rates resulting from changes in the assumptions.\nGoodwill Impairment Assessment – Sikorsky Reporting Unit\nDescription of the\nMatter\nAt December 31, 2020, the Corporation’s Sikorsky reporting unit had a goodwill balance of $2.7 billion which represented\napproximately 5.2% of total assets. As discussed in Note 1 and Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, goodwill is tested\nfor impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level using either a qualitative or quantitative approach. Under the\nquantitative approach to test for goodwill impairment, the Corporation compares the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying\namount, including goodwill. Generally, the Corporation estimates the fair value of its reporting units using a combination of a\ndiscounted cash flows analysis and market-based valuation methodologies.\nAuditing management’s annual impairment test over the Sikorsky reporting unit goodwill was complex and highly judgmental\ndue to the significant estimation required in determining the fair value. In particular, the fair value estimate was sensitive to\nsignificant assumptions, such as revenue growth rates, operating margins, cash flows, terminal value, and weighted average cost\nof capital, which are affected by expectations about future market or economic conditions and expected future operating results\nof the Sikorsky business.\n65\n\n\nTable of Contents\nHow We Addressed\nthe Matter in Our\nAudit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of relevant internal controls over the\nCorporation’s goodwill impai",

As explained in Note 12 of the consolidated financial statements, the Corporation remeasures\nthe qualified defined benefit pension assets and obligations at the end of each year or more frequently upon the occurrence of\ncertain events. The amounts are measured using actuarial valuations, which depend on key assumptions such as the discount rate,\nthe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, and participant longevity.\nAuditing the defined benefit pension obligation was complex and required the involvement of specialists as a result of the\njudgmental nature of the actuarial assumptions such as discount rate, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, and\nparticipant longevity, used in the measurement process. These assumptions have a significant effect on the projected benefit\nobligation, with the discount rate being the most sensitive of those assumptions.\nHow We Addressed\nthe Matter in Our\nAudit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of relevant internal controls over\nmanagement’s measurement and valuation of the defined benefit pension obligation calculations. For example, we tested the\ninternal controls over management’s review of the defined benefit pension obligation calculations, the significant actuarial\nassumptions and the data inputs provided to the actuaries.\nTo test the defined benefit pension obligation, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the methodology used,\nthe significant actuarial assumptions described above and the underlying data used by the Co",

We also provide a broad range of management, engineering, technical, scientific,\nlogistics, system integration and cybersecurity services. We serve both U.S. and international customers with products and services that have defense, civil\nand commercial applications, with our principal customers being agencies of the U.S. Government.\nBasis of presentation – Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of subsidiaries we control and variable interest entities if we are\nthe primary beneficiary. We eliminate intercompany balances and transactions in consolidation. Our receivables, inventories, customer advances and\namounts in excess of costs incurred and certain amounts in other current liabilities primarily are attributable to long-term contracts or programs in progress\nfor which the related operating cycles are longer than one year. In accordance with industry practice, we include these items in current assets and current\nliabilities. Unless otherwise noted, we present all per share amounts cited in these consolidated financial statements on a “per diluted share” basis.\nUse of estimates – We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In\ndoing so, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying\nnotes. We base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the\nresults of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.\nOur actual results may differ materially from these estimates. Significant estimates inherent in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements\ninclude, but are not limited to, accounting for sales and cost recognition, postretirement benefit plans, assets for the portion of environmental costs that are\nprobable of future recovery and liabilities, evaluation of goodwill and other assets for impairment, income taxes including deferred income taxes, fair value\nmeasurements and contingencies.\nRevenue Recognition – The majority of our net sales are generated from long-term contracts with the U.S. Government and international customers\n(including foreign military sales (FMS) contracted through the U.S. Government) for the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and\nsustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services.

For\ncertain contracts that meet the foregoing requirements, primarily international direct commercial sale contracts, we are required to obtain certain regulatory\napprovals. In these cases, we recognize revenue when it is probable that we will receive regulatory approvals based upon all known facts and\ncircumstances. We provide our products and services under fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts.\nUnder fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform the specified work for a pre-determined price. To the extent our actual costs vary from the estimates\nupon which the price was negotiated, we will generate more or less profit or could incur a loss. Some fixed-price contracts have a performance-based\ncomponent under which we may earn incentive payments or incur financial penalties based on our performance.\nCost-reimbursable contracts provide for the payment of allowable costs incurred during performance of the contract plus a fee up to a ceiling based on\nthe amount that has been funded. Typically, we enter into three types of cost-reimbursable contracts: cost-plus-award-fee, cost-plus-incentive-fee, and cost-\nplus-fixed-fee. Cost-plus-award-fee contracts provide for an award fee that varies within specified limits based on the customer’s assessment of our\nperformance against a predetermined set of criteria, such as targets based on cost, quality, technical and schedule criteria. Cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts\nprovide for reimbursement of costs plus a fee, which is adjusted by a formula based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs (i.e.,\nincentive based on cost) or reimbursement of costs plus an incentive to exceed stated performance targets (i.e., incentive based on performance). The fixed-\nfee in a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract is negotiated at the inception of the contract and that fixed-fee does not vary with actual costs.\nWe assess each contract at its inception to determine whether it should be combined with other contracts. When making this determination, we\nconsider factors such as whether two or more contracts were negotiated and executed at or near the same time or were negotiated with an overall profit\nobjective. If combined, we treat the combined contracts as a single contract for revenue recognition purposes.\n72\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWe evaluate the products or services promised in each contract at inception to determine whether the contract should be accounted for as having one\nor more performance obligations. The products and services in our contracts are typically not distinct from one another due to their complex relationships\nand the significant contract management functions required to perform under the contract.

In limited cases, our contracts have more than one distinct performance obligation, which occurs when we perform activities that\nare not highly complex or interrelated or involve different product lifecycles. Significant judgment is required in determining performance obligations, and\nthese decisions could change the amount of revenue and profit recorded in a given period. We classify net sales as products or services on our consolidated\nstatements of earnings based on the predominant attributes of the performance obligations.\nWe determine the transaction price for each contract based on the consideration we expect to receive for the products or services being provided under\nthe contract. For contracts where a portion of the price may vary, we estimate variable consideration at the most likely amount, which is included in the\ntransaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. We analyze the risk of a significant\nrevenue reversal and if necessary constrain the amount of variable consideration recognized in order to mitigate this risk.\nAt the inception of a contract we estimate the transaction price based on our current rights and do not contemplate future modifications (including\nunexercised options) or follow-on contracts until they become legally enforceable. Contracts are often subsequently modified to include changes in\nspecifications, requirements or price, which may create new or change existing enforceable rights and obligations. Depending on the nature of the\nmodification, we consider whether to account for the modification as an adjustment to the existing contract or as a separate contract. Generally,\nmodifications to our contracts are not distinct from the existing contract due to the significant integration and interrelated tasks provided in the context of\nthe contract. Therefore, such modifications are accounted for as if they were part of the existing contract and recognized as a cumulative adjustment to\nrevenue.\nFor contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on the estimated\nstandalone selling price of the product or service underlying each performance obligation. The standalone selling price represents the amount we would sell\nthe product or service to a customer on a standalone basis (i.e., not bundled with any other products or services). Our contracts with the U.S. Government,\nincluding FMS contracts, are subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) and the price is typically based on estimated or actual costs plus a\nreasonable profit margin. As a result of these regulations, the standalone selling price of products or services in our contracts with the U.S. Government and\nFMS contracts are typically equal to the selling price stated in the contract.\nFor non-U.S. Government contracts with multiple performance obligations, we evaluate whet",

We primarily sell customized solutions unique to a customer’s specifications. When it is necessary to allocate the\ntransaction price to multiple performance obligations, we typically use the expected cost plus a reasonable profit margin to estimate the standalone selling\nprice of each product or service. We occasionally sell standard products or services with observable standalone sales transactions. In these situations, the\nobservable standalone sales transactions are used to determine the standalone selling price.\nWe recognize revenue as performance obligations are satisfied and the customer obtains control of the products and services. In determining when\nperformance obligations are satisfied, we consider factors such as contract terms, payment terms and whether there is an alternative future use of the\nproduct or service. Substantially all of our revenue is recognized over time as we perform under the contract because control of the work in process\ntransfers continuously to the customer. For most contracts with the U.S. Government and FMS contracts, this continuous transfer of control of the work in\nprocess to the customer is supported by clauses in the contract that give the customer ownership of work in process and allow the customer to unilaterally\nterminate the contract for convenience and pay us for costs incurred plus a reasonable profit. For most non-U.S. Government contracts, primarily\ninternational direct commercial contracts, continuous transfer of control to our customer is supported because we deliver products that do not have an\nalternative use to us and if our customer were to terminate the contract for reasons other than our non-performance we would have the right to recover\ndamages which would include, among other potential damages, the right to payment for our work performed to date plus a reasonable profit.\nFor performance obligations to deliver products with continuous transfer of control to the customer, revenue is recognized based on the extent of\nprogress towards completion of the performance obligation, generally using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress for our\ncontracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer as we incur costs on our contracts. Under the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost\nmeasure of progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs to\ncomplete the performance obligation(s). For performance obligations to provide services to the customer, revenue is recognized over time based on costs\nincurred or the right to invoice method (in situations where the value transferred matches our billing rights) as our customer receives and consumes the\nbenefits.\n73\n\n\nTable of Contents\nFor performance obligations in which control does not continuously transfer to",

This coincides with the point in time the customer obtains control of the product or service, which typically occurs\nupon customer acceptance or receipt of the product or service, given that we maintain control of the product or service until that point.\nBacklog (i.e., unfulfilled or remaining performance obligations) represents the sales we expect to recognize for our products and services for which\ncontrol has not yet transferred to the customer. It is converted into sales in future periods as work is performed or deliveries are made. For our cost-\nreimbursable and fixed-priced-incentive contracts, the estimated consideration we expect to receive pursuant to the terms of the contract may exceed the\ncontractual award amount. The estimated consideration is determined at the outset of the contract and is continuously reviewed throughout the contract\nperiod. In determining the estimated consideration, we consider the risks related to the technical, schedule and cost impacts to complete the contract and an\nestimate of any variable consideration. Periodically, we review these risks and may increase or decrease backlog accordingly. As the risks on such contracts\nare successfully retired, the estimated consideration from customers may be reduced, resulting in a reduction of backlog without a corresponding\nrecognition of sales. As of December 31, 2020, our ending backlog was $147.1 billion. We expect to recognize approximately 39% of our backlog over the\nnext 12 months and approximately 61% over the next 24 months as revenue, with the remainder recognized thereafter.\nFor arrangements with the U.S. Government and FMS contracts, we generally do not begin work on contracts until funding is appropriated by the\ncustomer. Billing timetables and payment terms on our contracts vary based on a number of factors, including the contract type. Typical payment terms\nunder fixed-price contracts with the U.S. Government provide that the customer pays either performance-based payments (PBPs) based on the achievement\nof contract milestones or progress payments based on a percentage of costs we incur. For the majority of our international direct commercial contracts to\ndeliver complex systems, we typically receive advance payments prior to commencement of work, as well as milestone payments that are paid in\naccordance with the terms of our contract as we perform. We recognize a liability for payments in excess of revenue recognized, which is presented as a\ncontract liability on the balance sheet. The portion of payments retained by the customer until final contract settlement is not considered a significant\nfinancing component because the intent is to protect the customer from our failure to adequately complete some or all of the obligations under the contract.\nPayments received from customers in advance of revenue recognition are not cons",

Amounts\nbilled and due from our customers under both contract types are classified as receivables on the balance sheet.\nSignificant estimates and assumptions are made in estimating contract sales and costs, including the profit booking rate. At the outset of a long-term\ncontract, we identify and monitor risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract, as well as variable consideration, and\nassess the effects of those risks on our estimates of sales and total costs to complete the contract. The estimates consider the technical requirements (e.g., a\nnewly-developed product versus a mature product), the schedule and associated tasks (e.g., the number and type of milestone events) and costs (e.g.,\nmaterial, labor, subcontractor, overhead, general and administrative and the estimated costs to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes\nreferred to as offset or localization agreements, required under certain contracts with international customers). The initial profit booking rate of each\ncontract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements, schedule and costs in the initial estimated total costs to complete the\ncontract. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the technical, schedule and\ncost aspects of the contract, which decreases the estimated total costs to complete the contract or may increase the variable consideration we expect to\nreceive on the contract. Conversely, our profit booking rates may decrease if the estimated total costs to complete the contract increase or our estimates of\nvariable consideration we expect to receive decrease. All of the estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect the\nprofit booking rate. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of the transaction price, a provision for the entire loss\nis determined at the contract level and is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined.\nComparability of our segment sales, operating profit and operating margin may be impacted favorably or unfavorably by changes in profit booking\nrates on our contracts for which we recognize revenue over time using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method to measure progress towards\ncompletion.

Company-funded R&D costs are allocated to customer contracts as part of the general\nand administrative overhead costs and generally recoverable on our customer contracts with the U.S. Government. Customer-funded R&D costs are\ncharged directly to the related customer contract. Substantially all R&D costs are charged to cost of sales as incurred. Company-funded R&D costs charged\nto cost of sales totaled $1.3 billion in each of 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nStock-based compensation – Compensation cost related to all share-based payments is measured at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of\nthe award. We generally recognize the compensation cost ratably over a three-year vesting period, net of estimated forfeitures. At each reporting date, the\nnumber of shares is adjusted to the number ultimately expected to vest.\nIncome taxes – We calculate our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are\nrecognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences that exist between the financial statement carrying amount of assets\nand liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as from operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities\nusing enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to be recovered or paid.\nWe periodically assess our tax exposures related to periods that are open to examination.

There were no significant impairment losses related to our receivables in 2020,\n2019 or 2018.\nContract assets – Contract assets include unbilled amounts typically resulting from sales under contracts when the percentage-of-completion cost-to-\ncost method of revenue recognition is utilized and revenue recognized exceeds the amount billed to the customer. The amounts may not exceed their\nestimated net realizable value. Contract assets are classified as current based on our contract operating cycle.\nInventories – We record inventories at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value. If events or changes in circumstances indicate that the utility\nof our inventories have diminished through damage, deterioration, obsolescence, changes in price or other causes, a loss is recognized in the period in\nwhich it occurs. We capitalize labor, material, subcontractor and overhead costs as work-in-process for contracts where control has not yet passed to the\ncustomer. In addition, we capitalize costs incurred to fulfill a contract in advance of contract award in inventories as work-in-process if we determine that\ncontract award is probable. We determine the costs of other product and supply inventories by using the first-in first-out or average cost methods.\nContract liabilities – Contract liabilities include advance payments and billings in excess of revenue recognized. Contract liabilities are classified as\ncurrent based on our contract operating cycle and reported on a contract-by-contract basis, net of revenue recognized, at the end of each reporting period.\nProperty, plant and equipment – We record property, plant and equipment at cost. We provide for depreciation and amortization on plant and\nequipment generally using accelerated methods during the first half of the estimated useful lives of the assets and the straight-line method thereafter. The\nestimated useful lives of our plant and equipment generally range from 10 to 40 years for buildings and five to 15 years for machinery and equipment.

Goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of\nacquired businesses. Intangible assets from acquired businesses are recognized at fair value on the acquisition date and consist of customer programs,\ntrademarks, customer relationships, technology and other intangible assets.

For selected reporting units where we\nuse the qualitative approach, we perform a qualitative evaluation of events and circumstances impacting the reporting unit to determine the likelihood of\ngoodwill impairment. Based on that qualitative evaluation, if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its\ncarrying amount, no further evaluation is necessary. Otherwise we perform a quantitative impairment test. We perform quantitative tests for most reporting\nunits at least once every three years. However, for certain reporting units we may perform a quantitative impairment test every year.\nFor the quantitative impairment test we compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of a\nreporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. If the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill,\nexceeds its fair value, a goodwill impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. We generally estimate the fair value of each reporting\nunit using a combination of a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis and market-based valuation methodologies such as comparable public company trading\nvalues and values observed in recent business acquisitions. Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgments, including the amount and\ntiming of expected future cash flows, long-term growth rates, discount rates and relevant comparable public company earnings multiples and relevant\ntransaction multiples. The cash flows employed in the DCF analysis are based on our best estimate of future sales, earnings and cash flows after\nconsidering factors such as general market conditions, U.S. Government budgets, existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers,\nlabor agreements, changes in working capital, long term business plans and recent operating performance. The discount rates utilized in the DCF analysis\nare based on the respective reporting unit’s weighted average cost of capital, which takes into account the relative weights of each component of capital\nstructure (equity and debt) and represents the expected cost of new capital, adjusted as appropriate to consider the risk inherent in future cash flows of the\nrespective reporting unit.

GAAP requires that the amounts we record related to our postretirement\nbenefit plans be computed, based on service to date, using actuarial valuations that are based in part on certain key economic assumptions we make,\nincluding the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and other actuarial assumptions including participant longevity (also known\nas mortality), health care cost trend rates and employee turnover, each as appropriate based on the nature of the plans.\nA market-related value of our plan assets, determined using actual asset gains or losses over the prior three year period, is used to calculate the amount\nof deferred asset gains or losses to be amortized. These asset gains or losses, along with those resulting from adjustments to our benefit obligation, will be\namortized to expense using the corridor method, where gains and losses are recognized over a period of years to the extent they exceed 10% of the greater\nof plan assets or benefit obligations. This amortization period extended in 2020 due to the freeze of our salaried pension plans to use the average remaining\nlife expectancy of the participants instead of average future service.\nWe recognize on a plan-by-plan basis the funded status of our postretirement benefit plans under GAAP as either an asset recorded within other\nnoncurrent assets or a liability recorded within noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. The GAAP funded status is measured as the\ndifference between the fair value of the plan’s assets and the benefit obligation of the plan.

Specifically, we consider whether we can\ncontrol the underlying asset and have the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits or outputs from the asset. Substantially all of our leases\nare long-term operating leases with fixed payment terms. We do not have significant financing leases. Our right-of-use (ROU) operating lease assets\nrepresent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and our operating lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments. ROU\noperating lease assets are recorded in other noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease liabilities are recorded in other current\nliabilities or other noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet based on their contractual due dates.\nBoth the ROU operating lease asset and liability are recognized as of the lease commencement date at the present value of the lease payments over the\nlease term. Most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate that can readily be determined. Therefore, we use a discount rate based on our incremental\nborrowing rate, which is determined using our credit rating and information available as of the commencement date. ROU operating lease assets include\nlease payments made at or before the lease commencement date, net of any lease incentives.\nOur operating lease agreements may include options to extend the lease term or terminate it early. We include options to extend or terminate leases in\nthe ROU operating lease asset and liability when it is reasonably certain we will exercise these\n87\n\n\nTable of Contents\noptions. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is included in cost of sales on our consolidated statement of\nearnings.\nWe have operating lease arrangements with lease and non-lease components. The non-lease components in our arrangements are not significant when\ncompared to the lease components. For all operating leases, we account for the lease and non-lease components as a single component. Additionally, for\ncertain equipment leases, we apply a portfolio approach to recognize operating lease ROU assets and liabilities. We evaluate ROU assets for impairment\nconsistent with our property, plant and equipment policy (see Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies).\nWe generally enter into operating lease agreements for facilities, land and equipment. Our ROU operating lease assets were $1.0 billion at\nDecember 31, 2020. Operating lease liabilities were $1.1 billion, of which $841 million were classified as noncurrent, at December 31, 2020",

Accordingly, unless otherwise indicated below in our discussion of\nlegal proceedings, a reasonably possible loss or range of loss associated with any individual legal proceeding cannot be estimated.\nLegal Proceedings\nAs a result of our acquisition of Sikorsky, we assumed the defense of and any potential liability for two civil False Claims Act lawsuits pending in the\nU.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. In October 2014, the U.S. Government filed a complaint in intervention in the first suit, which\nwas brought by qui tam relator Mary Patzer, a former Derco Aerospace (Derco) employee. In May 2017, the U.S. Government filed a complaint in\nintervention in the second suit, which was brought by qui tam relator Peter Cimma, a former Sikorsky Support Services, Inc. (SSSI) employee. In\nNovember 2017, the Court consolidated the cases into a single action for discovery and trial.\nThe U.S. Government alleges that Sikorsky and two of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Derco and SSSI, violated the civil False Claims Act and the\nTruth in Negotiations Act in connection with a contract the U.S. Navy awarded to SSSI in June 2006 to support the Navy’s T-34 and T-44 fixed-wing\nturboprop training aircraft. SSSI subcontracted with Derco, primarily to procure and manage spare parts for the training aircraft. The U.S. Government\ncontends that SSSI overbilled the Navy on the contract as the result of Derco’s use of prohibited cost-plus-percentage-of-cost pricing to add profit and\noverhead costs as a percentage of the price of the spare parts that Derco procured and then sold to SSSI. The U.S. Government also alleges that Derco’s\nclaims to SSSI, SSSI’s claims to the Navy, and SSSI’s yearly Certificates of Final Indirect Costs from 2006 through 2012 were false and that SSSI\nsubmitted inaccurate cost or pricing data in violation of the Truth in Negotiations Act for a sole-sourced, follow-on “bridge” contract. The U.S.\nGovernment’s complaints assert common law claims for breach of contract and unjust enrichment.\nThe U.S. Government further alleged violations of the Anti-Kickback Act and False Claims Act based on a monthly “chargeback,” through which\nSSSI billed Derco for the cost of certain SSSI personnel, allegedly in exchange for SSSI’s permitting a pricing arrangement that was “highly favorable” to\nDerco. On January 12, 2018, the Corporation filed a partial motion to dismiss intended to narrow the U.S. Government’s claims, including by seeking\ndismissal of the Anti-Kickback Act alle",

The District Court granted these motions, in part, on July 20, 2018, dismissing the Government’s\nclaims under the Anti-Kickback Act and dismissing Cimma as a party to the litigation.\nThe U.S. Government seeks damages of approximately $52 million, subject to trebling, plus statutory penalties. We believe that we have legal and\nfactual defenses to the U.S. Government’s remaining claims. Although we continue to evaluate our liability and exposure, we do not currently believe that\nit is probable that we will incur a material loss.

(LMSI) and a current Lockheed Martin vice president. The dollar amount of damages sought is not specified but DOJ seeks\ntreble damages with respect to the False Claims Act and penalties that are subject to doubling under the Anti-Kickback Act. The allegations relate primarily\nto information technology services performed by LMSI under a subcontract to MSA and the pricing by MSA and LMSI of those services as well as\nLockheed Martin’s payment of standard incentive compensation to certain employees who were seconded to MSA, including the vice president. MSA is a\njoint venture that holds a prime contract to provide infrastructure support services at DOE’s Hanford facility.

The MTA filed an answer and counterclaim alleging that we breached the contract and subsequently terminated the contract for\nalleged default. The primary damages sought by the MTA are the costs to complete the contract and potential re-procurement costs. While we are unable to\nestimate the cost of another contractor to complete the contract and the costs of re-procurement, we note that our contract with the MTA had a total value of\n$323 million, of which $241 million was paid to us, and that the MTA is seeking damages of approximately $190 million. We dispute the MTA’s\nallegations and are defending against them. Additionally, following an investigation, our sureties on a performance bond related to this matter, who were\nrepresented by independent counsel, concluded that the MTA’s termination of the contract was improper. Finally, our declaratory judgment action was later\namended to include claims for monetary damages against the MTA of approximately $95 million. This matter was taken under submission by the District\nCourt in December 2014, after a five-week bench trial and the filing of post-trial pleadings by the parties.

The fair values of mutual funds and certain\nother securities are determined by reference to the quoted market price per unit in active markets multiplied by the number of units held without\nconsideration of transaction costs. The fair values of U.S. Government and other securities are determined using pricing models that use observable inputs\n(e.g., interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals), bids provided by brokers or dealers or quoted prices of securities with\nsimilar characteristics. The fair values of derivative instruments, which consist of foreign currency forward contracts, including embedded derivatives, and\ninterest rate swap contracts, are primarily determined based on the present value of future cash flows using model-derived valuations that use observable\ninputs such as interest rates, credit spreads and foreign currency exchange rates.\nIn addition to the financial instruments listed in the table above, we hold other financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, receivables,\naccounts payable and debt and commercial paper. The carrying amounts for cash and cash equivalents, receivables and accounts payable approximated\ntheir fair values. The estimated fair value of our outstanding debt was $16.9 billion and $15.9 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019. The outstanding\nprincipal amount was $13.3 billion and $13.8 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, excluding $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion of unamortized discounts and\nissuance costs at December 31, 2020 and 2019.

A company’s\ninternal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded\nas necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures\nof the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance\nregarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the\nfinancial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any\nevaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree\nof compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nTysons, Virginia\nJanuary 28, 2021\n108\n\n\nTable of Contents\nITEM 9B.
