--- Question ---
What drove operating margin change as of FY2022 for 3M? If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then please state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
3M's operating margin decreased from 20.9% in FY2021 to 19.1% in FY2022, driven by decreased demand for disposable respirators, foreign currency impacts, increased raw materials and logistics costs, and significant special item charges related to litigation and restructuring.

--- Ground Truth ---
['Operating Margin for 3M in FY2022 has decreased by 1.7% primarily due to: \n-Decrease in gross Margin\n-mostly one-off charges including Combat Arms Earplugs litigation, impairment related to exiting PFAS manufacturing, costs related to exiting Russia and divestiture-related restructuring\ncharges']

--- Correctness Evaluation ---
Is correct: True
Confidence: 0.90
Reasoning: The predicted answer correctly identifies the decrease in 3M's operating margin from FY2021 to FY2022 and attributes it to factors such as special item charges related to litigation and restructuring, which aligns with the ground truth. Although the predicted answer includes additional context like decreased demand for disposable respirators and foreign currency impacts, these do not contradict the ground truth and provide further detail. The numerical change in operating margin is within the 10% tolerance range.
