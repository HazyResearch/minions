--- Question ---
We need to calculate a reasonable approximation (or exact number if possible) of a financial metric. Basing your judgment by information plainly provided in the balance sheet and the P&L statement, what is Lockheed Martin's FY2020 asset turnover ratio? Asset turnover ratio is defined as: FY2020 revenue / (average total assets between FY2019 and FY2020). Round your answer to two decimal places.

--- Predicted Answer ---
47.12

--- Ground Truth ---
['1.33']

--- Correctness Evaluation ---
Is correct: False
Confidence: 1.00
Reasoning: The predicted answer of 47.12 is significantly outside the 10% tolerance range of the ground truth answer of 1.33. The correct range would be 1.20 to 1.46, and 47.12 is far beyond this range, indicating a clear error in the prediction.
