--- Question ---
We need to calculate a reasonable approximation (or exact number if possible) of a financial metric. Basing your judgment by information plainly provided in the statement of income, what is Nike's three year average of cost of goods sold as a % of revenue from FY2016 to FY2018? Answer in units of percents and round to one decimal place.

--- Predicted Answer ---
56.2%

--- Ground Truth ---
['55.1%']

--- Correctness Evaluation ---
Is correct: True
Confidence: 0.90
Reasoning: The ground truth answer is 55.1%, and the predicted answer is 56.2%. The 10% tolerance for the ground truth of 55.1% is 5.51%, which means any answer between 49.59% and 60.61% is acceptable. Since 56.2% falls within this range, the predicted answer is correct.
