--- Question ---
Has AMCOR's quick ratio improved or declined between FY2023 and FY2022? If the quick ratio is not something that a financial analyst would ask about a company like this, then state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
The quick ratio for AMCOR cannot be determined due to insufficient financial data for FY2023 and FY2022. The document excerpts reviewed do not contain the necessary financial figures to calculate the quick ratio for these fiscal years.

--- Ground Truth ---
['The quick ratio has slightly improved from 0.67 times to 0.69 times between FY 2023 and FY 2022.(3.4% jump)']

--- Correctness Evaluation ---
Is correct: False
Confidence: 0.90
Reasoning: The predicted answer states that the quick ratio cannot be determined due to insufficient data, which contradicts the ground truth answer that provides specific figures showing an improvement in the quick ratio. The predicted answer fails to align with the key facts and conclusions of the ground truth.
