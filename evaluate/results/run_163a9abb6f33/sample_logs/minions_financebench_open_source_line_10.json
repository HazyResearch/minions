  "correctness_reasoning": "The predicted answer provides the capex as a percentage of revenue for each fiscal year (FY2017: 2.2%, FY2018: 1.7%, FY2019: 1.8%) and correctly calculates the 3-year average as 1.9%. This matches the ground truth answer. The additional context of individual yearly percentages does not contradict the ground truth and is within the evaluation rules."
