--- Question ---
Has Microsoft increased its debt on balance sheet between FY2023 and the FY2022 period?

--- Predicted Answer ---
The available data does not allow us to determine whether Microsoft's debt increased between FY2022 and FY2023 due to inconsistent and unreliable figures.

--- Ground Truth ---
['No. Microsoft decreased its debt by $2.5bn in FY 2023 vs FY 2022.']

--- Correctness Evaluation ---
Is correct: False
Confidence: 0.90
Reasoning: The predicted answer does not match the ground truth answer. The ground truth states that Microsoft's debt decreased by $2.5bn, which is a clear 'No' to the question of whether the debt increased. The predicted answer fails to provide a definitive stance and suggests uncertainty, which does not align with the ground truth.
