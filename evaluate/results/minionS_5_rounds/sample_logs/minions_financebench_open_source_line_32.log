--- Question ---
Does AMD have a reasonably healthy liquidity profile based on its quick ratio for FY22? If the quick ratio is not relevant to measure liquidity, please state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
The information is insufficient to determine if AMD has a reasonably healthy liquidity profile based on its quick ratio for FY22. The quick ratio calculation requires accurate figures for current assets, inventory, and current liabilities, but the current liabilities data is inconsistent.

--- Ground Truth ---
['Yes. The quick ratio is 1.57, calculated as (cash and cash equivalents+Short term investments+Accounts receivable, net+receivables from related parties)/ (current liabilities).']

--- Correctness Evaluation ---
Is correct: False
Confidence: 0.90
Reasoning: The predicted answer incorrectly states that there is insufficient information to determine AMD's liquidity profile based on the quick ratio. The ground truth provides a specific quick ratio value of 1.57, which is within a reasonable range to assess liquidity. The predicted answer's claim about inconsistent data is not supported by the ground truth.
