Does 3M have a reasonably healthy liquidity profile based on its quick ratio for Q2 of FY2023? If the quick ratio is not relevant to measure liquidity, please state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
The quick ratio for 3M in Q2 of FY2023 is approximately 0.85, suggesting a less than ideal liquidity position.

--- Ground Truth ---
["No. The quick ratio for 3M was 0.96 by Jun'23 close, which needs a bit of an improvement to touch the 1x mark"]
