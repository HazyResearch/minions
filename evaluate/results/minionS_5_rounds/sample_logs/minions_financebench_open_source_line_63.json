  "predicted_answer": "Boeing's gross margin for FY2022 is approximately 5.3%.",
  "ground_truth": [
    "Yes. Boeing has an improving gross margin profile as of FY2022. Gross profit improved from $3,017 million in FY2021 to $3,502 million in FY2022. Gross margin % improved from 4.8% in FY2021 to 5.3% in FY2022."

  "correctness_reasoning": "The predicted answer provides the gross margin percentage for FY2022 but does not address whether Boeing's gross margin profile is improving. The ground truth answer indicates an improvement in both gross profit and gross margin percentage from FY2021 to FY2022, which the predicted answer fails to mention. Therefore, it does not fully align with the ground truth answer."
