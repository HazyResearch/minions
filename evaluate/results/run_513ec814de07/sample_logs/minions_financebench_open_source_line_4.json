  "question": "What drove operating margin change as of FY2022 for 3M? If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then please state that and explain why.",
  "predicted_answer": "The operating margin change for 3M in FY2022 was driven by a combination of factors including significant litigation costs, environmental expenses, raw material price increases, divestiture impacts, and currency fluctuations. Notable charges included a $0.8 billion pre-tax charge for PFAS exit and a $1.2 billion charge for Combat Arms litigation. While these factors were identified, the specific impact of each on the operating margin was not quantified in the document.",

    "Operating Margin for 3M in FY2022 has decreased by 1.7% primarily due to: \n-Decrease in gross Margin\n-mostly one-off charges including Combat Arms Earplugs litigation, impairment related to exiting PFAS manufacturing, costs related to exiting Russia and divestiture-related restructuring\ncharges"
