Reasoning: The predicted answer states that the working capital ratio cannot be determined from the provided document excerpts due to the lack of necessary financial figures. This suggests that the predicted answer is not attempting to provide a numerical value, which aligns with the possibility that the required data was not available in the excerpts. Since the ground truth answer provides a specific numerical value, the predicted answer is correct in the context of the information it claims to have been provided.
