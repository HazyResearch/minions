Total length: 346534 characters to answer this question. \n\nAlso consider the following constraints:\n- In your response do NOT use numbered lists.\n- Do NOT structure your response as a sequence of steps.\n",
      "output": "To answer the question about Best Buy's 3-year average net profit margin from FY2015 to FY2017, focus on extracting specific financial data from the income statement. Key information includes the net profit (or net income) and total revenue for each fiscal year within the specified period. The net profit margin is calculated by dividing the net profit by total revenue and then multiplying by 100 to convert it into a percentage. Once you have the net profit margins for each year, calculate the average of these percentages over the three years. Ensure that all figures are accurate and consistent with the fiscal years mentioned, and round the final average to one decimal place as required."

Instead, you can assign small, isolated tasks to a less capable worker model that sees only a single chunk of text at a time. Any cross-chunk or multi-document reasoning must be handled by you.\n\n## Your Job: Write Two Python Functions\n\n### FUNCTION #1: `prepare_jobs(context, prev_job_manifests, prev_job_outputs) -> List[JobManifest]`\n- Break the document(s) into chunks (using the provided chunking function, if needed). Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 12 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`. All **multi-chunk integration** or **global reasoning** is your responsibility here.\n- Return one **aggregated string** suitable for further supervisor inspection.\n\n\n\n## Relevant Pydantic Models\n\nThe following models are already in the global scope. **Do NOT redefine or re-import them.**\n\n### JobManifest Model\n```\nclass JobManifest(BaseModel):\n    chunk: str  # the actual text for the chunk of the document\n    task: str  # the actual task instruction for the small model\n    advice: str  # optional, any additional advice on how to perform the task\n\n    chunk_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    task_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    job_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n\n```\n\n### JobOutput Model\n```\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    citation: Optional[str]\n    answer: Optional[str]\n\n```\n\n## Function Signatures\n```\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        context (List[str]): A list of documents.

However, it is inferred to be around $40 billion based on the context and comparison with other years.\n\n2. **Missing Information:**\n   - The exact total revenue for FY2015 is not explicitly mentioned, but we can use the inferred value for calculation purposes.\n\n3. **Calculation of Net Profit Margin:**\n   - Net Profit Margin is calculated as \\((\\text{Net Profit} / \\text{Total Revenue}) \\times 100\\).\n   - For FY2015, using the inferred total revenue of $40 billion:\n     - Net Profit Margin = \\((1,235 / 40,000) \\times 100\\)\n   - For FY2016:\n     - Net Profit Margin = \\((897 / 39,528) \\times 100\\)\n   - For FY2017:\n     - Net Profit Margin = \\((1,228 / 39,403) \\times 100\\)\n\n4. **Average Net Profit Margin:**\n   - Calculate the average of the three years' net profit margins and round to one decimal place.\n\n5. **Conflicting Information:**\n   - There are some discrepancies in the reported figures, but the most consistent and cited figures are used for FY2016 and FY2017.
