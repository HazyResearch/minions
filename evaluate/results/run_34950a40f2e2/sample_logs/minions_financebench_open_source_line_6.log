--- Question ---
Does 3M have a reasonably healthy liquidity profile based on its quick ratio for Q2 of FY2023? If the quick ratio is not relevant to measure liquidity, please state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
3M does not have a reasonably healthy liquidity profile based on its quick ratio for Q2 FY2023, as the quick ratio is approximately 0.84, which is below the healthy threshold of 1.0. However, 3M's reliance on cash and commercial paper suggests alternative liquidity strategies.

--- Ground Truth ---
["No. The quick ratio for 3M was 0.96 by Jun'23 close, which needs a bit of an improvement to touch the 1x mark"]
