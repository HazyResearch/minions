Total length: 403648 characters.: \n\n## Question\nWhen primarily referencing the income statement and the statement of financial position, what is the FY2021 inventory turnover ratio for Nike? Inventory turnover ratio is defined as: (FY2021 COGS) / (average inventory between FY2020 and FY2021). Round your answer to two decimal places.\n\n---\n\nPlease provide succinct advice on the critical information we need to extract from the Financial document. Total length: 403648 characters to answer this question. \n\nAlso consider the following constraints:\n- In your response do NOT use numbered lists.\n- Do NOT structure your response as a sequence of steps.\n",
      "output": "To answer the question about Nike's FY2021 inventory turnover ratio, focus on extracting specific financial data from the document. You need the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) for FY2021, which is typically found on the income statement. Additionally, locate the inventory figures for both FY2020 and FY2021 from the statement of financial position, often referred to as the balance sheet. These inventory figures will allow you to calculate the average inventory for the two years. Once you have these numbers, you can compute the inventory turnover ratio by dividing the FY2021 COGS by the average inventory. Ensure that the final result is rounded to two decimal places for precision."

      "prompt": "# Decomposition Round #1\n\nYou (the supervisor) cannot directly read the document(s). Instead, you can assign small, isolated tasks to a less capable worker model that sees only a single chunk of text at a time. Any cross-chunk or multi-document reasoning must be handled by you.\n\n## Your Job: Write Two Python Functions\n\n### FUNCTION #1: `prepare_jobs(context, prev_job_manifests, prev_job_outputs) -> List[JobManifest]`\n- Break the document(s) into chunks (using the provided chunking function, if needed). Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 12 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`. All **multi-chunk integration** or **global reasoning** is your responsibility here.\n- Return one **aggregated string** suitable for further supervisor inspection.\n\n\n\n## Relevant Pydantic Models\n\nThe following models are already in the global scope. **Do NOT redefine or re-import them.**\n\n### JobManifest Model\n```\nclass JobManifest(BaseModel):\n    chunk: str  # the actual text for the chunk of the document\n    task: str  # the actual task instruction for the small model\n    advice: str  # optional, any additional advice on how to perform the task\n\n    chunk_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    task_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    job_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n\n```\n\n### JobOutput Model\n```\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    citation: Optional[str]\n    answer: Optional[str]\n\n```\n\n## Function Signatures\n```\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        context (List[str]): A list of documents.

If global economic and financial market conditions deteriorate, the following\nfactors could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition:\n• Our sales are impacted by discretionary spending by consumers. Declines in consumer spending have in the past and in the future may result in reduced demand for our\nproducts, increased inventories, reduced orders from retailers for our products, order cancellations, lower revenues, higher discounts and lower gross margins.\n• In the future, we may be unable to access financing in the credit and capital markets at reasonable rates in the event we find it desirable to do so.\n• We conduct transactions in various currencies, which creates exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar. Continued volatility in\nthe markets and exchange rates for foreign currencies and contracts in foreign currencies could have a significant impact on our reported operating results and financial\ncondition.\n• Continued volatility in the availability and prices for commodities and raw materials we use in our products and in our supply chain (such as cotton or petroleum\nderivatives) could have a material adverse effect on our costs, gross margins and profitability.\n• If retailers of our products experience declining revenues or experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit markets to purchase our products, this could\nresult in reduced orders for our products, order cancellations, late retailer payments, extended payment terms, higher accounts receivable, reduced cash flows, greater\nexpense associated with collection efforts and increased bad debt expense.\n• If retailers of our products experience severe financial difficulty, some may become insolvent and cease business operations, which could negatively impact the sale of our\nproducts to consumers. If contract manufacturers of our products or other participants in our supply chain experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit\nmarkets to purchase raw materials or to finance capital equipment and other general working capital needs, it may result in delays or non-delivery of shipments of our\nproducts.\nOur products, services and experiences face intense competition.\nNIKE is a consumer products company and the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products,\nservices and experiences.

The misuse of a brand by or negative publicity involving a licensee could have a material adverse effect on that brand and on us.\nConsolidation of retailers or concentration of retail market share among a few retailers may increase and concentrate our credit risk and impair our ability to sell\nproducts.\nThe athletic footwear, apparel and equipment retail markets in some countries are dominated by a few large athletic footwear, apparel and equipment retailers with many\nstores and accelerating digital commerce capabilities. The market shares of these retailers may increase through acquisitions and construction of additional stores and\ninvestments in digital capacity, and as a result of attrition as struggling retailers exit the market. Consolidation of our retailers will concentrate our credit risk with a smaller set of\nretailers, any of whom may experience declining sales or a shortage of liquidity, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, increasing market share\nconcentration among a few retailers in a particular country or region increases the risk that if any one of them substantially reduces their purchases of our products, we may be\nunable to find sufficient retail outlets for our products to sustain the same level of sales and revenues.\nIf one or more of our counterparty financial institutions default on their obligations to us or fail, we may incur significant losses.\nAs part of our hedging activities, we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments, which may include forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, option\ncontracts, collars and swaps with various financial institutions. In addition, we have significant amounts of cash, cash equivalents and other investments on deposit or in\naccounts with banks or other financial institutions in the United States and abroad. As a result, we are exposed to the risk of default by or failure of counterparty financial\ninstitutions.

These figures do not include beneficial owners who hold shares in nominee name. The\nClass A Common Stock is not publicly traded, but each share is convertible upon request of the holder into one share of Class B Common Stock. Refer to our Consolidated\nStatements of Shareholders' Equity for dividends declared on the Class A and Class B Common Stock.\nIn June 2018, the Board of Directors approved a four-year, $15 billion share repurchase program. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, to enhance our liquidity position in\nresponse to COVID-19, we elected to temporarily suspend share repurchases under our existing share repurchase program.

Consumers are\ndemanding a constant flow of fresh and innovative product, and have an expectation for superior service and rapid delivery, all fueled by the shift toward digital and mono-\nbrand experiences in NIKE Direct. We anticipate continued evolution within the retail landscape, driven by shifting consumer traffic patterns across digital and physical\nchannels. Specifically in North America, we remain focused on building long-term momentum with our strategic wholesale customers, which offer a differentiated retail\nexperience. Additionally, over the last three years we have significantly reduced the number of undifferentiated wholesale accounts.

Gross margin\nincreased approximately 430 basis points, primarily due to lower other costs, higher full-price ASP, reflecting lower discounts, the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct\nbusiness and lower product costs. The decrease in other costs was primarily due to annualizing the impacts of COVID-19 from fiscal 2020, including lower factory cancellation\ncharges, lower inventory obsolescence reserves and the favorable rate impact of fixed supply chain costs on a higher volume of wholesale shipments.

Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are:\n• Product Costs — NIKE's product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways:\n1.\nProduct purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity:\na.\nCertain NIKE entities purchase product from the NTC, a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from third-party factories, predominantly\nin U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the products to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies. NTC\nsales to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency results in a foreign currency exposure for the NTC.\nb.\nOther NIKE entities purchase product directly from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE\nentities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar.\nIn both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U.S. Dollar reduces inventory costs incurred by NIKE whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar increases its cost.\n2.\nFactory input costs: NIKE operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign\ncurrency risk by assuming certain of the factories' foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures. Under\nthis program, our payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies (“factory currency exposure index”) in which the labor,\nmaterials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products (“factory input costs”) are denominated.\nFor the currency within the factory currency exposure indices that is the local or functional currency of the factory, the currency rate fluctuation affecting the product\ncost is recorded within Inventories and is recognized in Cost of sales when the related product is sold to a third-party. All currencies within the indices, excluding the\nU.S. Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory, are recognized as embedded derivative contracts and are recorded at fair value through Other (income)\nexpense, net.

Payment terms for wholesale\ntransactions depend on the country of sale or agreement with the customer and payment is generally required within 90 days or less of shipment to or receipt by the wholesale\ncustomer. Payment is due at the time of sale for retail store and digital commerce transactions.\nAs part of our revenue recognition policy, consideration promised in our contracts with customers is variable due to anticipated reductions, such as sales returns, discounts and\nmiscellaneous claims from customers. We estimate the most likely amount we will be entitled to receive and record an anticipated reduction against Revenues, with an\noffsetting increase to Accrued liabilities at the time revenues are recognized. The estimated cost of inventory for product returns is recorded in Prepaid expenses and other\ncurrent assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe provision for anticipated sales returns consists of both contractual return rights and discretionary authorized returns. Provisions for post-invoice sales discounts consist of\nboth contractual programs and discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted at a later date.\nEstimates of discretionary authorized returns, discounts and claims are based on (1) historical rates, (2) specific identification of outstanding returns not yet received from\ncustomers and outstanding discounts and claims and (3) estimated returns, discounts and claims expected but not yet finalized with customers. Actual returns, discounts and\nclaims in any future period are inherently uncertain and may differ from estimates recorded.

Periods prior to fiscal 2020 have not been restated and\ncontinue to be reported in accordance with the Company's historical accounting policies. The Company's lease recognition policies under Topic 842 are described in the\nfollowing paragraphs.\nThe Company primarily leases retail store space, certain distribution and warehouse facilities, office space, equipment and other non-real estate assets. The Company\ndetermines if an arrangement is a lease at inception and begins recording lease activity at the commencement date, which is generally the date in which the Company takes\npossession of or controls the physical use of the asset. Lease components are not separated from nonlease components for real estate leases within the Company's lease\nportfolio. Right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term with lease expense recognized on a\nstraight-line basis. The Company's incremental borrowing rate is used to determine the present value of future lease payments unless the implicit rate is readily determinable.\nLease agreements may contain rent escalation clauses, renewal or termination options, rent holidays or certain landlord incentives, including tenant improvement allowances.\nROU assets include amounts for scheduled rent increases and are reduced by the amount of lease incentives. The lease term includes the non-cancelable period of the lease\nand options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain the Company will exercise those options. The Company does not record leases with an initial term of\n12 months or less on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and recognizes related lease payments in the Consolidated Statements of Income on a straight-line basis over the\nlease term. Certain lease agreements include variable lease\n2021 FORM 10-K 66\n\n\nTable of Contents\npayments, which are based on a percent of retail sales over specified levels or adjust periodically for inflation as a result of changes in a published index, primarily the\nConsumer Price Index, and are expensed as incurred.\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nThe Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis, including derivatives, equity securities and available-for-sale debt securities.\nFair value is the price the Company would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date.

The Company's bilateral credit-related contingent features generally require the\nowing entity, either the Company or the derivative counterparty, to post collateral for the portion of the fair value in excess of $50 million should the fair value of outstanding\nderivatives per counterparty be greater than $50 million. Additionally, a certain level of decline in credit rating of either the Company or the counterparty could trigger collateral\nrequirements. As of May 31, 2021, the Company was in compliance with all credit risk-related contingent features, and derivative instruments with such features were in a net\nliability position of approximately $364 million. Accordingly, the Company posted $39 million of cash collateral as a result of these contingent features. Further, as of May 31,\n2021, the Company had received no cash collateral from various counterparties to its derivative contracts. The Company considers the impact of the risk of counterparty\ndefault to be immaterial.\nFor additional information related to the Company's derivative financial instruments and collateral, refer to Note 6 — Fair Value Measurements.\nNOTE 15 — ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)\nThe changes in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, were as follows:\n(Dollars in millions)\nFOREIGN\nCURRENCY\nTRANSLATION\nADJUSTMENT\nCASH FLOW\nHEDGES\nNET\nINVESTMENT\nHEDGES\nOTHER\nTOTAL\nBalance at May 31, 2020\n$\n(494) $\n390 $\n115 $\n(67) $\n(56)\nOther comprehensive income (loss):\nOther comprehensive gains (losses) before reclassifications\n499 \n(788)\n— \n(8)\n(297)\nReclassifications to net income of previously deferred (gains) losses\n(3)\n(37)\n— \n13 \n(27)\nTotal other comprehensive income (loss)\n496 \n(825)\n— \n5 \n(324)\nBalance at May 31, 2021\n$\n2 $\n(435) $\n115 $\n(62) $\n(380)\n(1)\nThe accumulated foreign currency translation adjustment and net investment hedge gains/losses related to an investment in a foreign subsidiary are reclassified to Net income upon sale or upon complete or\nsubstantially complete liquidation of the respective entity.\n(2)\nN",

Currently, the Company has several such agreements in place. However, based on the\nCompany's historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, the Company has determined the fair value of such indemnification is not material to the\nCompany's financial position or results of operations.\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company is involved in various legal proceedings involving contractual and employment relationships, product liability claims, trademark\nrights and a variety of other matters. While the Company cannot predict the outcome of its pending legal matters with certainty, the Company does not believe any currently\nidentified claim, proceeding or litigation, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material impact on the Company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nNOTE 19 — LEASES\nLease expense is recognized in Cost of sales or Operating overhead expense within the Consolidated Statements of Income, based on the underlying nature of the leased\nasset.

What information we have gathered\n2. Whether it is sufficient to answer the question\n3. If not sufficient, what specific information is missing\n4. If sufficient, how we would calculate or derive the answer\n5. If there are conflicting answers:\n--> Use citations to select the correct answer if there are conflicting answers.\n\nBe brief and concise. No need for structured output - just think through the steps. You MUST respond in markdown format (for $ signs make sure to use escape character \\ before the $ sign).\n",
      "output": "We have attempted to extract the necessary financial data to calculate Nike's FY2021 inventory turnover ratio, but the collected outputs indicate that we have not successfully retrieved any of the required figures. Specifically, we have:\n\n1. FY2021 COGS: None\n2. FY2020 Inventory: None\n3. FY2021 Inventory: Not found\n\nGiven this, we cannot calculate the inventory turnover ratio because:\n\n- We need the FY2021 Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) to serve as the numerator in the inventory turnover ratio formula.\n- We need both the FY2020 and FY2021 inventory values to calculate the average inventory, which serves as the denominator.\n\nSince all these critical pieces of information are missing, we cannot proceed with calculating the inventory turnover ratio. To resolve this, we need to re-examine the financial documents to accurately extract the FY2021 COGS and the inventory values for both FY2020 and FY2021. Once we have these figures, we can compute the inventory turnover ratio using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{FY2021 COGS}}{\\text{Average Inventory (FY2020 and FY2021)}}\n\\]\n\nwhere the average inventory is calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average Inventory} = \\frac{\\text{FY2020 Inventory} + \\text{FY2021 Inventory}}{2}\n\\] \n\nWe need to ensure that the extraction tasks are correctly identifying and retrieving these values from the financial documents."

Air Manufacturing Innovation also manufactures and sells small amounts of various other plastic\nproducts to other manufacturers. The principal materials used in our apparel products are natural and synthetic fabrics, yarns and threads (both virgin and recycled);\nspecialized performance fabrics designed to efficiently wick moisture away from the body, retain heat and repel rain and/or snow; and plastic and metal hardware. NIKE's\nindependent contractors and suppliers buy raw materials for the manufacturing of our footwear, apparel and equipment products. Most raw materials are available and\npurchased by those independent contractors and suppliers in the countries where manufacturing takes place.

We have not, to date, been materially affected by any such risk but cannot predict the\nlikelihood of such material effects occurring in the future.\nIn recent years, uncertain global and regional economic and political conditions have affected international trade and increased protectionist actions around the world. These\ntrends are affecting many global manufacturing and service sectors, and the footwear and apparel industries, as a whole, are not immune. Companies in our industry are\nfacing trade protectionism in many different regions, and, in nearly all cases, we are working together with industry groups to address trade issues and reduce the impact to the\nindustry, while observing applicable competition laws. Notwithstanding our efforts, protectionist measures have resulted in increases in the cost of our products, and additional\nmeasures, if implemented, could adversely affect sales and/or profitability for NIKE, as well as the imported footwear and apparel industry as a whole.\nWe monitor protectionist trends and developments throughout the world that may materially impact our industry, and we engage in administrative and judicial processes to\nmitigate trade restrictions.

We also may need to expend significant resources to protect against, respond to and/or redress problems caused by any breach.\nIn addition, we must comply with increasingly complex and rigorous, and sometimes conflicting, regulatory standards enacted to protect business and personal data in the\nUnited States, Europe and elsewhere. For example, the European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), which became effective on May 25,\n2018; and California passed the California Consumer Privacy Act (the \"CCPA\") which became effective on January 1, 2020, and additional jurisdictions are considering\nproposing or adopting similar regulations. These laws impose additional obligations on companies regarding the handling of personal data and provide certain individual\nprivacy rights to persons whose data is stored. Compliance with existing, proposed and recently enacted laws (including implementation of the privacy and process\nenhancements called for under GDPR and CCPA) and regulations can be costly and time consuming, and any failure to comply with these regulatory standards could subject\nus to legal and reputational risks. Misuse of or failure to secure personal information could also result in violation of data privacy laws and regulations, proceedings against the\nCompany by governmental entities or others, imposition of fines by governmental authorities and damage to our reputation and credibility and could have a negative impact on\nrevenues and profits.\nWe could be subject to changes in tax rates, adoption of new tax laws, additional tax liabilities or increased volatility in our effective tax rate.\nWe earn a substantial portion of our income in foreign countries and, as ",

Selling and administrative expense decreased due to lower Demand creation expense, partially offset by\nhigher Operating overhead expense. Demand creation expense decreased primarily due to lower marketing and advertising expenses for our brand events and retail\noperations, as well as lower sports marketing expenses as sporting events were postponed due to COVID-19. These decreases were partially offset by higher digital marketing\ninvestments. Operating overhead expense increased primarily due to an increase in strategic technology investments, higher NIKE Direct variable costs and $255 million in\nrestructuring-related costs, partially offset by lower bad debt expense and travel and related expenses.

The decrease in other costs was primarily due to annualizing the impacts of COVID-19, including lower inventory obsolescence reserves,\nas well as the favorable rate impact of fixed supply chain costs on a higher volume of wholesale shipments. Selling and administrative expense decreased due to lower\ndemand creation and operating overhead expense. The decrease in demand creation expense was primarily driven by lower retail brand presentation costs and lower sports\nmarketing expense.

The increase in revenues was driven by revenue growth across Western Europe, North\nAmerica and Asia. Wholesale revenues increased 13%, driven primarily by growth in Western Europe and Asia, in part due to the impacts of COVID-19 in the prior year. Direct\nto consumer revenues increased 24%, driven by strong digital sales growth across North America and Western Europe. Combined unit sales within the wholesale and direct to\nconsumer channels increased 9%, while ASP increased 8%, primarily due to growth in full-price sales, including through our digital channel.\nReported EBIT increased 83%, driven by higher revenues and lower selling and administrative expense. Gross margin was flat, as higher full-price ASP, net of discounts, and\nthe favorable rate impact of fixed supply chain costs on a higher volume of wholesale shipments was offset by higher product costs and unfavorable changes in standard\nforeign currency exchange rates.

Direct\nto consumer revenues increased 24%, driven by strong digital sales growth across North America and Western Europe. Combined unit sales within the wholesale and direct to\nconsumer channels increased 9%, while ASP increased 8%, primarily due to growth in full-price sales, including through our digital channel.\nReported EBIT increased 83%, driven by higher revenues and lower selling and administrative expense. Gross margin was flat, as higher full-price ASP, net of discounts, and\nthe favorable rate impact of fixed supply chain costs on a higher volume of wholesale shipments was offset by higher product costs and unfavorable changes in standard\nforeign currency exchange rates.

When we determine payments are probable, the amounts are reported in Demand creation expense ratably over the contract period\nbased on our best estimate of the endorser's performance. In these instances, to the extent actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the\nendorser's performance, adjustments to Demand creation expense may be recorded in a future period.\nCertain contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percent of sales of particular products, which we record in Cost of sales as the related\nsales occur. For contracts containing minimum guaranteed royalty payments, we record the amount of any guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of\nproduct within Demand creation expense.\nPROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND DEFINITE-LIVED ASSETS\nWe review the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the\nassets might not be recoverable.

When the designated amount of\nanticipated or actual transactions decline below hedged levels, or if it is no longer probable a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period\nor within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, we are required to reclassify the cumulative change in fair value of the over-hedged portion of the related hedge\ncontract from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to Other (income) expense, net during the quarter in which the decrease occurs.

The income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur.

For instance, the actual cash needs of our U.S. operations\nmay exceed our current expectations, or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities may be less than our current expectations. This would result in additional withholding tax\nexpense in the year we determined amounts were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore.\nOn a quarterly basis, we evaluate the probability a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions based\non factors including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, settled audit issues and new audit activity.

The amount of\nearnings indefinitely reinvested offshore is due to the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore operations and our expectations of the future cash needs of our U.S.\nand foreign entities. Withholding tax consequences are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore.\nWe carefully review all factors that drive the ultimate disposition of foreign earnings determined to be reinvested offshore and apply stringent standards to overcome the\npresumption of repatriation. Despite this approach, because the determination is based on expected working capital and other capital needs in jurisdictions where the earnings\nare generated, the possibility exists that foreign earnings declared as indefinitely reinvested may be repatriated. For instance, the actual cash needs of our U.S. operations\nmay exceed our current expectations, or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities may be less than our current expectations. This would result in additional withholding tax\nexpense in the year we determined amounts were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore.\nOn a quarterly basis, we evaluate the probability a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions based\non factors including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, settled audit issues and new audit activity.

All significant intercompany transactions and\nbalances have been eliminated.\nREVENUE RECOGNITION\nBeginning in fiscal 2019, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). The Company's\nrevenue recognition policies under Topic 606 are described in the following paragraphs.\nRevenue transactions associated with the sale of NIKE Brand footwear, apparel and equipment, as well as Converse products, comprise a single performance obligation,\nwhich consists of the sale of products to customers either through wholesale or direct to consumer channels. The Company satisfies the performance obligation and records\nrevenues when transfer of control to the customer has occurred, based on the terms of sale. A customer is considered to have control once they are able to direct the use and\nreceive substantially all of the benefits of the product.\nControl is transferred to wholesale customers upon shipment or upon receipt depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. Control transfers to\nretail store customers at the time of sale and to substantially all digital commerce customers upon shipment. The transaction price is determined based upon the invoiced sales\nprice, less anticipated sales returns, discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers. Payment terms for wholesale transactions depend on the country of sale or\nagreement with the customer and payment is generally required within 90 days or less of shipment to or receipt by the wholesale customer. Payment is due at the time of sale\nfor retail store and digital commerce transactions.\nConsideration for trademark licensing contracts is earned through sales-based or usage-based royalty arrangements, and the associated revenues are recognized over the\nlicense period.\nTaxes assessed by governmental authorities that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, and are collected by the Company from a\ncustomer, are excluded from Revenues and Cost of sales in the Consolidated ",

Operating results of the Converse brand are reported on a stand-alone basis.\nBASIS OF CONSOLIDATION\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of NIKE, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the \"Company\" or \"NIKE\"). All significant intercompany transactions and\nbalances have been eliminated.\nREVENUE RECOGNITION\nBeginning in fiscal 2019, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). The Company's\nrevenue recognition policies under Topic 606 are described in the following paragraphs.\nRevenue transactions associated with the sale of NIKE Brand footwear, apparel and equipment, as well as Converse products, comprise a single performance obligation,\nwhich consists of the sale of products to customers either through wholesale or direct to consumer channels. The Company satisfies the performance obligation and records\nrevenues when transfer of control to the customer has occurred, based on the terms of sale. A customer is considered to have control once they are able to direct the use and\nreceive substantially all of the benefits of the product.\nControl is transferred to wholesale customers upon shipment or upon receipt depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. Control transfers to\nretail store customers at the time of sale and to substantially all digital commerce customers upon shipment. The transaction price is determined based upon the invoiced sales\nprice, less anticipated sales returns, discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers. Payment terms for wholesale transactions depend on the country of sale or\nagreement with the customer and payment is generally required within 90 days or less of shipment to or receipt by the wholesale customer. Payment is due at the time of sale\nfor retail store and digital commerce transactions.\nConsideration for trademark licensing contracts is earned through sales-based or usage-based royalty arrangements, and the associated revenues are recognized over the\nlicense period.\nTaxes assessed by governmental authorities that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, and are collected by the Company from a\ncustomer, are excluded from Revenues and Cost of sales in the Consolidated ",

The Company may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is\nmore likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, the Company determines it is more likely\nthan not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is not impaired, no quantitative fair value measurement is necessary. If a quantitative fair value measurement calculation is\nrequired for these intangible assets, the Company primarily utilizes the relief-from-royalty method. This method assumes trade names and trademarks have value to the extent\ntheir owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them. This method requires the Company to estimate the future revenues for the related\nbrands, the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital. If the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible exceeds its fair value, the asset is\ndetermined to be impaired, and the Compa",

The Company is currently under audit by the IRS for fiscal years\n2017 through 2019. The Company has closed all U.S. federal income tax matters through fiscal 2016, with the exception of certain transfer pricing adjustments. Tax years after\n2010 remain open in certain major foreign jurisdictions. Although the timing of resolution of audits is not certain, the Company evaluates all domestic and foreign audit issues in\nthe aggregate, along with the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations, and estimates that it is reasonably possible the total gross unrecognized tax benefits could\ndecrease by up to $40 million within the next 12 months. In January 2019, the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether the Netherlands has\nbreached State Aid rules when granting certain tax rulings to the Company. The Company believes the investigation is without merit. If this matter is adversely resolved, the\nNetherlands may be required to assess additional amounts with respect to current and prior periods, and the Company's Netherlands income taxes in the future could\nincrease.\nThe Company historically provided for U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless they were considered indefinitely reinvested outside the\nUnited States. As a result of the enactment of the Tax Act, in fiscal 2018 the Company reevaluated its historic indefinite reinvestment assertion and determined that any\nhistorical or future undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries are no longer considered to be indefinitely reinvested. Effective January 1, 2020, however, the tax law in the\nNetherlands, one of the Company's major jurisdictions, changed.

The Company is currently under audit by the IRS for fiscal years\n2017 through 2019. The Company has closed all U.S. federal income tax matters through fiscal 2016, with the exception of certain transfer pricing adjustments. Tax years after\n2010 remain open in certain major foreign jurisdictions. Although the timing of resolution of audits is not certain, the Company evaluates all domestic and foreign audit issues in\nthe aggregate, along with the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations, and estimates that it is reasonably possible the total gross unrecognized tax benefits could\ndecrease by up to $40 million within the next 12 months. In January 2019, the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether the Netherlands has\nbreached State Aid rules when granting certain tax rulings to the Company. The Company believes the investigation is without merit. If this matter is adversely resolved, the\nNetherlands may be required to assess additional amounts with respect to current and prior periods, and the Company's Netherlands income taxes in the future could\nincrease.\nThe Company historically provided for U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless they were considered indefinitely reinvested outside the\nUnited States. As a result of the enactment of the Tax Act, in fiscal 2018 the Company reevaluated its historic indefinite reinvestment assertion and determined that any\nhistorical or future undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries are no longer considered to be indefinitely reinvested. Effective January 1, 2020, however, the tax law in the\nNetherlands, one of the Company's major jurisdictions, changed. As a result of the change in law, the Company's undistributed earnings in the Netherlands are subject to\nwithholding tax upon distribution. It is the Company's intention to indefinitely reinvest the historical earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries outside North America prior to\nMay 31, 2020, to ensure there is sufficient working capital to expand operations outside the United States.

      "output": "### Analysis\n\n1. **Information Gathered:**\n   - **FY2021 COGS:** Multiple outputs suggest the FY2021 Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) is $24,576 million. This value is consistently mentioned in several chunks with citations pointing to the income statement.\n   - **Inventory Values:**\n     - **FY2020 Inventory:** $7,367 million\n     - **FY2021 Inventory:** $6,854 million\n     - These values are extracted from the balance sheet section of the financial statements and are consistently reported in multiple outputs.\n\n2. **Sufficiency of Information:**\n   - The information gathered is sufficient to calculate the inventory turnover ratio. We have both the COGS for FY2021 and the inventory values for FY2020 and FY2021.\n\n3. **Calculation:**\n   - **Average Inventory:** \\((7,367 + 6,854) / 2 = 7,110.5\\) million\n   - **Inventory Turnover Ratio:** \\(\\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{24,576}{7,110.5} \\approx 3.46\\)\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The inventory turnover ratio for Nike in FY2021 is approximately 3.46, rounded to two decimal places.\n\n5. **Conflicting Answers:**\n   - There are no significant conflicting answers regarding the COGS and inventory values. The values used are consistently reported across multiple outputs with citations from the financial statements."
