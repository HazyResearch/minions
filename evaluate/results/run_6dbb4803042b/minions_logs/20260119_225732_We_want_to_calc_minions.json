Calculate unadjusted EBITDA using unadjusted operating income and D&A (from cash flow statement).\n\n---\n\nPlease provide succinct advice on the critical information we need to extract from the Financial document. Total length: 232930 characters to answer this question. \n\nAlso consider the following constraints:\n- In your response do NOT use numbered lists.\n- Do NOT structure your response as a sequence of steps.\n",
      "output": "To calculate the FY2015 unadjusted EBITDA % margin for Netflix, focus on extracting specific figures from the financial statements. From the statement of income, identify the total revenue and the operating income for FY2015. The operating income will serve as the unadjusted operating income. From the statement of cash flows, locate the depreciation and amortization (D&A) expenses for the same fiscal year. The unadjusted EBITDA is calculated by adding the D&A expenses to the unadjusted operating income. To find the EBITDA % margin, divide the unadjusted EBITDA by the total revenue and multiply by 100 to express it as a percentage. Ensure that all figures are consistent with the fiscal year 2015 and are extracted accurately from the respective financial statements."

      "prompt": "# Decomposition Round #1\n\nYou (the supervisor) cannot directly read the document(s). Instead, you can assign small, isolated tasks to a less capable worker model that sees only a single chunk of text at a time. Any cross-chunk or multi-document reasoning must be handled by you.\n\n## Your Job: Write Two Python Functions\n\n### FUNCTION #1: `prepare_jobs(context, prev_job_manifests, prev_job_outputs) -> List[JobManifest]`\n- Break the document(s) into chunks (using the provided chunking function, if needed). Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 12 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`. All **multi-chunk integration** or **global reasoning** is your responsibility here.\n- Return one **aggregated string** suitable for further supervisor inspection.\n\n\n\n## Relevant Pydantic Models\n\nThe following models are already in the global scope. **Do NOT redefine or re-import them.**\n\n### JobManifest Model\n```\nclass JobManifest(BaseModel):\n    chunk: str  # the actual text for the chunk of the document\n    task: str  # the actual task instruction for the small model\n    advice: str  # optional, any additional advice on how to perform the task\n\n    chunk_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    task_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    job_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n\n```\n\n### JobOutput Model\n```\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    citation: Optional[str]\n    answer: Optional[str]\n\n```\n\n## Function Signatures\n```\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        context (List[str]): A list of documents.

In July 2011, we separated the combined plans, making it necessary for members who wish to receive both DVDs-by-mail and streaming\ncontent to have two separate membership plans. Prior to these changes to our pricing and plan structure in 2011, we did not separately track streaming\nmemberships.\n(1)\nA membership (also referred to as a subscription or a member) is defined as the right to receive the Netflix service following sign-up and a method of\npayment being provided. Memberships are assigned to territories based on the geographic location used at time of sign-up as determined by our internal\nsystems, which utilize industry standard geo-location technology. We offer free-trial memberships to new and certain rejoining members. Total members\ninclude those who are on a free-trial as long as a method of payment has been provided. A membership is canceled and ceases to be reflected in the above\nmetrics as of the effective cancellation date. Voluntary cancellations become effective at the end of the prepaid membership period, while involuntary\ncancellation of the service, as a result of a failed method of payment, becomes effective immediately except in limited circumstances where a short grace\nperiod is offered to ensure the streaming service is not interrupted for members who are impacted by payment processing delays by our banks or integrated\npayment partners. The number of members in a grace period at any given point is not material.\n16\n\n\nTable of Contents\nItem 7.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOverview and Results of Operations\nThe following represents our consolidated performance highlights:\nAs of/ Year Ended December 31,\nChange\n \n2015\n2014\n2013\n2015 vs. 2014\n2014 vs. 2013\n \n(in thousands, except revenue per membership and percentages)\nGlobal streaming memberships\n74,762\n57,391\n44,350\n30 %\n29%\nGlobal streaming average monthly revenue per paying membership\n$\n8.15\n$\n8.20\n$\n8.03\n(1)%\n2%\nRevenues\n$\n6,779,511\n",

The decrease in operating income for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 is due primarily to\nincreased marketing and headcount costs to support our international expansion in addition to increased content expenses as we continue to acquire, license and\nproduce content, including more Netflix originals.

Our premium plan is priced at $11.99 per month and includes access to high definition and ultra-high definition quality content on four\nscreens concurrently.

In February 2015, we issued $1,500.0 million of long-term debt and in February 2014 we issued $400.0 million of long-term debt. The increases in\ncash in the year ended December 31, 2015 associated with the issuance of debt was partially offset by cash outflows from operations and investing activities. Long-\nterm debt, net of debt issuance costs, was $2,371.4 million and $885.8 million as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. See Note 5 of Item\n8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information.\nOur primary uses of cash include the acquisition, licensing and production of content, streaming delivery, marketing programs and payroll. Investments in\noriginal content and in particular content that we produce and own, require more cash upfront relative to licensed content. We expect to significantly increase our\ninvestments in global streaming content, particularly in original content, which could impact our liquidity and result in future negative free cash flows.\nAlthough we currently anticipate that cash flows from operations, together with our available funds, will continue to be sufficient to meet our cash needs for\nat least the next twelve months, to fund our continued content investments, we are likely to raise additional capital in future periods. Our ability to obtain this, or\nany additional financing that we may choose to, or need to, obtain to finance our international expansion, or investment in original content or otherwise, will\ndepend on, among other things, our development efforts, business plans, operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek\nfinancing. We may not be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or debt\nsecurities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock, and our stockholders may experience dilution.\n24\n\n\nTable of Contents\nAs of December 31, 2015, $200.3 million of cash and cash equivalents were held by our foreign subsidiaries.

The analysis is based on an estimate of the hypothetical changes\nin market value of the portfolio that would result from an immediate parallel shift in the yield curve of various magnitudes. This methodology assumes a more\nimmediate change in interest rates to reflect the current economic environment.\nThe following table presents the hypothetical fair values of our debt securities classified as short-term investments assuming immediate parallel shifts in the\nyield curve of 50 basis points (“BPS”), 100 BPS and 150 BPS.

As of December 31, 2014, a similar 100 basis point increase in the yield curve would have\nresulted in a $5.9 million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments\nprior to maturity.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $2.4 billion of debt, consisting of fixed rate unsecured debt in four tranches: $500.0 million of 5.375% notes due in 2021;\n$400.0 million of 5.750% notes due in 2024; $700.0 million of 5.50% notes due in 2022; and $800.0 million of 5.875% notes due in 2025. The fair value of our\ndebt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest.\nForeign Currency Risk\nInternational revenues and cost of revenues account for 29% and 39%, respectively of consolidated amounts for the year ended December 31, 2015.

The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of\nadoption of the ASU on its consolidated financial statements, but does not expect the impact to be material.\nCash Equivalents and Short-term Investments\nThe Company considers investments in instruments purchased with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. The Company also\nclassifies amounts in transit from payment processors for customer credit card and debit card transactions as cash equivalents.\nThe Company classifies short-term investments, which consist of marketable securities with original maturities in excess of 90 days as available-for-sale.\nShort-term investments are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” within Stockholders’ equity\nin the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amortization of premiums and discounts on the investments, realized gains and losses, and declines in value judged to be\nother-than-temporary on available-for-sale securities are included in “Interest and other income (expense)” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The\nCompany uses the specific identification method to determine cost in calculating realized gains and losses upon the sale of short-term investments.\nShort-term investments are reviewed periodically to identify possible other-than-temporary impairment. When evaluating the investments, the Company\nreviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer, the Company’s intent to\nsell, or whether it would be more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell the investments before the recovery of their amortized cost basis.\nStreaming Content\nThe Company acquires, licenses and produces content, including original programming, in order to offer members unlimited viewing of TV shows and films.\nThe content licenses are for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability. Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more\nupfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense. Payments for content, including additions to streaming assets and the changes in related liabilities, are\nclassified within \"Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities\" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nFor licenses, the Company capitalizes the fee per title and records a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins,\nthe cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming.

Gains and losses from these\ntranslations are recognized in cumulative translation adjustment included in \"Accumulated other comprehensive loss\" in Stockholders’ equity on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheets.\nPrior to January 1, 2015, the functional currency of certain of the Company's European entities was the British pound. The Company changed the functional\ncurrency of these entities to the euro effective January 1, 2015 following the redomiciliation of the European headquarters and the launch of the Netflix service in\nseveral significant European countries. The change in functional currency was applied prospectively from January 1, 2015. Monetary assets and liabilities have\nbeen remeasured to the euro at current exchange rates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities have been remeasured to the euro using the exchange rate effective for\nthe period in which the balance arose. As a result of this change of functional currency, the Company recorded a $21.8 million cumulative translation adjustment\nincluded in other comprehensive loss for year ended December 31, 2015.\nThe Company remeasures monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency at exchange rates in effect at the end of each\nperiod. Gains and losses from these remeasurements are recognized in interest and other income (expense). Foreign currency transactions resulted in losses of\n$37.3 million , $8.2 million , and $8.4 million for the years ended December ",

The International streaming segment derives revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of streaming content to\nmembers outside of the United States. The Domestic DVD segment derives revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of DVD-by-\nmail.

Segment information is presented along the\nsame lines that the Company’s chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\") reviews the operating results in assessing performance and allocating resources. The\nCompany’s CODM reviews revenue and contribution profit (loss) for each of the reportable segments.

The Company has aggregated the results of the International operating segments into one reportable\nsegment because these operating segments share similar long-term economic and other qualitative characteristics.\nThe Domestic streaming segment derives revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of streaming content to the members in the\nUnited States. The International streaming segment derives revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of streaming content to\nmembers outside of the United States. The Domestic DVD segment derives revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of DVD-by-\nmail. Revenues and the related payment card fees are attributed to the operating segment based on the nature of the underlying membership (streaming or DVD)\nand the geographic region from which the membership originates. There are no internal revenue transactions between the Company’s segments.\nThe majority of cost of revenues relate to content expenses directly incurred by the segment. However, in connection with global expansion, content\nacquired, licensed, and produced increasingly includes global rights. The Company allocates this content between the International and Domestic streaming\nsegments based on estimated fair market value.

It focuses on extracting specific financial figures: total revenue, operating income, and D&A expenses for FY2015. Each task is designed to be simple and focused on a single piece of information.\n\n- **transform_outputs**: This function filters and aggregates the outputs from the small language models. It ensures that only non-empty answers are included and organizes the results by task and chunk. The aggregated string provides a structured view of the extracted data, which can be used to calculate the unadjusted EBITDA % margin."

We began our international expansion with Canada in 2010 and have since\nlaunched our service globally, with the exception of The People's Republic of China and territories where U.S. companies are not allowed to operate. We have also\nexpanded our streaming content offering to include more exclusive and original programming, including several Emmy, Golden Globe and Academy Award\nnominated original series and documentaries. Our original programming increasingly includes content that we produce.\n \nBUSINESS SEGMENTS\nThe Company has three reportable segments: Domestic streaming, International streaming and Domestic DVD. The Domestic streaming segment derives\nrevenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of streaming content to our members in the United States. The International streaming\nsegment derives revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of streaming content to our members outside the United States. The\nDomestic DVD segment derives revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of DVD-by-mail. For additional information regarding our\nsegments, including information about our financial results by geography, see Note 12 of Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data .\n1\n\n\nTable of Contents\nCOMPETITION\nThe market for entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. We compete against other entertainment video providers, such as\nmultichannel video programming distributors (\"MVPDs\"), Internet-based movie and TV content providers (including those that provide pirated content), video\ngaming providers and DVD rental outlets and more broadly against other sources of entertainment that our members could choose in their moments of free time.\nWe also compete against entertainment video providers in obtaining content that our members love, both for licensed streaming content and for original content\nprojects.\nWhile consumers may maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple entertainment sources, we strive for consumers to choose us in their moments of\nfree time. We have often referred to this choice as our objective of \"winning moments of truth.\" In attempting to win these moments of truth with our members, we\nare continually improving our service, including both our technology and our content, which is increasingly exclusive and curated, and includes our own original\nprogramming.\nSEASONALITY\nOur membership growth exhibits a seasonal pattern that reflects variations when consumers buy Internet-connected screens and when they tend to increase\ntheir viewing. Historically, the first and fourth quarters (October through March)represent our greatest membership growth across our Domestic and International\nstreaming segments and the fewest membership losses in our Domestic DVD segment.

We have also\nexpanded our streaming content offering to include more exclusive and original programming, including several Emmy, Golden Globe and Academy Award\nnominated original series and documentaries. Our original programming increasingly includes content that we produce.\n \nBUSINESS SEGMENTS\nThe Company has three reportable segments: Domestic streaming, International streaming and Domestic DVD. The Domestic streaming segment derives\nrevenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of streaming content to our members in the United States. The International streaming\nsegment derives revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of streaming content to our members outside the United States.

We compete against other entertainment video providers, such as\nmultichannel video programming distributors (\"MVPDs\"), Internet-based movie and TV content providers (including those that provide pirated content), video\ngaming providers and DVD rental outlets and more broadly against other sources of entertainment that our members could choose in their moments of free time.\nWe also compete against entertainment video providers in obtaining content that our members love, both for licensed streaming content and for original content\nprojects.\nWhile consumers may maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple entertainment sources, we strive for consumers to choose us in their moments of\nfree time. We have often referred to this choice as our objective of \"winning moments of truth.\" In attempting to win these moments of truth with our members, we\nare continually improving our service, including both our technology and our content, which is increasingly exclusive and curated, and includes our own original\nprogramming.\nSEASONALITY\nOur membership growth exhibits a seasonal pattern that reflects variations when consumers buy Internet-connected screens and when they tend to increase\ntheir viewing.

In July 2011, we separated the combined plans, making it necessary for members who wish to receive both DVDs-by-mail and streaming\ncontent to have two separate membership plans. Prior to these changes to our pricing and plan structure in 2011, we did not separately track streaming\nmemberships.\n(1)\nA membership (also referred to as a subscription or a member) is defined as the right to receive the Netflix service following sign-up and a method of\npayment being provided. Memberships are assigned to territories based on the geographic location used at time of sign-up as determined by our internal\nsystems, which utilize industry standard geo-location technology. We offer free-trial memberships to new and certain rejoining members. Total members\ninclude those who are on a free-trial as long as a method of payment has been provided.

The increases in\ncash in the year ended December 31, 2015 associated with the issuance of debt was partially offset by cash outflows from operations and investing activities.

See Note 5 of Item\n8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information.\nOur primary uses of cash include the acquisition, licensing and production of content, streaming delivery, marketing programs and payroll.

Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with\nthe policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nIn our opinion, Netflix, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on the COSO\ncriteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of\nNetflix, Inc. as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows\nfor each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015 of Netflix, Inc. and our report dated January 28, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nSan Jose, California\nJanuary 28, 2016\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\n32\n\n\nTable of Contents\nItem 9B.\nOther Information\nNone.\n33\n\n\nTable of Contents\nPART III\n \nItem 10.\nDirectors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance\nInformation regarding our directors and executive officers is incorporated by reference from the information contained under the sections “Proposal One:\nElection of Directors,” “Section",

The number of authorized shares as reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets was not affected by the stock split and accordingly has not been adjusted.\nSee Note 8 for additional information.\nAccounting Guidance Adopted in 2015\nIn April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2015-05, Customer's Accounting for Fees\nPaid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement, which provides guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. If a\ncloud computing arrangement includes a software license, the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the\nacquisition of other software licenses. If the arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for a cloud computing arrangement as a\nservice contract. The Company elected to early adopt the ASU in the third quarter of 2015 and has applied the guidance prospectively to all arrangements. The\nimpact of the adoption of the ASU was not material to the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs which changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in\nfinancial statements. ASU 2015-03 requires an entity to present such costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an\nasset. Amortization of the costs will continue to be reported as interest expense. The Company elected to early adopt ASU 2015-03 as of December 31, 2015, and\nretrospectively reclassifed $14.2 million of debt issuance costs associated with the Company's long-term debt as of December 31, 2014 from other non-current\nassets to long-term debt.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes.\nThe amendments in this update require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position.

The years 2008\nthrough 2014, remain subject to examination by the state of California. As a result of the above audit settlements, the Company has reassessed the tax reserves on\nthe related uncertain tax position for all open years and released $13.4 million of tax reserves in the fourth quarter of 2015. The Company has no significant foreign\njurisdiction audits underway. The years 2011 through 2014 remain subject to examination by foreign jurisdictions.\nGiven the potential outcome of the current examinations as well as the impact of the current examinations on the potential expiration of the statute of\nlimitations, it is reasonably possible that the balance of unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change within the next twelve months. However, an estimate\nof the range of reasonably possible adjustments cannot be made.\n11.\nEmployee Benefit Plan\nThe Company maintains a 401(k) savings plan covering substantially all of its employees.
