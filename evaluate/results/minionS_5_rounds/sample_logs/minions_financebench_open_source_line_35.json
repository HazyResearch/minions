  "question": "What drove operating margin change as of the FY22 for AMD? If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then please state that and explain why.",
  "predicted_answer": "The operating margin change for AMD in FY22 was primarily driven by a 44% revenue growth, with significant contributions from the Data Center, Gaming, and Embedded segments. However, this was offset by increased costs of goods sold due to the amortization of intangible assets from the Xilinx acquisition and higher operating expenses related to acquisition costs and increased headcount.",
  "ground_truth": [
    "The decrease in AMD's operating income was primarily driven by amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition"

  "correctness_reasoning": "The predicted answer correctly identifies the amortization of intangible assets from the Xilinx acquisition as a factor affecting AMD's operating margin, which aligns with the ground truth. It also provides additional context about revenue growth and other cost factors, which does not contradict the ground truth but rather adds depth to the explanation."
