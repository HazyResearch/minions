Yes, the product/service categories that represent more than 20% of Boeing's revenue for FY2022 are Commercial Airplanes, Defense, Space & Security, and Global Services.

["Yes. Boeing has product and service categories that represent more than 20% of Boeing's revenue for FY2022. These categories are Commercial Airplanes which comprises 39% of total revenue, Defence which comprises 35% of total revenue and Services which comprises 26% of total revenue."]

--- Correctness Evaluation ---
Is correct: True
Confidence: 0.90
Reasoning: The predicted answer correctly identifies that there are product/service categories representing more than 20% of Boeing's revenue for FY2022. It mentions Commercial Airplanes, Defense, and Global Services, which align with the ground truth categories of Commercial Airplanes, Defence, and Services. The inclusion of 'Space & Security' is a minor discrepancy but does not affect the correctness of the main conclusion that there are categories exceeding 20% of revenue.
