    "Yes, the margins have been consistent, there has been a minor decline of 1.1% in gross margins between FY2022 and FY2023."

  "correctness_reasoning": "The predicted answer states that there was a significant decline in gross margins from 2022 to 2023, exceeding the 2% fluctuation threshold, which contradicts the ground truth answer that mentions only a minor decline of 1.1%. The stance on the consistency of gross margins does not match, as the ground truth indicates consistency while the predicted answer suggests significant fluctuation."
