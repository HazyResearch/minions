--- Question ---
Does AMEX have an improving operating margin profile as of 2022? If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
AMEX's operating margin figures for 2022 are inconsistent, ranging from 14.8% to 95.8%, indicating no clear trend of improvement. Furthermore, the document suggests that operating margin may not be a useful metric for AMEX due to the company's focus on alternative metrics like credit risk management, net interest margin, and regulatory capital ratios, which better capture the complexities of its financial health.
