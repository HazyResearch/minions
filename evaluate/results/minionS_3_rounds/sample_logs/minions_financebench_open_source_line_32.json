  "correctness_reasoning": "The predicted quick ratio of 1.90 is outside the 10% tolerance range of the ground truth quick ratio of 1.57 (acceptable range: 1.413 to 1.727). Therefore, the numerical aspect of the predicted answer is incorrect, even though the overall conclusion about AMD's liquidity profile being reasonably healthy matches the ground truth."
