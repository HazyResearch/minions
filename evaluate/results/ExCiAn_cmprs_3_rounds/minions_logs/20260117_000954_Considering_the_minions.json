Define working capital ratio as total current assets divided by total current liabilities. Round your answer to two decimal places.\n\n---\n\nPlease provide succinct advice on the critical information we need to extract from the Financial document. Total length: 381486 characters to answer this question. \n\nAlso consider the following constraints:\n- In your response do NOT use numbered lists.\n- Do NOT structure your response as a sequence of steps.\n",
      "output": "To determine Block's FY2016 working capital ratio from the financial document, focus on extracting the total current assets and total current liabilities from the balance sheet for the fiscal year 2016. The working capital ratio is calculated by dividing total current assets by total current liabilities. Ensure that the figures you extract are specifically labeled as \"current\" to distinguish them from non-current or long-term assets and liabilities. Once you have these figures, perform the division and round the result to two decimal places to obtain the working capital ratio."

      "prompt": "# Decomposition Round #1\n\nYou (the supervisor) cannot directly read the document(s). Instead, you can assign small, isolated tasks to a less capable worker model that sees only a single chunk of text at a time. Any cross-chunk or multi-document reasoning must be handled by you.\n\n## Your Job: Write Two Python Functions\n\n### FUNCTION #1: `prepare_jobs(context, prev_job_manifests, prev_job_outputs) -> List[JobManifest]`\n- Break the document(s) into chunks (using the provided chunking function, if needed). Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 12 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`. All **multi-chunk integration** or **global reasoning** is your responsibility here.\n- Return one **aggregated string** suitable for further supervisor inspection.\n\n\n\n## Relevant Pydantic Models\n\nThe following models are already in the global scope. **Do NOT redefine or re-import them.**\n\n### JobManifest Model\n```\nclass JobManifest(BaseModel):\n    chunk: str  # the actual text for the chunk of the document\n    task: str  # the actual task instruction for the small model\n    advice: str  # optional, any additional advice on how to perform the task\n\n    chunk_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    task_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    job_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n\n```\n\n### JobOutput Model\n```\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    citation: Optional[str]\n    answer: Optional[str]\n\n```\n\n## Function Signatures\n```\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        context (List[str]): A list of documents.

Our actual results may differ materially\nfrom those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nWe started Square in February 2009 to enable businesses (sellers) to accept card payments, an important capability that was previously inaccessible to\nmany businesses. However, sellers also need innovative solutions to thrive, and we have since expanded to provide additional products and services to provide\nthese businesses with access to the same tools as large businesses. Square is a cohesive commerce ecosystem that combines sophisticated software with affordable\nhardware to enable sellers to turn mobile devices and computing devices into powerful payments and point-of-sale solutions. We focus on technology and design to\ncreate products and services that are cohesive, fast, self-serve, and dependable.\nThe foundation of our ecosystem is a full service, managed payments offering. With our offering, a seller can accept payments in person via magnetic\nstripe  (a swipe),  EMV (Europay, MasterCard,  and  Visa) (a dip), or NFC (Near Field Communication)  (a tap);  or online via Square  Invoices,  Square Virtual\nTerminal, or the seller’s website. Once on our system, sellers gain access to technology and features such as reporting and analytics, next-day settlements, digital\nreceipts, payment dispute management and chargeback protection, and PCI compliance. On the consumer (buyer) side, Square Cash offers individuals access to a\nfast, easy way to send and receive money electronically to and from individuals and businesses. We monetize these features through a per transaction fee which we\nrecord  as  revenue  upon  authorization  of  a  transaction  by  the  seller's  customer's  bank.  We  recognize  revenue  net  of  refunds,  which  arise  from  reversals  of\ntransactions initiated by sellers.\nOur commerce ecosystem also includes powerful point-of-sale software and services that help sellers make informed business decisions through the use\nof analytics and reporting. As a result, sellers can manage orders, inventory, locations, employees, and payroll; engage and grow their sales with customers; and\ngain access to business loans. Some of these advanced point-of-sale features are broadly applicable to our seller base and include Employee Management, and\nCustomer Engagement. We monetize these features through either a per transaction fee, a subscription fee, or a service fee.\nWith Square Capital, we facilitate the offering of loans to sellers based on their payment processing history, and the product is broadly applicable across\nour seller base. We recognize revenue upon the sale of ",

      "output": "### Analysis\n\n1. **Information Gathered:**\n   - We have multiple figures for total current assets for FY2016: $1,197,093, $534,062, $1,001,425, $234,166, $87,344, $56,331, and $700,343.\n   - We have multiple figures for total current liabilities for FY2016: $276.7 million, $35,410, $18.1 million, $577,464, and $73,623.\n\n2. **Sufficiency of Information:**\n   - The information is not sufficient to answer the question due to conflicting figures for both current assets and current liabilities. The discrepancies in the figures make it impossible to accurately calculate the working capital ratio.\n\n3. **Missing Information:**\n   - We need a consistent and reliable source or citation for both the total current assets and total current liabilities for FY2016. The figures should be explicitly labeled and ideally come from a consolidated balance sheet or a similar authoritative section of the financial document.\n\n4. **Calculation of the Working Capital Ratio:**\n   - If we had consistent figures, the working capital ratio would be calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Working Capital Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Current Assets}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}}\n     \\]\n   - The result would then be rounded to two decimal places.\n\n5. **Conflicting Answers:**\n   - For current assets, the figure $1,001,425 is cited as \"Total current assets\" in one of the outputs, which seems more reliable than others that are inferred or calculated from components.\n   - For current liabilities, the figure $577,464 is directly cited as \"Total current liabilities,\" which provides a clear and direct reference.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTo proceed, we should verify the figures $1,001,425 for total current assets and $577,464 for total current liabilities from the original document or a reliable source. If these figures are confirmed, we can calculate the working capital ratio as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Working Capital Ratio} = \\frac{1,001,425}{577,464} \\approx 1.73\n\\]\n\nThis would be the working capital ratio for Block's FY2016, rounded to two decimal places."
