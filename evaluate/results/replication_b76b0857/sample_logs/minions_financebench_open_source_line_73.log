--- Question ---
How much has the effective tax rate of Corning changed between FY2021 and FY2022?

--- Predicted Answer ---
The change in Corning's effective tax rate between FY2021 and FY2022 cannot be accurately determined due to conflicting data. The most frequently mentioned rates are 20.2% for FY2021 and 22.9% (GAAP) for FY2022, suggesting a potential increase, but this is not definitive.

--- Ground Truth ---
['The effective tax rate of Corning has changed from 20% in FY2021 to 23% in FY 2022.']

--- Correctness Evaluation ---
Is correct: False
Confidence: 0.70
Reasoning: The predicted answer does not provide a definitive change in the effective tax rate, whereas the ground truth specifies a change from 20% to 23%. The predicted answer suggests a potential increase but does not confirm it, and the rates mentioned (20.2% and 22.9%) do not align with the ground truth. Therefore, the predicted answer does not meet the criteria for correctness.
