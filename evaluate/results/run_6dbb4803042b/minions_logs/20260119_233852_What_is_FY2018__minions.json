      "output": "To determine Walmart's FY2018 days payable outstanding (DPO), focus on extracting specific financial data from the document. You need the average accounts payable for FY2017 and FY2018, which can be found in the statement of financial position. Look for the accounts payable figures at the end of FY2017 and FY2018, then calculate the average of these two numbers. Next, identify the cost of goods sold (COGS) for FY2018 from the profit and loss (P&L) statement. Additionally, find the inventory levels at the end of FY2017 and FY2018 to calculate the change in inventory. With these figures, you can compute the DPO using the formula provided. Ensure all values are accurate and round the final DPO to two decimal places."

Instead, you can assign small, isolated tasks to a less capable worker model that sees only a single chunk of text at a time. Any cross-chunk or multi-document reasoning must be handled by you.\n\n## Your Job: Write Two Python Functions\n\n### FUNCTION #1: `prepare_jobs(context, prev_job_manifests, prev_job_outputs) -> List[JobManifest]`\n- Break the document(s) into chunks (using the provided chunking function, if needed). Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 12 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`. All **multi-chunk integration** or **global reasoning** is your responsibility here.\n- Return one **aggregated string** suitable for further supervisor inspection.\n\n\n\n## Relevant Pydantic Models\n\nThe following models are already in the global scope. **Do NOT redefine or re-import them.**\n\n### JobManifest Model\n```\nclass JobManifest(BaseModel):\n    chunk: str  # the actual text for the chunk of the document\n    task: str  # the actual task instruction for the small model\n    advice: str  # optional, any additional advice on how to perform the task\n\n    chunk_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    task_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    job_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n\n```\n\n### JobOutput Model\n```\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    citation: Optional[str]\n    answer: Optional[str]\n\n```\n\n## Function Signatures\n```\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        context (List[str]): A list of documents.

Walmart U.S. generated approximately 64% of our net sales in fiscal 2018 , and of our three segments, Walmart U.S. is the largest and has\nhistorically had the highest gross profit as a percentage of net sales (\"gross profit rate\"). In addition, Walmart U.S. has historically contributed the greatest amount\nto the Company's net sales and operating income.\nWalmart International consists of operations in 27 countries outside of the U.S. and is divided into three major categories: retail, wholesale and other. These\ncategories consist of many formats, including: supercenters, supermarkets, hypermarkets, warehouse clubs (including Sam's Clubs) and cash & carry, as well as\neCommerce. Walmart International generated\n7\n\n\napproximately 24% of our fiscal 2018 net sales. The overall gross profit rate for Walmart International is lower than that of Walmart U.S. primarily because of its\nmerchandise mix. Walmart International is our second largest segment.\nSam's Club consists of membership-only warehouse clubs and operates in 44 states in the U.S. and in Puerto Rico, as well as eCommerce. Sam's Club accounted\nfor approximately 12% of our fiscal 2018 net sales. As a membership-only warehouse club, membership income is a significant component of the segment's\noperating income. Sam's Club operates with a lower gross profit rate and lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales than our other segments.\nThe Company measures the results of its segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain corporate\noverhead allocations. From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations, as\ndetermined by the information regularly reviewed by our CODM. When the measurement of a segment changes, previous period amounts and balances are\nreclassified to be comparable to the current period's presentation.\nWalmart U.S. Segment\nThe Walmart U.S. segment is a mass merchandiser of consumer products, operating under the \"Walmart,\" \"Wal-Mart\" and \"Walmart Neighborhood Market\"\nbrands, as well as walmart.com and other eCommerce brands. The Walmart U.S. segment had net sales of $318.5 billion , $307",

We have registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of U.S. and international\ndomain names, trademarks, service marks and copyrights. Additionally, we have filed U.S. and international patent applications covering certain of our proprietary\ntechnology. We have licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights to third parties.\nSuppliers and Supply Chain\nAs a retailer and warehouse club operator, we utilize a global supply chain that includes over 100,000 suppliers located around the world, including in the United\nStates, from whom we purchase the merchandise that we sell in our stores, clubs and online. In many instances, we purchase merchandise from producers located\nnear the stores and clubs in which such merchandise will be sold, particularly products in the \"fresh\" category. Our purchases may represent a significant\npercentage of a number of our suppliers' annual sales, and the volume of product we acquire from many suppliers allows us to obtain favorable pricing from such\nsuppliers. Our suppliers are subject to standards of conduct, including requirements that they comply with local labor laws, local worker safety laws and other\napplicable laws. Our ability to acquire from our suppliers the assortment and volume of products we wish to offer to our customer, to receive those products within\nthe required time through our supply chain and to distribute those products to our stores and clubs determines, in part, our in-stock levels in our stores and clubs\nand the attractiveness of our merchandise assortment we offer to our customers and members.\nEmployees\nAs of the end of fiscal 2018 , Walmart Inc. and our subsidiaries employed approximately 2.3 million employees (\"associates\") worldwide, with 1.5 million\nassociates in the U.S. and 0.8 million associates internationally. Similar to other retailers, the Company has a large number of part-time, hourly or non-exempt\nassociates. We believe our relationships with our associates are good and are continuing to improve. A large number of associates turn over each year, although\nWalmart U.S. turnover has been improving in fiscal 2018 as a result of our focus on increasing wages and providing improved tools, technology and training to\nassociates.\n14\n\n\nCertain information relating to retirement-related benefits we provide to our associates is included in Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn addition to retirement-related benefits, in the U.S., we offer a broad ra",

When we must acquire the currency to pay for such products and the exchange rates for the payment currency fluctuate in a manner unfavorable\nto us, our cost of sales may increase and we may be unable or unwilling to change the prices at which we sell those goods to address that increase in our costs, with\na corresponding adverse effect on our gross profit. Consequently, fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations.\nFailure to meet market expectations for our financial performance could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock.\nWe believe that the price of our stock generally reflects high market expectations for our future operating results. Any failure to meet or delay in meeting these\nexpectations, including our comparable store and club sales growth rates, eCommerce growth\n22\n\n\nrates, gross margin, or earnings and earnings per share could cause the market price of our stock to decline, as could changes in our dividend or stock repurchase\nprograms or policies. Additionally, failure of Walmart's performance to match that of other retailers may have a negative effect on the price of our stock.\nLegal, Tax, Regulatory, Compliance, Reputational and Other Risks\nOur operations subject us to legislative, judicial, accounting, legal, regulatory, tax, political and economic risks and conditions specific to the countries or\nregions in which we operate, which could materially adversely affect our business or financial performance.\nIn addition to our U.S. operations, we operate our retail business principally through wholly-owned subsidiaries in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, India,\nJapan and the United Kingdom and our maj",

CERTAIN OTHER PROCEEDINGS: The Company is a defendant in several lawsuits in which the complaints closely track the allegations set forth in a\nnews story that appeared in The New York Times ( the \" Times \" ) on April 21, 2012. One of these is a securities lawsuit that was filed on May 7, 2012, in the United\nStates District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, and subsequently transferred to the Western District of Arkansas, in which the plaintiff alleges various\nviolations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \"FCPA\") beginning in 2005, and asserts violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange\nAct of 1934, as amended, relating to certain prior disclosures of the Company. The plaintiff seeks to represent a class of shareholders who purchased or acquired\nstock of the Company between December 8, 2011, and April 20, 2012, and seeks damages and other relief based on allegations that the defendants' conduct\naffected the value of such stock. On September 20, 2016, the court granted plaintiff's motion for class certification. On October 6, 2016, the defendants filed a\npetition to appeal the class certification ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. On November 7, 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth\nCircuit denied the Company's petition.\nIn addition, a number of derivative complaints have been filed in Delaware and Arkansas, also tracking the allegations of the Times story, and naming various\ncurrent and former directors and certain former officers as additional defendants. The plaintiffs in the derivative suits (in which the Company is a nominal\ndefendant) allege, among other things, that the defendants who are or were directors or officers of the Company breached their fiduciary duties in connection with\ntheir oversight of FCPA compliance. All of the derivative suits have been combined into two consolidated proceedings, one of which was consolidated\n29\n\n\nin the United States District Court for the Western District of Arkansas and the other in the Delaware Court of Chancery. On March 31, 2015, the Western District\nof Arkansas granted the defendants' motion to dismiss the consolidated derivative proceedings in that court.

We reduced the number of new store and club openings in fiscal 2018 and the negative impact on comparable sales as a result of these openings\nwas not significant. We expect this trend to continue in the future as well. In fiscal 2017 , we estimate the negative impact on comparable sales as a result of\nopening new stores and clubs was approximately 0.7%. Our estimate was calculated primarily by comparing the sales trends of the impacted stores and clubs,\nwhich are identified based on their proximity to the new stores and clubs, to those of nearby non-impacted stores and clubs, in each case, as measured after the new\nstores and clubs are opened.\nOperating Discipline\nWe operate with discipline by managing expenses and optimizing the efficiency of how we work. We measure operating discipline through expense leverage,\nwhich we define as net sales growing at a faster rate than operating expenses.\nFiscal Years Ended January 31,\n(Amounts in millions, except unit counts)\n2018\n2017\nNet sales\n$\n495,761\n$\n481,317\nPercentage change from comparable period\n3.0%\n0.6%\nOperating, selling, general and administrative expenses\n$\n106,510\n$\n101,853\nPercentage change from comparable period\n4.6%\n5.0%\nOperating, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales\n21.5%\n21.2%\nFor fiscal 2018 , operating, selling, general and administrative (\"operating\") expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 32 basis points, when compared to the\nsame period in the previous fiscal year. While our increase in net sales and improving expense management had a positive impact on our operating expenses as a\npercentage of net sales, we did not leverage expenses as a result of approximately $0.6 billion of charges related to Sam's Club closures and discontinued real estate\nprojects, approximately $400 million related to a lump sum bonus paid to associates, $300 million related to Home Office severance, a legal accrual of $283\nmillion related to the FCPA matter, a charge of $244 million related to Walmart U.S. discontinued real estate projects, and the decisions to exit certain international\nproperties and wind down the first party Brazil eCommerce operations.\nStrategic Capital Allocation\nWe are allocating more capital to remodels, eCommerce, technology and supply chain and less to new store and club openings, when compared to prior years.

Management believes, however, that free cash flow, which measures our ability to generate additional\ncash from our business operations, is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the Company's financial performance. Free cash flow should be\nconsidered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a\nmeasure of our liquidity. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for discussions of GAAP metrics including net cash provided by operating activities, net cash used in\ninvesting activities and net cash used in financing activities.\nWe define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period. We had net cash\nprovided by operating activities of $28.3 billion , $31.7 billion and $27.6 billion for fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. We generated free cash flow of\n$18.3 billion , $21.1 billion and $16.1 billion for fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The decreases in net cash provided by operating activities and free cash\nflow in fiscal 2018 from fiscal 2017 were primarily due to the timing of tax and other payments, as well as lapping the previous year's improvements in working\ncapital management and the benefit from the application of tax regulations adopted in fiscal 2017. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities and free\ncash flow in fiscal 2017 from fiscal 2016 was primarily due to improved working capital management. Additionally, we benefited from the application of new tax\nregulations related to the accelerated deduction of remodels and related expenses.\nWalmart's definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the\nmeasure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, we\nbelieve it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows .\n38\n\n\nAlthough other companies report their free cash flow, numerous methods may exist for calculating a company's free cash flow. As a result, the method used by\nWalmart's management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net cash provided by operating activities, which we believe to\nbe the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow, as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used\nin financing activities:\n \nFiscal Years Ended January 31,\n(Amounts in millions)\n2018\n2017\n2016\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n28",

See Liquidity and Capital Resources for discussions of GAAP metrics including net cash provided by operating activities, net cash used in\ninvesting activities and net cash used in financing activities.\nWe define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period.

Additionally, we benefited from the application of new tax\nregulations related to the accelerated deduction of remodels and related expenses.\nWalmart's definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the\nmeasure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions.

The Company subsequently sold\nYihaodian to JD in fiscal 2017.\nCapital Resources\nWe believe cash flows from operations, our current cash position and access to capital markets will continue to be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash\nneeds, which include funding seasonal buildups in merchandise inventories and funding our capital expenditures, dividend payments and share repurchases.\nWe have strong commercial paper and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at\nfavorable rates in capital markets.

Following is a\nsummary of our critical accounting estimates and how they are applied in preparation of the financial statements.\nInventories\nWe value inventories at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, using the last-in, first-out (\"LIFO\")\nmethod for Walmart U.S. segment's inventories. The inventory at the Walmart International segment is valued primarily by the retail inventory method of\naccounting, using the first-in, first-out (\"FIFO\") method. The retail inventory method of accounting results in inventory being valued at the lower of cost or market,\nsince permanent markdowns are immediately recorded as a reduction of the retail value of inventory. The inventory at the Sam's Club segment is valued using the\nweighted-average cost LIFO method.\nUnder the retail method of accounting, inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market, which is determined by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to each merchandise\ngrouping's retail value. The FIFO cost-to-retail ratio is generally based on the fiscal year purchase activity. The cost-to-retail ratio for measuring any LIFO\nprovision is based on the initial margin of the fiscal year purchase activity less the impact of any permanent markdowns. The retail method of a",

Judgments made include recording markdowns used to sell inventory and shrinkage. When management determines the ability to sell inventory has\ndiminished, markdowns for clearance activity and the related cost impact are recorded. Factors considered in the determination of markdowns include current and\nanticipated demand, customer preferences and age of merchandise, as well as seasonal and fashion trends. Changes in weather and customer preferences could also\ncause changes in the amount and timing of markdowns from year to year.\nWhen necessary, we record a LIFO provision for the estimated annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end.\nOur LIFO provision is calculated based on inventory levels, markup rates and internally generated retail price indices. As a measure of sensitivity, a 1% increase to\nour retail price indices would not have resulted in a decrease to the carrying value of inventory. At January 31, 2018 and 2017 , our inventories valued at LIFO\napproximated those inventories as if they were valued at FIFO.\nWe provide for estimated inventory losses, or shrinkage, between physical inventory counts on the basis of a historical percentage of sales.

The effect of a change in a particular assumption is calculated without adjusting any other assumption. In reality,\nhowever, a change in one factor could cause a change in another, which may magnify or negate other sensitivities.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our short-term borrowings and long-term debt issuances. We hedge a portion of our interest rate risk by\nmanaging the mix of fixed and variable rate debt and by entering into interest rate swaps. For fiscal 2018 , the net fair value of our interest rate swaps decreased\napproximately  $87 million primarily due to fluctuations in market interest rates.\nThe table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For debt obligations, the table represents the\nprincipal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates.

If management determines, after performing an assessment\nbased on the qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, or that a fair value of the reporting unit\nsubstantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured, then a quantitative goodwill impairment test would be required. The quantitative test for goodwill\nimpairment is performed by determining the fair value of the related reporting units. Fair value is measured based on the discounted cash flow method and relative\nmarket-based approaches. After evaluation, management determined the fair value of each reporting unit is greater than the carrying amount and, accordingly, the\nCompany has not recorded any impairment charges related to goodwill.\nThe following table reflects goodwill activity, by reportable segment, for fiscal 2018 and 2017 :\n(Amounts in millions)\nWalmart U.S.\nWalmart\nInternational\nSam's Club\nTotal\nBalances as of February 1, 2016\n$\n461\n$\n15,921\n$\n313\n$\n16,695\nChanges in currency translation and other\n—\n(1,433)\n—\n(1,433)\nAcquisitions (1)\n1,775\n—\n—\n1,775\nBalances as of January 31, 2017\n2,236\n14,488\n313\n17,037\nChanges in currency translation and other\n—\n996\n—\n996\nAcquisitions\n209\n—\n—\n209\nBalances as of January 31, 2018\n$\n2,445\n$\n15,484\n$\n313\n$\n18,242\n(1)\nGoodwill recorded for fiscal 2017 Walmart U.S. acquisitions primarily relates to Jet.com, Inc.

As of January 31, 2018 and 2017 , the notional\namounts and fair values of these derivatives were as follows:\n \nJanuary 31, 2018\nJanuary 31, 2017\n(Amounts in millions)\nNotional Amount\nFair Value\nNotional Amount\nFair Value\nReceive fixed-rate, pay variable-rate interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges\n$\n4,000\n$\n(91)\n$\n5,000\n$\n(4)\nReceive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross-currency swaps designated as net investment hedges\n2,250\n208\n2,250\n471\nReceive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross-currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges\n4,523\n205\n3,957\n(618)\nTotal\n$\n10,773\n$\n322\n$\n11,207\n$\n(151)\nAdditionally, the Company's available-for-sale securities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis using Level 1 inputs. Changes in fair value are recorded in\naccumulated other comprehensive loss. The cost basis and fair value of the Company's available-for-sale securities as of January 31, 2018 and 2017 , are as\nfollows:\n \nJanuary 31, 2018\nJanuary 31, 2017\n(Amounts in millions)\nCost Basis\nFair Value\nCost Basis\nFair Value\nAvailable-for-sale securities\n$\n1,901\n$\n3,547\n$\n1,901\n$\n2,046\nNonrecurring Fair Value Measurements\nIn addition to assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company's assets and liabilities are also subject to nonrecurring fair value\nmeasurements. Generally, assets are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as a result of impairment charges. Fiscal 2018 impairment charges to assets\nmeasured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis were $1.4 billion and primarily related to restructuring activities described in Note 14 , as well as discontinued real\nestate projects in the U.S. and decisions to exit certain international properties . These impairment charges were classified in operating, selling, general and\nadministrative expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Income. The fair value was determined based on comparable market values of similar\nproperties or on a rental income approach, using Level 2 inputs. Impairment charges not related to restructuring or decisions to exit properties for fiscal 2018 were\nnot material. Additionally, total impairment charges for fiscal 2017 were not material.\nOther Fair Value Disclosures\nThe Company records cash and cash equivalents and short-term borrowings at cost. The carrying values of these instruments approximate their fair value due to\ntheir short-term maturities.\nThe Company's long-term debt is also recorded at cost. The fair value is estimated using Level 2 inputs based on the Company's current incremental borrowing rate\nfo",

It is impractical to segregate and identify revenues for each of these individual products and services.\nThe Walmart U.S. segment includes the Company's mass merchant concept in the U.S. operating under the \"Walmart\" or \"Wal-Mart\" brands, as well as\neCommerce. The Walmart International segment consists of the Company's operations outside of the U.S., including eCommerce. The Sam's Club segment\nincludes the warehouse membership clubs in the U.S., as well as samsclub.com.

Foreign property, including shares of stock (i.e., Shares) and other rights to receive\nShares ( e.g. , PRSUs) of a non-Canadian company held by a Canadian resident employee must generally be reported annually on a\nForm T1135 (Foreign Income Verification Statement), if the total cost of your specified foreign property exceeds C$100,000 at any\ntime during the year.

When Shares are acquired, their cost generally is the adjusted cost base\n(“ACB”) of the Shares. The ACB ordinarily is equal to the fair market value of the Shares at the time of acquisition, but if you own\nother Shares (acquired separately), this ACB may have to be averaged with the ACB of the other Shares.\nCHILE\nTerms and Conditions\nLabor Law Acknowledgement .
