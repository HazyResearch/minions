Give a solution to the question by using the income statement.\n\n---\n\nPlease provide succinct advice on the critical information we need to extract from the Financial document. Total length: 415169 characters to answer this question. \n\nAlso consider the following constraints:\n- In your response do NOT use numbered lists.\n- Do NOT structure your response as a sequence of steps.\n",
      "output": "To determine Adobe's year-over-year change in unadjusted operating income from FY2015 to FY2016, focus on extracting the operating income figures for both fiscal years from the income statement section of the financial document. Look for the line item labeled \"Operating Income\" or \"Income from Operations\" for FY2015 and FY2016. Once you have these figures, calculate the percentage change by subtracting the FY2015 operating income from the FY2016 operating income, dividing the result by the FY2015 operating income, and then multiplying by 100 to convert it to a percentage. Round the final result to one decimal place to meet the question's requirements."

      "prompt": "# Decomposition Round #1\n\nYou (the supervisor) cannot directly read the document(s). Instead, you can assign small, isolated tasks to a less capable worker model that sees only a single chunk of text at a time. Any cross-chunk or multi-document reasoning must be handled by you.\n\n## Your Job: Write Two Python Functions\n\n### FUNCTION #1: `prepare_jobs(context, prev_job_manifests, prev_job_outputs) -> List[JobManifest]`\n- Break the document(s) into chunks (using the provided chunking function, if needed). Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 12 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`. All **multi-chunk integration** or **global reasoning** is your responsibility here.\n- Return one **aggregated string** suitable for further supervisor inspection.\n\n\n\n## Relevant Pydantic Models\n\nThe following models are already in the global scope. **Do NOT redefine or re-import them.**\n\n### JobManifest Model\n```\nclass JobManifest(BaseModel):\n    chunk: str  # the actual text for the chunk of the document\n    task: str  # the actual task instruction for the small model\n    advice: str  # optional, any additional advice on how to perform the task\n\n    chunk_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    task_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    job_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n\n```\n\n### JobOutput Model\n```\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    citation: Optional[str]\n    answer: Optional[str]\n\n```\n\n## Function Signatures\n```\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        context (List[str]): A list of documents.

During fiscal 2015, we integrated Fotolia into our Digital Media reportable \nsegment. \nWe also completed other immaterial business acquisitions during the fiscal years presented.

The \ninitial purchase accounting for this transaction has not yet been completed given the short period of time between the acquisition \ndate and the issuance of these financial statements. TubeMogul will be integrated into our Digital Marketing  reportable segment \nfor financial reporting purposes in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.\nSee Note 2 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding these acquisitions. \nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nIn preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP and pursuant to the rules and regulations of \nthe SEC, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, \nand related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical \nexperience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially \nfrom these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On a regular basis, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and \nestimates. We also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\nWe believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition, business \ncombinations, goodwill impairment and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. \nThese areas are key components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules requiring us to make judgments and \nestimates, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policie",

Historically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates \nrelative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenue is derived from the subscription, non-software related hosted services, perpetual and term-based licensing of \nsoftware products, associated software maintenance and support plans, consulting services, training and technical support. Most \nof our enterprise customer arrangements are complex, involving multiple solutions and various license rights, bundled with post-\ncontract customer support and other meaningful rights that together provide a complete end-to-end solution to the customer. \nThroughout the contract period, customers use our solutions to complete various phases of the creative and/or marketing processes \nallowing them to concurrently work on multiple projects. In response to evolving customer and market expectations, we frequently \nexpand and improve our technology to keep up with the pace of change, to provide enhancements to our tools to meet industry \nneeds and to provide support at each stage of the customer’s life cycle.\nWe recognize revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement \nexists, we have delivered the product or performed the service, the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is probable. \nDetermining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have \na significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report. \nWe enter into multiple element revenue arrangements in which a customer may purchase a combination of software, upgrades, \nmaintenance and support, hosted services and consulting.\nFor our software and software-related multiple element arrangements, we must: (1) determine whether and when each \nelement has been delivered; (2) determine whether undelivered products or services are essential to the functionality of the delivered \nproducts and services; (3) determine the fair value of each undelivered element using vendor-specific objective evidence  (“VSOE”); \nand (4) allocate the total price among the various elements.

We determine \nthe selling price for each deliverable using VSOE of selling price, if it exists, or TPE of selling price. If neither VSOE nor TPE \nof selling price exist for a deliverable, we use BESP. Once revenue is allocated to software or software-related elements as a group, \nwe recognize revenue in conformance with software revenue accounting guidance. Revenue is recognized when revenue recognition \ncriteria are met for each element.\nWe are generally unable to establish VSOE or TPE for non-software elements and as such, we use BESP. BESP is generally \nused for offerings that are not typically sold on a stand-alone basis or for new or highly customized offerings. We determine BESP \nfor a product or service by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, major product groupings, geographies, market \nconditions, competitive landscape, internal costs, gross margin objectives and pricing practices. Pricing practices taken into \nconsideration include historic contractually stated prices, volume discounts where applicable and our price lists. We must estimate \ncertain royalty revenue amounts due to the timing of securing information from our customers.

These Creative Cloud offerings address the \nmultiple routes to market we use to license our creative software to targeted customers. Adoption of Creative Cloud has transformed \nour business model, and we continue to expect this to drive higher long-term revenue growth through an expansion of our customer \nbase by acquiring new users through a lower cost of entry and delivery of additional features and value, as well as keeping existing \ncustomers current on our latest release. We have also built out a marketplace for Creative Cloud subscribers to enable the delivery \nand purchase of stock content in our Adobe Stock service. Overall, our strategy with Creative Cloud is designed to enable us to \nincrease our revenue with users, attract more new customers, and grow a recurring and predictable revenue stream that is recognized \nratably.\nWe continue to implement strategies that will accelerate awareness, consideration and purchase of subscriptions to our \nCreative Cloud offerings. These strategies include increasing the value Creative Cloud users receive, such as offering new mobile \napplications, as well as targeted promotions and offers that attract past customers and potential users to try out and ultimately \nsubscribe to Creative Cloud. Because of the shift towards Creative Cloud subscriptions and Enterprise Term License Agreements \n(“ETLAs”), revenue from perpetual licensing of our Creative products is now immaterial to our business.\nWe are also a market leader with our Adobe Document Cloud offerings built around our Acrobat family of products, the \nAdobe Reader and a set of integrated cloud-based document services, including Adobe Sign.

Our cash and \ninvestments totaled $4.76 billion as of December 2, 2016. Of this amount, approximately 83% was held by our foreign subsidiaries \nand subject to material repatriation tax effects. Our intent is to permanently reinvest a significant portion of our earnings from \nforeign operations, and current plans do not anticipate that we will need funds generated from foreign operations to fund our \ndomestic operations. In the event funds from foreign operations are needed to fund operations in the United States and if U.S. tax \nhas not already been previously provided, we would provide for and pay additional U.S. taxes in connection with repatriating \nthese funds.\n\n\nTable of Contents\n55\nCash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to the risks detailed \nin Part I, Item 1A titled “Risk Factors.” However, based on our current business plan and revenue prospects, we believe that our \nexisting cash, cash equivalents and investment balances, our anticipated cash flows from operations and our available credit facility \nwill be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for the next twelve months. \nOn March 2, 2012, we entered into a five-year $1 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement (the “Credit \nAgreement”), providing for loans to us and certain of our subsidiaries. On March 1, 2013, we exercised our option under the Credit \nAgreement to extend the maturity date of the Credit Agreement by one year to March 2, 2018. On July 27, 2015, we entered into \nan amendment to further extend the maturity date of the Credit Agreement to July 27, 2020 and reallocated the facility among the \nsyndicate of lenders that are parties to the Credit Agreement. As of December 2, 2016, there were no outstanding borrowings under \nthis Credit Agreement and the entire $1 billion credit line remains available for borrowing. \nAs of December 2, 2016, the amount outstanding under our senior notes was $1.9 billion, consisting of $900 million of \n4.75% senior notes due February 1, 2020 (the “2020 Notes”) and $1 billion of 3.25% senior notes due February 1, 2025 (together \nwith the 2020 Notes, the “Notes”). \nSubsequent to December 2, 2016, we completed our acquisition of TubeMogul, a publicly held video advertising platform \ncompany, for approximately $549 million in cash consideration, as well as the assumption of certain employee equity awards.

External investment firms managed, on average, \n61% of our consolidated invested balances during fiscal 2016. \nStock Repurchase Program\nTo facilitate our stock repurchase program, designed to return value to our stockholders and minimize dilution from stock \nissuances, we may repurchase shares in the open market or enter into structured repurchase agreements with third parties. In the \nfirst quarter of fiscal 2015, the Board of Directors approved our stock repurchase program granting us authority to repurchase up \nto $2 billion in common stock through the end of fiscal 2017. \nDuring fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, we entered into several structured stock repurchase agreements with large financial \ninstitutions, whereupon we provided them with prepayments totaling $1.08 billion, $625 million and $600 million, respectively. \nThe prepayments of $1.08 billion made during fiscal 2016 were under the current $2 billion authority. Of the prepayments of $625 \nmillion made during fiscal 2015, $425 million were under the current $2 billion authority and $200 million were under the previous \n$2 billion authority.

We \nenter into these agreements in order to take advantage of repurchasing shares at a guaranteed discount to the Volume Weighted \nAverage Price (“VWAP”) of our common stock over a specified period of time. We only enter into such transactions when the \ndiscount that we receive is higher than the expected foregone return on our cash prepayments to the financial institutions. There \nwere no explicit commissions or fees on these structured repurchases. Under the terms of the agreements, there is no requirement \nfor the financial institutions to return any portion of the prepayment to us.\nThe financial institutions agree to deliver shares to us at monthly intervals during the contract term. The parameters used \nto calculate the number of shares deliverable are: the total notional amount of the contract, the number of trading days in the \ncontract, the number of trading days in the interval and the average VWAP of our stock during the interval less the agreed upon \ndiscount.

In June 2014, we entered into interest rate swaps that effectively converted the fixed interest rate on our 2020 Notes to a \nfloating interest rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a fixed number of basis points through February \n1, 2020.\nCovenants\nOur credit facility contains a financial covenant requiring us not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio. Our Almaden Tower \nlease includes certain financial ratios as defined in the lease agreement that are reported to the lessor quarterly.  As of December 2, \n2016, we were in compliance with all of our covenants.

We believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either certain \naudits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. Given the uncertainties \ndescribed above, we can only determine a range of estimated potential decreases in underlying unrecognized tax benefits ranging \nfrom $0 to approximately $10 million.  \nRoyalties\nWe have certain royalty commitments associated with the licensing of certain products. Royalty expense is generally based \non a dollar amount per unit, or a percentage of the underlying revenue.\nIndemnifications\nIn the normal course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers against claims of intellectual \nproperty infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and from time to time, we are subject to claims \nby our customers under these indemnification provisions.

Additionally, we hedge our net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities with foreign \nexchange forward contracts.

As of December 2, 2016, all contracts were set to expire at \nvarious dates through June 2017. The bank counterparties in these contracts could expose us to credit-related losses which would \nbe largely mitigated with collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value \nof these contracts fluctuates from contractually established thresholds.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nOperations\nFounded in 1982, Adobe Systems Incorporated is one of the largest and most diversified software companies in the world. \nWe offer a line of products and services used by creative professionals, marketers, knowledge workers, application developers, \nenterprises and consumers for creating, managing, delivering, measuring, optimizing and engaging with compelling content and \nexperiences across personal computers, devices and media. We market and license our products and services directly to enterprise \ncustomers through our sales force and to end users through app stores and our own website at www.adobe.com. We offer many \nof our products via a Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) model or a managed services model (both of which are referred to as a hosted \nor cloud-based model) as well as through term subscription and pay-per-use models. We also distribute certain products and services \nthrough a network of distributors, value-added resellers (“VARs”), systems integrators (“SIs”), independent software vendors \n(“ISVs”), retailers, software developers and original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”). In addition, we license our technology \nto hardware manufacturers, software developers and service providers for use in their products and solutions. Our products run \non personal and server-based computers, as well as on smartphones, tablets and other devices, depending on the product. We have \noperations in the Americas, Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) and Asia-Pacific (“APAC”). \nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include those of Adobe and its subsidiaries, after elimination of all \nintercompany accounts and transactions. We have prepared the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance \nwith accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and pursuant to the rules and regulations \nof the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).\nUse of Estimates\nIn preparing Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP and pursuant to the rules \nand regulations of the SEC, we must make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial \nStatements and accompanying notes. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, sales allowances and programs, bad debts, stock-\nbased compensation, determining the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities, excess inventory and purchase \ncommitments, restructuring charges, facilities lease losses, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, litigation, income taxes \nand investments. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates.\nFiscal Year\nOur fiscal year is a 52- or 53-week year that ends on the Friday closest to November ",

Most \nof our enterprise customer arrangements are complex, involving multiple solutions and various license rights, bundled with post-\ncontract customer support and other meaningful rights that together provide a complete end-to-end solution to the customer. \nWe recognize revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement \nexists, we have delivered the product or performed the service, the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is probable. \n\n\nTable of Contents\nADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED\n NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n67\nDetermining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have \na significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report. \nMultiple Element Arrangements\nWe enter into multiple element revenue arrangements in which a customer may purchase a combination of software, upgrades, \nmaintenance and support, hosted services, and consulting.\nFor our software and software-related multiple element arrangements, we must: (1) determine whether and when each \nelement has been delivered; (2) determine whether undelivered products or services are essential to the functionality of the delivered \nproducts and services; (3) determine the fair value of each undelivered element using vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”); \nand (4) allocate the total price among the various elements. VSOE of fair value is used to allocate a portion of the price to the \nundelivered elements and the residual method is used to allocate the remaining portion to the delivered elements. Absent VSOE, \nrevenue is deferred until the earlier of the point at which VSOE of fair value exists for any undelivered element or until all elements \nof the arrangement have been delivered. However, if the only undelivered element is maintenance and support, the entire \narrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period. Changes in assumptions or judgments or changes to the elements \nin a software arrangement could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period.\nWe determine VSOE for each element b",

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nOur stock-based compensation programs are long-term retention programs that are intended to attract, retain and provide \nincentives for employees, officers and directors, and to align stockholder and employee interests. We have the following stock-\nbased compensation plans and programs:\nRestricted Stock Unit Plan\nWe grant restricted stock units to eligible employees under our 2003 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended (“2003 Plan”). \nRestricted stock units granted as part of our annual review process vest annually over three years. Other restricted stock units \ngenerally vest over four years, the majority of which vest 25% annually. Certain grants have other vesting periods approved by \nour Board of Directors or an authorized committee.\nWe grant performance awards to officers and key employees under our 2003 Plan which cliff-vest after three years. \nAs of December 2, 2016, we had reserved 183.2 million shares of common stock for issuance under our 2003 Plan and had \n89.0 million shares available for grant.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nOur 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) allows eligible employee participants to purchase shares of our common \nstock at a discount through payroll deductions. The ESPP consists of a twenty-four month offering period with four six-month \npurchase periods in each offering period. Employees purchase shares in each purchase period at 85% of the market value of our \ncommon stock at either the beginning of the offering period or the end of the purchase period, whichever price is lower. The ESPP \nwill continue until the earlier of (i) termination by the Board or (ii) the date on which all of the shares available for issuance under \nthe plan have been issued.\nAs of December 2, 2016, we had reserved 93.0 million shares of our common stock for issuance under the ESPP and \napproximately 8.9 million shares remain available for future issuance.\nStock Option Plan\nThe 2003 Plan allows us to grant options to all employees, including executive officers, outside consultants and non-\nemployee directors. This plan will continue until the earlier of (i) termination by the Board or (ii) the date on which all of the \nshares available for issuance under the plan have been issued and restrictions on issued shares have lapsed. Option vesting periods \nused in the past were generally four years and expire seven years from the effective date of grant. \nWe eliminated the use of stock option grants for all employees effective fiscal 2012, and for all of the non-employee directors \neffective fiscal 2014, but may choose to issue stock options in the future.  \nPerformance Share Programs\nOur 2016, 2015 and 2014 Performance Share Programs aim to help focus key employees on building stockholder value, \nprovide significant award potential for achieving outstanding Company performance and enhance the abi",

If treasury stock is not available, common stock will be issued. In order to minimize the impact \nof on-going dilution from exercises of stock options and vesting of restricted stock units and performance shares, we instituted a \nstock repurchase program. See Note 12 for information regarding our stock repurchase programs.\nValuation of Stock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award. \nOur performance share awards are valued using a Monte Carlo Simulation model. The fair value of the awards are fixed at \ngrant date and amortized over the longer of the remaining performance or service period. \n We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of ESPP shares. The determination of the fair \nvalue of stock-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as \nassumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include our expected stock price volatility \nover the expected term of the awards, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, a risk-free interest rate and \nany expected dividends.\nThe expected term of ESPP shares is the average of the remaining purchase periods under each offering period.

We also have audited Adobe Systems \nIncorporated’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 2, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control \n- Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). \nAdobe Systems Incorporated’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective \ninternal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, \nincluded in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item \n9A. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal \ncontrol over financial reporting based on our audits.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United \nStates). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial \nstatements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all \nmaterial respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the \namounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by \nmanagement, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting \nincluded obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, \nand testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also \nincluded performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide \na reasonable basis for our opinions.\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the \nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally \naccepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that \n(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions \nof the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are record",

      "output": "From the collected outputs, we have identified two chunks that provide relevant information about Adobe's operating income for FY2015 and FY2016:\n\n1. **Chunk #54**: Reports operating income as $873,781 for FY2015 and $1,435,138 for FY2016.\n2. **Chunk #87**: Reports operating income as $903,095 for FY2015 and $1,493,602 for FY2016.\n\nThere is a discrepancy between the figures provided in these two chunks. To resolve this, we should rely on the citations provided:\n\n- **Chunk #54** provides a citation: \"Income before income taxes\\n$\\n1,435,138\\n$\\n873,781\\n$\\n361,376\\n$\\n356,141\\n$\\n1,118,794\".\n- **Chunk #87** provides a citation: \"Operating income\\n1,493,602\\n903,095\\n412,685\".\n\nThe citation from Chunk #87 explicitly mentions \"Operating income,\" which aligns with the task of finding operating income figures. Therefore, we should consider the figures from Chunk #87 as more reliable.\n\nWith the operating income figures from Chunk #87:\n- FY2015: $903,095\n- FY2016: $1,493,602\n\nTo calculate the year-over-year change in operating income:\n\\[ \\text{Percentage Change} = \\left(\\frac{\\text{FY2016 Income} - \\text{FY2015 Income}}{\\text{FY2015 Income}}\\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\\[ \\text{Percentage Change} = \\left(\\frac{1,493,602 - 903,095}{903,095}\\right) \\times 100 \\approx 65.4\\% \\]\n\nThus, the year-over-year change in unadjusted operating income from FY2015 to FY2016 is approximately 65.4%."
