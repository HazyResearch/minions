--- Question ---
Are Best Buy's gross margins historically consistent (not fluctuating more than roughly 2% each year)? If gross margins are not a relevant metric for a company like this, then please state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
Best Buy's gross margins are not historically consistent, as they have fluctuated by more than 2% in recent years.

--- Ground Truth ---
['Yes, the margins have been consistent, there has been a minor decline of 1.1% in gross margins between FY2022 and FY2023.']

--- Correctness Evaluation ---
Is correct: False
Confidence: 1.00
Reasoning: The predicted answer contradicts the ground truth answer. The ground truth states that Best Buy's gross margins have been consistent with only a minor decline of 1.1%, which is within the 2% fluctuation range. The predicted answer incorrectly states that the margins have fluctuated by more than 2% in recent years, which does not align with the ground truth.
