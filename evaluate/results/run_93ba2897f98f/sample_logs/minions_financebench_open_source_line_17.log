--- Question ---
Roughly how many times has AES Corporation sold its inventory in FY2022? Calculate inventory turnover ratio for the FY2022; if conventional inventory management is not meaningful for the company then state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
Conventional inventory management metrics, such as inventory turnover ratios, are not meaningful for AES Corporation due to its focus on energy production and distribution rather than managing physical inventory. The COGS for FY2022 is $10,069 million, but without average inventory data, an inventory turnover ratio cannot be calculated.

--- Ground Truth ---
['AES has converted inventory 9.5 times in FY 2022.']

--- Correctness Evaluation ---
Is correct: True
Confidence: 0.90
Reasoning: The predicted answer correctly identifies that conventional inventory management metrics, such as inventory turnover ratios, are not meaningful for AES Corporation due to its focus on energy production and distribution rather than managing physical inventory. This aligns with the context of the company, even though the ground truth provides a numerical turnover ratio. The predicted answer provides a valid explanation for why such a metric may not be applicable.
