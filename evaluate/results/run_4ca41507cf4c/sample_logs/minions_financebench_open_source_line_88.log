--- Question ---
Roughly how many times has JnJ sold its inventory in FY2022? Calculate inventory turnover ratio for FY2022; if conventional inventory management is not meaningful for the company then state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
The inventory turnover ratio for Johnson & Johnson in FY2022 cannot be calculated due to the absence of confirmed Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) data. The beginning inventory is $10,387 million, and the ending inventory is $12,483 million. Without COGS, the inventory turnover ratio remains indeterminable. There is no indication that conventional inventory management is not meaningful for the company.

--- Ground Truth ---
['JnJ sold its inventory 2.7 times in FY2022.']
