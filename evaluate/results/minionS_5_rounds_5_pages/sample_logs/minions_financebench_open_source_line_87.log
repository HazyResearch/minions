--- Question ---
What drove gross margin change as of FY2022 for JnJ? If gross margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then please state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
The gross margin change for Johnson & Johnson in FY2022 was driven by one-time COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing exit costs, currency impacts, commodity inflation, and supply chain benefits. These factors collectively influenced the company's cost structure and pricing strategies. While the gross margin is a relevant metric for J&J, specific data on the exact change in gross margin percentage is not available.

--- Ground Truth ---
['For FY22, JnJ had changes in gross margin due to: One-time COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing exit related costs, Currency impacts in the Pharmaceutical segment, Commodity inflation in the MedTech and Consumer Health segments, partially offset by Supply chain benefits in the Consumer Health segment.']

--- Correctness Evaluation ---

Confidence: 0.90
Reasoning: The predicted answer correctly identifies the key factors that drove the gross margin change for JnJ in FY2022, including one-time COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing exit costs, currency impacts, commodity inflation, and supply chain benefits. These align with the ground truth answer. The additional context about the relevance of gross margin as a metric does not contradict the ground truth and is acceptable.
