--- Question ---
Does AMEX have an improving operating margin profile as of 2022? If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
AMEX has an improving operating margin profile as of 2022, but operating margin may not be the most critical metric for evaluating its performance.

--- Ground Truth ---
['Performance is not measured through operating margin']

--- Correctness Evaluation ---
Is correct: False
Confidence: 0.80
Reasoning: The ground truth states that performance is not measured through operating margin, indicating that operating margin is not a useful metric for AMEX. The predicted answer suggests that AMEX has an improving operating margin profile, which contradicts the ground truth by implying that operating margin is relevant. Therefore, the key facts and conclusions do not align.
