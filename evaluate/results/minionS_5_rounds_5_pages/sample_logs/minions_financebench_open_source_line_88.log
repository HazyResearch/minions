--- Question ---
Roughly how many times has JnJ sold its inventory in FY2022? Calculate inventory turnover ratio for FY2022; if conventional inventory management is not meaningful for the company then state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
The inventory turnover ratio for Johnson & Johnson in FY2022 cannot be calculated due to the absence of confirmed Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) data. The beginning inventory is $10,387 million, and the ending inventory is $12,483 million. Without COGS, the inventory turnover ratio remains indeterminable. There is no indication that conventional inventory management is not meaningful for the company.

--- Ground Truth ---
['JnJ sold its inventory 2.7 times in FY2022.']

--- Correctness Evaluation ---
Is correct: False
Confidence: 0.80
Reasoning: The predicted answer states that the inventory turnover ratio cannot be calculated due to the absence of COGS data, while the ground truth provides a specific turnover ratio of 2.7 times. The predicted answer does not align with the ground truth, which indicates that the calculation is possible and provides a specific result.
