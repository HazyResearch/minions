  "question": "Roughly how many times has JnJ sold its inventory in FY2022? Calculate inventory turnover ratio for FY2022; if conventional inventory management is not meaningful for the company then state that and explain why.",
  "predicted_answer": "The inventory turnover ratio for Johnson & Johnson in FY2022 is approximately 2.72 times. Conventional inventory management may not be meaningful for the company due to its complex global supply chain and diverse product portfolio, which require tailored inventory management strategies.",
