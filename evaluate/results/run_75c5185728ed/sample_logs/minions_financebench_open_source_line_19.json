DPO is defined as: 365 * (average accounts payable between FY2016 and FY2017) / (FY2017 COGS + change in inventory between FY2016 and FY2017). Round your answer to two decimal places.

  "predicted_answer": "Amazon's FY2017 DPO is calculated as follows: DPO = 365 * (average accounts payable) / (COGS + change in inventory) = 365 * $16,242M / ($111,934M + $4,586M) = 365 * $16,242M / $116,520M = 50.85 days.",
