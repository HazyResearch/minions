Total length: 494686 characters.: \n\n## Question\nHas Verizon increased its debt on balance sheet between 2022 and the 2021 fiscal period?\n\n---\n\nPlease provide succinct advice on the critical information we need to extract from the Financial document. Total length: 494686 characters to answer this question. \n\nAlso consider the following constraints:\n- In your response do NOT use numbered lists.\n- Do NOT structure your response as a sequence of steps.\n",
      "output": "To determine whether Verizon increased its debt on the balance sheet between the 2022 and 2021 fiscal periods, focus on extracting specific financial data from the document. Look for the balance sheet sections for both fiscal years, specifically under liabilities where debt is typically reported. Key figures to identify include total debt, which may be broken down into short-term and long-term debt. Compare these figures between the two years to assess any increase. Additionally, review any notes or management discussion sections that might provide context or explanations for changes in debt levels. This information will help you ascertain whether there has been an increase in Verizon's debt from 2021 to 2022."

      "prompt": "# Decomposition Round #1\n\nYou (the supervisor) cannot directly read the document(s). Instead, you can assign small, isolated tasks to a less capable worker model that sees only a single chunk of text at a time. Any cross-chunk or multi-document reasoning must be handled by you.\n\n## Your Job: Write Two Python Functions\n\n### FUNCTION #1: `prepare_jobs(context, prev_job_manifests, prev_job_outputs) -> List[JobManifest]`\n- Break the document(s) into chunks (using the provided chunking function, if needed). Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 12 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`. All **multi-chunk integration** or **global reasoning** is your responsibility here.\n- Return one **aggregated string** suitable for further supervisor inspection.\n\n\n\n## Relevant Pydantic Models\n\nThe following models are already in the global scope. **Do NOT redefine or re-import them.**\n\n### JobManifest Model\n```\nclass JobManifest(BaseModel):\n    chunk: str  # the actual text for the chunk of the document\n    task: str  # the actual task instruction for the small model\n    advice: str  # optional, any additional advice on how to perform the task\n\n    chunk_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    task_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    job_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n\n```\n\n### JobOutput Model\n```\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    citation: Optional[str]\n    answer: Optional[str]\n\n```\n\n## Function Signatures\n```\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        context (List[str]): A list of documents.

The `transform_outputs` function then aggregates these figures, organizing them by year for further analysis. This approach ensures that each task is atomic and focused on a single chunk, while the supervisor handles the integration of information across chunks."

We and other network-based providers must ensure that our networks can meet these increasing capacity \nusage requirements and offer highly reliable national coverage. \n• \nPricing. With respect to wireless services and equipment, pricing plays an increasingly important role in the wireless \ncompetitive landscape. As the demand for wireless services continues to grow, wireless service providers are offering a \nrange of service plans at competitive prices. Many wireless service providers also bundle wireless service offerings with \nother content and offer promotional pricing and incentives, some of which may be targeted specifically to customers of \nVerizon. We and other wireless service providers, as well as equipment manufacturers, offer device payment options, \nwhich provide customers with the ability to pay for their device over a period of time, and some providers offer device \nleasing arrangements.  In addition, aggressive device promotions have become more common in an effort to gain a \ngreater share of subscribers interested in changing carriers as well as retaining existing customers. Pricing also plays \nan important role in the wireline competitive landscape, as traditional service providers compete aggressively in \nofferings such as IP Networking, Core Voice and other legacy products. In addition, as non-traditional modes of \nproviding wireline communication services emerge, new entrants attempt to capture market share from incumbents \n   9 \n \n            Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n\n\nusing competitive pricing. For example, VoIP and portal-based voice and video calling is often free or nearly free for \ncustomers and supported by advertising revenues. \n• \nCustomer service. We believe that high-quality customer service is a key factor in retaining customers and attracting \nnew customers, including those of other providers. Our customer service, retention and satisfaction programs are based \non providing customers with convenient and easy-to-use products and services and focusing on their needs in order to \npromote long-term relationships and minimize churn. \nCustomer service is highly valued by our Business customers. We provide Global Enterprise and Public Sector and \nOther customers with ready access to their system and performance information, and we conduct proactive testing of \nour networks to identify issues before they affect our customers.

Features \nsuch as wireless and wireline inter-operability are becoming increasingly important, driven by both customer demand \nand technological advancement. \n• \nSales and distribution. A key to achieving sales success in the consumer and small and medium business sectors of the \nwireless industry is the reach and quality of sales channels and distribution points. We seek to optimally vary distribution \nchannels among our company-operated stores selling wireless products and services, web-based sales and fulfillment \ncapabilities, outside sales teams and telemarketing, our extensive indirect distribution network of retail outlets and our \nsale of wireless service to resellers, which resell wireless services to their end users. \nIn addition to these competitive factors and trends, our competitive position also depends on our ability to market our products \nand services effectively, anticipate and respond to various factors and trends affecting our industries, as well as the availability of \ncapital resources. \nCompanies with a global presence are increasingly competing with us in our Business segment. A relatively small number of \ntelecommunications and integrated service providers with global operations serve customers in the global enterprise market and, \nto a lesser extent, the global wholesale market. We compete with these providers for large contracts to provide integrated \nsolutions to global enterprises and government customers. Many of these companies have strong market presence, brand \nrecognition and existing customer relationships, all of which contribute to intensifying competition that may affect our future \nrevenue growth. \nIn the Small and Medium Business market, customer purchasing behaviors and preferences continue to evolve. Solution speed \nand simplicity with user interfaces that have a consumer-like \"look and feel\" are becoming key differentiators for customers who \nare seeking full life-cycle offers that simplify the process of starting, running and growing their businesses. Several major cable \noperators also offer bundles with wireless services through strategic relationships. \nIn the Global Enterprise and Public Sector and Other markets, competition levels remain high, primarily as a result of increased \nindustry focus on technology convergence.

In addition, mobile video and \ndata needs are driving a greater need for wireless backhaul. Network providers, cable companies and niche players are \ncompetitors for this business opportunity. \nRegulatory Trends \nRegulatory Landscape \nVerizon operates in a regulated and highly competitive market, as described above. Some of our competitors are subject to fewer \nregulatory constraints than Verizon. For many services offered by Verizon, the FCC is our primary regulator. The FCC has \njurisdiction over interstate telecommunications services and other matters under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended \n(Communications Act or Act). Other Verizon services are subject to state and local regulation.\nVerizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K                                10 \n\n\nFederal, State and Local Regulation \nWireless Services \nThe FCC regulates several aspects of our wireless operations. Generally, the FCC has jurisdiction over the construction, \noperation, acquisition and transfer of wireless communications systems. All wireless services require use of radio frequency \nspectrum, the assignment and distribution of which is subject to FCC oversight. If demand continues to increase or if new \nspectrum is required for a future generation of technology, we can meet our needs for licensed spectrum by purchasing licenses \nor leasing spectrum from others, or by participating in a competitive bidding process to acquire new spectrum from the FCC. \nThose processes are subject to certain reviews, approvals and potential conditions. \nToday, Verizon holds FCC spectrum licenses that allow it to provide a wide range of mobile and fixed communications services, \nincluding both voice and data services. FCC spectrum licenses typically have a term of 10 years, at which time they are subject \nto renewal. While the FCC has routinely renewed all of Verizon’s wireless licenses, challenges could be raised in the future. If a \nwireless license was revoked or not renewed, Verizon would not be permitted to provide services on the spectrum covered by \nthat license. Some of our licenses require us to comply with so-called \"open access\" FCC regulations, which generally require \nlicensees of particular spectrum to allow customers to use devices and applications of their choice, subject to certain technical \nlimitations. The FCC has also imposed certain specific mandates on wireless carriers, including construction and geographic \ncoverage requirements, technical operatin",

For example, some states \nimpose reporting and consumer protection requirements. Several states also have laws or regulations that address safety issues \n(for example, use of wireless handsets while driving), universal service funding, and taxation matters. Some states are also \nconsidering new network reliability or service quality requirements that may affect how and where we provide services if not \npreempted by federal law. In addition, wireless tower and antenna facilities are often subject to state and local zoning and land \nuse regulation, and securing approvals for new or modified facilities is often a lengthy and expensive process. \nBroadband \nVerizon offers many different broadband services. The FCC currently recognizes broadband internet access services as \n\"information services\" subject to a \"light touch\" regulatory approach rather than to the traditional, utilities-style regulations. \nHowever, the FCC could return to a more utilities-style regulation of broadband. Additionally, several states have adopted or are \nconsidering adopting laws or executive orders that would regulate broadband.  Although some of these have been challenged in \ncourt, the ultimate enforceability and effect of these state rules is uncertain. Regardless of regulation, Verizon remains committed \nto the open internet, which provides consumers with competitive choices and unblocked access to lawful websites and content. \nOur broadband commitment can be found on our website at https://www.verizon.com/about/our-company/verizon-broadband-\ncommitment. \nWireline Voice \nVerizon offers many different wireline voice services, including traditional telephone service and other services that rely on \ntechnologies such as VoIP. For regulatory purposes, legacy telephone services are generally considered to be \"common carrier\" \nservices. Common carrier services are subject to heightened regulatory oversight with respect to rates, terms and conditions and \nother aspects of the services. The FCC has not decided the regulatory classification of VoIP but has said VoIP service providers \nmust comply with certain rules, such as 911 capabilities and law enforcement assistance requirements. \nState public utility commissions regulate Verizon’s telephone operations with respect to certain telecommunications intrastate \nmatters. Verizon operates as an \"incumbent local exchange carrier\" in nine states and the District of Columbia.

Some states, including California, impose reporting requirements and are \nconsidering new network reliability or service quality requirements for wireline voice services, including for VoIP. \nVideo \nVerizon offers a multichannel video service that is regulated like traditional cable service. The FCC has a body of rules that apply \nto cable operators, and these rules also generally apply to Verizon. In areas where Verizon offers its facilities-based multichannel \nvideo services, Verizon has been required to obtain a cable franchise from local government entities, or in some cases a state-\nwide franchise, and comply with certain one-time and ongoing obligations as a result. \nPrivacy and Data Security \nWe are subject to local, state, federal, and international laws and regulations relating to privacy and data security that impact all \nparts of our business, including wireline, wireless, broadband and the development and roll out of new products, such as those in \nthe artificial intelligence and IoT space. At the federal level, our business is governed by the FCC or the Federal Trade \nCommission (FTC), depending on the product or service.

Generally, attention to privacy and data security requirements is increasing at all levels of \ngovernment globally, and privacy-related legislation has been introduced or is under consideration in many locations. These \nregulations could have a significant impact on our businesses. \nPublic Safety and Cybersecurity \nThe FCC plays a role in addressing public safety concerns by regulating emergency communications services and mandating \nwidespread availability of both media (broadcast/cable) and wireless emergency alerting services. In response to cyber attacks \nthat have occurred or could occur in the future, however, the FCC or other regulators may attempt to increase regulation of the \ncybersecurity practices of providers. The FCC is also addressing the use by American companies of equipment produced by \ncertain companies deemed to cause potential national security risks. Verizon does not currently use equipment in its networks \nfrom vendors under such restrictions. In addition, due to recent natural disasters, federal and state agencies may attempt to \nimpose regulations to ensure continuity of service during disasters. For example, the FCC adopted rules requiring wireless \nproviders to support roaming on each other’s networks during disasters, and the California Public Utilities Commission has \nimposed regulations relating to back-up power for communications facilities. \nIntercarrier Compensation and Network Access \nThe FCC regulates some of the rates that carriers pay each other for the exchange of voi",

During the year ended December 31, 2022, these investments included $23.1 billion for \ncapital expenditures, inclusive of approximately $6.2 billion in C-Band related capital expenditures. See \"Cash Flows Used in \nInvesting Activities\" and \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" for additional information. We believe that our investments aimed at \nexpanding our portfolio of products and services will provide our customers with an efficient, reliable infrastructure for competing \nin the information economy. \nGlobal Network and Technology \nWe are focusing our capital spending on adding capacity and density to our 4G Long-Term Evolution (LTE) network, while also \nbuilding our next generation 5G network. We are densifying our networks by utilizing small cell technology, in-building solutions \nand distributed antenna systems. Network densification enables us to add capacity to address increasing mobile video \nconsumption and the growing demand for IoT products and services on our 4G LTE and 5G networks. Over the past several \nyears, we have been leading the development of 5G wireless technology industry standards and the ecosystems for fixed and \nmobile 5G wireless services. 5G technology enables higher throughput and lower latency than the 4G LTE technology and allows \nour networks to handle more traffic as the number of internet-connected devices grows. In January 2022, we began deploying C-\nBand spectrum, which has been built out to cover approximately 189 million POPs in the U.S. as of December 31, 2022. We \nexpect to continue deploying C-Band spectrum across the continental U.S. as more and more of the spectrum becomes \navailable for our use. We use low and mid-band spectrum and dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS) technology, to allow 5G service \nto run simultaneously with 4G LTE on multiple spectrum bands. With DSS, whenever customers move outside Verizon’s \nmillimeter wave and C-Band coverage areas, their 5G-enabled devices will remain on 5G technology using the lower spectrum \nbands where this network is available. This allows us to more fully and effectively utilize our current spectrum resources to serve \nboth 4G and 5G customers. \nTo compensate for the shrinking market for traditional copper-based products, we continue to build fiber-based networks \nsupporting data, video and advanced business services - areas where demand for reliable high-speed connections is growing. \nWe are transforming the architecture of our networks into our Intelligent Edge Network, providing improved efficiency and \nvirtualization, increased automation and opportunities for edge computing services that will support our fiber-based and radio \na",

We also compete for retail activations with resellers that buy bulk wholesale service from wireless service providers, \nincluding Verizon, and resell it to their customers.

We face competition from other communications and technology companies seeking to \nincrease their brand recognition and capture customer revenue with respect to the provision of wireless products and services, in \naddition to non-traditional offerings in mobile data. For example, Microsoft Corporation, Alphabet Inc., Apple Inc., Meta Platforms, \nInc. and others are offering alternative means for messaging and making wireless voice calls that, in certain cases, can be used \nin lieu of the wireless providers' voice service, as well as alternative means of accessing video content. In addition, we expect to \nsee increasing competition in the provisioning of internet access by low Earth orbit satellite companies as well in the area of fixed \nwireless offerings that provide an alternative to traditional landline internet service providers. \nWith respect to wireless services and equipment, pricing plays an increasingly important role in the wireless competitive \nlandscape. We compete in this area by offering our customers services and devices that we believe they will regard as the best \navailable value for the price. As the demand for wireless services continues to grow, wireless service providers are offering a \nrange of service plans at competitive prices. These service offerings will vary from time to time based on customer needs, \ntechnology changes and market conditions and may be provided as standard plans or as part of limited time promotional offers. \nIn addition, aggressive device promotions have become more common in an effort to gain a greater share of subscribers \ninterested in changing carriers as well as retaining existing customers. \nWe expect future service revenue growth opportunities to arise from increased access revenue as customer demand for 5G \nconnectivity continues to expand and customers shift to higher access plans, driven in part by attractive bundled content with \npremium brands, as well as from increased connections per account.

A securities rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization.

Free cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital \nexpenditures (including capitalized software) from net cash provided by operating activities. We believe it is a more conservative \nmeasure of cash flow since capital expenditures are necessary for ongoing operations.

These plans primarily \nrelate to our domestic business units. We made no discretionary contribution to our qualified pension plan in either 2022 or 2021. \nDuring 2022 and 2021, we made contributions of $53 million and $58 million to our nonqualified pension plans, respectively. \nOur overall investment strategy is to achieve a mix of assets that allows us to meet projected benefit payments while taking into \nconsideration risk and return. In an effort to reduce the risk of our portfolio strategy and better align assets with liabilities, we \nhave adopted a liability driven pension strategy that seeks to better match the interest rate sensitivity of the liability hedging \nassets with the interest rate sensitivity of the liability. We expect that the strategy will reduce the likelihood that assets will decline \nat a time when liabilities increase (referred to as liability hedging), with the goal to reduce the risk of underfunding to the plan and \nits participants and beneficiaries. Over time, as the asset allocation shifts to more liability hedging assets, this strategy will \ngenerally result in lower expected asset returns. In 2023, we expect discretionary qualified pension plan contributions to be \napproximately $200 million and nonqualified pension plan contributions to be insignificant. \nContributions to our other postretirement benefit plans generally relate to payments for benefits on an as-incurred basis since \nthese other postretirement benefit plans do not have funding requirements similar to the pension plans.

Although we use consistent methodologies in developing the \nassumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations used in our impairment tests, these estimates and assumptions \nare uncertain by nature, may change over time and can vary from actual results. It is possible that in the future there may be \nchanges in our estimates and assumptions, including the timing and amount of future cash flows, margins, growth rates, market \nparticipant assumptions, comparable benchmark companies and related multiples and discount rates, which could result in \ndifferent fair value estimates.

Our quantitative \nimpairment assessment consisted of comparing the estimated fair value of our aggregate wireless licenses to the aggregated \ncarrying amount as of the test date. Under our quantitative assessment, we estimated the fair value of our wireless licenses \nusing the Greenfield approach.

While we may be exposed to credit losses due to the nonperformance of our \ncounterparties, we consider the risk remote and do not expect that any such nonperformance would result in a significant effect \non our results of operations or financial condition due to our diversified pool of counterparties. See Note 9 to the consolidated \nfinancial statements for additional information regarding the derivative portfolio. \nInterest Rate Risk \nWe are exposed to changes in interest rates, primarily on our short-term debt and the portion of long-term debt that carries \nfloating interest rates. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 74% of the aggregate principal amount of our total debt portfolio \nconsisted of fixed-rate indebtedness, including the effect of interest rate swap agreements designated as hedges. The impact of \na 100-basis-point change in interest rates affecting our floating rate debt would result in a change in annual interest expense, \nincluding our interest rate swap agreements that are designated as hedges, of approximately $420 million. The interest rates on \nour existing long-term debt obligations are unaffected by changes to our credit ratings. \nCertain of our floating rate debt and certain of our interest rate derivative transactions utilize interest rates that are linked to the \nLondon Inter-Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) as the benchmark rate. The U.S. dollar LIBOR rates utilized in these transactions will \ncease publication after June 30, 2023, in accordance with recent U.S. and international regulatory guidance for reform. The \nconsequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted but could include an increase in the cost of our floating rate \ndebt or exposure under our interest rate derivative transactions.

At \nDecember 31, 2022, the Company’s aggregate defined benefit pension obligation was $15.3 billion \nand exceeded the fair value of pension plan assets of $13.7 billion, resulting in an unfunded defined \nbenefit pension obligation of $1.6 billion. Also, at December 31, 2022, the other postretirement \nbenefits obligation was approximately $11.1 billion. As explained in Note 11 of the consolidated \nfinancial statements, the Company updates the estimates used to measure employee benefit \nobligations and plan assets in the fourth quarter and upon a remeasurement event to reflect the actual \nreturn on plan assets and updated actuarial assumptions. \nAuditing the employee benefit obligations was complex due to the highly judgmental nature of the \nactuarial assumptions (e.g., discount rate, health care cost trends and per capita claims cost trends) \nused in the measurement process.

We compared the actuarial assumptions used by management to historical \ntrends, current economic factors and evaluated the change in the employee benefit obligations from \nprior year due to the change in service cost, interest cost, actuarial gains and losses, benefit \npayments, contributions and other activities. In addition, we involved an actuarial specialist to assist in \nevaluating management’s methodology for determining the discount rate that reflects the maturity and \nduration of the benefit payments and is used to measure the employee benefit obligations. As part of \nthis assessment, we compared the projected cash flows to prior year projections and compared the \ncurrent year benefits paid to the prior year projected cash flows. To evaluate the health care cost \ntrends and per capita claims cost trends, we involved an actuarial specialist to assist in evaluating the \nassumptions and assessed whether the information was consistent with publicly available information, \nand whether any market data adjusted for entity-specific adjustments were applied.

As discussed in Notes 1 and 4 of \nthe consolidated financial statements, goodwill is not amortized but rather is tested for impairment at \nthe reporting unit level at least annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. The \nimpairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit (calculated using a combination of a \nmarket approach and an income approach) to its carrying amount. \nAuditing management’s goodwill impairment test was complex and highly judgmental due to the \ninherent subjectivity of developing an estimate of the fair value of the reporting unit, which is based on \nassumptions about future conditions, transactions, or events whose outcome is uncertain and will \ntherefore be subject to change over time. In particular, the fair value estimate was sensitive to \nsignificant assumptions such as the discount rate, revenue growth rate and earnings before interest, \ntaxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) margins, which are affected by expected future market \nor economic conditions. \nHow We Addressed the \nMatter in Our Audit \nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of \ncontrols over the Company’s goodwill impairment review process.

Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies \nDescription of Business \nVerizon Communications Inc. (the Company) is a holding company that, acting through its subsidiaries (together with the \nCompany, collectively, Verizon), is one of the world’s leading providers of communications, technology, information and \nentertainment products and services to consumers, businesses and government entities. With a presence around the world, we \noffer data, video and voice services and solutions on our networks and platforms that are designed to meet customers’ demand \nfor mobility, reliable network connectivity, security and control. \nWe have two reportable segments that we operate and manage as strategic business units - Verizon Consumer Group \n(Consumer) and Verizon Business Group (Business). \nOur Consumer segment provides consumer-focused wireless and wireline communications services and products. Our wireless \nservices are provided across one of the most extensive wireless networks in the United States (U.S.) under the Verizon brand, \nTracFone Wireless, Inc. (TracFone) brands and through wholesale and other arrangements. We also provide fixed wireless \naccess (FWA) broadband through our wireless networks. Our wireline services are provided in nine states in the Mid-Atlantic and \nNortheastern U.S., as well as Washington D.C., over our 100% fiber-optic network through our Verizon Fios product portfolio and \nover a traditional copper-based network to customers who are not served by Fios. Our Consumer segment's wireless and \nwireline products and services are available to our retail customers, as well as resellers that purchase wireless network access \nfrom us on a wholesale basis. \nOur Business segment provides wireless and wireline communications services and products, including data, video and \nconferencing services, corporate networking solutions, security and managed network services, local and long distance voice \nservices and network access to deliver various Internet of Things (IoT) services and products. We also provide FWA broadband \nthrough our wireless networks. We provide these products and services to businesses, government customers and wireless and \nwireline carriers across the U.S. and select products and services to customers around the world. \nConsolidation \nThe method of accounting applied to investments, whether consolidated or equity, involves an evaluation of all significant terms \nof the investments that explicitly grant or suggest evidence of control or influence over the operations of the investee.

Equity method investments \nare included in Investments in unconsolidated businesses in our consolidated balance sheets. All significant intercompany \naccounts and transactions have been eliminated. \nBasis of Presentation \nWe have reclassified certain prior year amounts to conform to the current year presentation. \nUse of Estimates \nWe prepare our financial statements using U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which requires management \nto make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and disclosures. These estimates and assumptions take into \naccount historical and forward-looking factors that the Company believes are reasonable, including but not limited to public \nhealth crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and related economic implications. Actual results could differ significantly from \nthose estimates. \nExamples of significant estimates include the allowance for credit losses, the recoverability of intangible assets, property, plant \nand equipment, and other long-lived assets, the incremental borrowing rate for the lease liability, fair value measurements, \nincluding those related to financial instruments, goodwill, spectrum licenses and intangible assets, unrecognized tax benefits, \nvaluation allowances on tax assets, pension and postretirement benefit obligations, contingencies and the identification and \nvaluation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with business combinations. \nRevenue Recognition \nWe earn revenue from contracts with customers, primarily through the provision of telecommunications and other services and \nthrough the sale of wireless equipment. These services include a variety of communication and connectivity services for our \nConsumer and Business customers including other carriers that use our facilities to provide services to their customers, as well \nas professional and integrated managed services for our large enterprises and government customers.

For wireless service, we recognize revenue \nusing an output method, either as the service allowance units are used or as time elapses, because it reflects the pattern by \nwhich we satisfy our performance obligation through the transfer of service to the customer. Monthly service is generally billed in \nadvance, which results in a contract liability. See Note 2 for additional information. For postpaid plans, where monthly usage \nexceeds the allowance, the overage usage represents options held by the customer for incremental services and the usage-\nbased fee is recognized when the customer exercises the option (typically on a month-to-month basis). \nFor our contracts related to wireline communication and connectivity services, in general, fixed monthly fees for service are billed \none month in advance, which results in a contract liability, and service revenue is recognized over the enforceable contract term \nas the service is rendered, as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the services through network \naccess and usage. While substantially all of our wireline service revenue contracts are the result of providing access to our \nnetworks, revenue from services that are not fixed in amount and, instead, are based on usage are generally billed in arrears and \nrecognized as the usage occurs. \nEquipment \nWe sell wireless devices and accessories under the Verizon brand and other brands. Equipment revenue is generally recognized \nwhen the products are delivered to and accepted by the customer, as this is when control passes to the customer. In addition to \noffering the sale of equipment on a standalone basis, we have two primary offerings through which customers pay for a wireless \ndevice, in connection with a service contract: fixed-term plans and device payment plans. \nUnder a fixed-term plan, the customer is sold the wireless device without any upfront charge or at a discounted price in exchange \nfor entering into a fixed-term service contract (typically for a term of 24 months or less). \nUnder a device payment plan, the customer is sold the wireless device in exchange for a non-interest-bearing installment note, \nwhich is repaid by the customer, typically over a 36-month term, and concurrently enters into a month-to-month contract for \nwireless service. We may offer certain promotions that provide billing credits applied over a specified term, contingent upon the \ncustomer maintaining service. The credits are included in the transaction price, which are allocated to the performance \nobligations based on their relative selling price and are recognized when earned. \nA financing component exists in both our fixed-term plans and device payment plans because the timing of the payment for the \ndevice, which occurs over the contract term, differs from the satisfaction of the performance obligation, which occurs at contract \ninception upon transfer of the d",

We periodically assess, at the contract level, the significance of the \nfinancing component inherent in our fixed-term and device payment plan receivable based on qualitative and quantitative \nconsiderations related to our customer classes. These considerations include assessing the commercial objective of our plans, \nthe term and duration of financing provided, interest rates prevailing in the marketplace, and credit risks of our customer classes, \nall of which impact our selection of appropriate discount rates. Based on current facts and circumstances, we determined that the \nfinancing component in our existing wireless device payments and fixed-term contracts sold through the direct channel is not \nsignificant and therefore is not accounted for separately. See Note 8 for additional information on the interest on equipment \nfinanced on a device payment plan agreement when sold to the customer by an authorized agent in our indirect channel. \nWireless Contracts \nFor our wireless contracts, total contract revenue, which represents the transaction price for wireless service and wireless \nequipment, is allocated between service and equipment revenue based on their estimated standalone selling prices. We \nestimate the standalone selling price of the device or accessory to be its retail price excluding subsidies or conditional purchase \ndiscounts. We estimate the standalone selling price of wireless service to be the price that we offer to customers on month-to-\nmonth contracts that can be cancelled at any time without penalty (i.e., when there is no fixed-term for service) or when service is \nprocured without the concurrent purchase of a wireless device. In addition, we also assess whether the service term is impacted \nby certain legally enforceable rights and obligations in our contract with customers, such as penalties that a customer would have \nto pay to early terminate a fixed-term contract or billing credits that would cease if the month-to-month wireless service is \ncanceled. The assessment of these legally enforceable rights and obligations involves judgment and impacts our determination \nof the transaction price and related disclosures. \nFrom time to time, we may offer certain promotions that provide our customers on device payment plans with the right to upgrade \nto a new device after paying a specified portion of their device payment plan agreement amount and trading in their device in \ngood working order.

Additionally, customers may incur charges based on usage or additional optional \nservices purchased in conjunction with entering into a contract that can be cancelled at any time and therefore are not included \nin the transaction price. The transaction price allocated to service performance obligations, which are not satisfied or are partially \nsatisfied as of the end of the reporting period, are generally related to contracts that are not accounted for as month-to-month \ncontracts. \nOur Consumer group customers also include traditional wholesale resellers that purchase and resell wireless service under their \nown brands to their respective custome",

As a result of the changes in the provisional fair value and amortization period of certain intangible assets \nduring the one-year measurement period, amortization expense decreased $110 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. \nOther intangible assets include $2.4 billion related to customer relationships, with a weighted-average amortization period of 7 \nyears, $1.1 billion related to distribution relationships, with an amortization period of 5 years, $740 million related to trade names \nwith a weighted-average amortization period of 17 years and $145 million related to acquired technology, with an amortization \nperiod of 10 years. The intangible assets were assigned fair values using an income approach. The valuations are considered \nLevel 3 fair value measurements due to the use of significant inputs not observable in the market, which include the discount \nrate, royalty rate and amount and timing of future cash flows. \nGoodwill is calculated as the difference between the Acquisition Date fair value of the consideration paid and payable and the fair \nvalue of the net assets acquired, representing future economic benefits that we expect to achieve as a result of the acquisition. \nThe goodwill related to this acquisition is included within the Consumer segment. \nPursuant to the TracFone Purchase Agreement, América Móvil agreed to indemnify Verizon against certain pre-acquisition tax \nmatters and other contingencies.

When a customer enters into a device payment plan agreement with the right to \nupgrade to a new device, we account for this trade-in right as a guarantee obligation. We recognize a liability measured at fair \nvalue for the customer’s right to trade in the device which is determined by considering several factors, including the weighted-\naverage selling prices obtained in recent resales of similar devices eligible for trade-in. At December 31, 2022 and December 31, \n2021, the amount of the guarantee liability was $54 million and $77 million, respectively. \nWe may offer certain promotions that allow a customer to trade in their owned device in connection with the purchase of a new \ndevice. Under these types of promotions, the customer receives a credit for the value of the trade-in device. At December 31, \n2022 and December 31, 2021, the amount of trade-in liability was $562 million and $366 million, respectively. \nIn addition, we may provide the customer with additional future billing credits that will be applied against the customer’s monthly \nbill as long as service is maintained. These future billing credits are accounted for as consideration payable to a customer and \nare included in the determination of total transaction price, resulting in a contract liability. \nDevice payment plan agreement receivables, net, does not reflect the trade-in liability, additional future credits or the guarantee \nliability. \nOrigination of Device Payment Plan Agreements \nWhen originating device payment plan agreements, we use internal and external data sources to create a credit risk score to \nmeasure the credit quality of a customer and to determine eligibility for the device payment program. Verizon’s experience has \nbeen that the payment attributes of longer tenured customers are highly predictive for estimating their reliability to make future \npayments. Customers with longer tenures tend to exhibit similar risk characteristics to other customers with longer tenures, and \nreceivables due from customers with longer tenures tend to perform better than receivables from customers that have not \npreviously been Verizon customers. As a result of this experience, we make initial lending decisions based upon whether the \ncustomers are \"established customers\" or \"short-tenured customers.\" If a Consumer customer has been a customer for 45 days \n   83 \n \n            Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n\n\nor more, or if a Business customer has been a customer for 12 months or more, the customer is considered an \"established \ncustomer.\" For established customers, the credit decision and ongoing credit monitoring processes rely on a combination of \ninternal and external data sources.

The custom credit risk score is generated automatically from the applicant’s credit data using \nproprietary custom credit models. The credit risk score measures the likelihood that the potential customer will become severely \ndelinquent and be disconnected for non-payment. For a small portion of short-tenured customer applications, a traditional credit \nreport is not available from one of the national credit reporting agencies because the potential customer does not have sufficient \ncredit history. In those instances, alternative credit data is used for the risk assessment. For Business customers, we also verify \nthe existence of the business with external data sources. \nBased on the custom credit risk score, we assign each customer a credit class, each of which has specified offers of credit. This \nincludes an account level spending limit and a maximum amount of credit allowed per device for Consumer customers or a \nrequired down payment percentage for Business customers. \nCredit Quality Information \nSubsequent to origination, we assess indicators for the quality of our wireless device payment plan agreement portfolio using two \nmodels, one for new customers and one for existing customers.

Stock-Based Compensation \nVerizon Long-Term Incentive Plan \nIn May 2017, our shareholders approved the 2017 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 2017 Plan) and terminated the Company's \nauthority to grant new awards under the Verizon 2009 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 2009 Plan). The 2017 Plan provides for \nbroad-based equity grants to employees, including executive officers, and permits the granting of stock options, stock \nappreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance stock units and other awards.

Shares subject to outstanding awards under the 2009 Plan that expire, are canceled or otherwise \nterminated will also be available for awards under the 2017 Plan. As of December 31, 2022, 69 million shares are reserved for \nfuture issuance under the 2017 Plan. \nRestricted Stock Units \nRestricted Stock Units (RSUs) granted under the 2017 Plan generally vest in three equal installments on each anniversary of the \ngrant date. The RSUs that are paid in stock upon vesting and are thus classified as equity awards are measured using the grant \ndate fair value of Verizon common stock and are not remeasured at the end of each reporting period. The RSUs that are settled \nin cash are classified as liability awards and the liability is measured at its fair value at the end of each reporting period. All RSUs \ngranted under the 2017 Plan have dividend equivalent units (DEUs), which will be paid to participants if, and only to the extent \nthe applicable RSU award vests, and is paid at the time the RSU award is paid, and in the same proportion as the RSU award. In \n2020, Verizon announced a broad-based program that provides for the annual award of cash-settled RSUs under the 2017 Plan \nto all full-time and part-time employees who meet eligibility requirements. \nWe estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those \nestimates. We use historical data to estimate forfeitures and recognize that estimated compensation cost of restricted stock \nunits, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. \nPerformance Stock Units \nThe 2017 Plan also provides for grants of Performance Stock Units (PSUs) that generally vest at the end of the third year after \nthe grant.

The \ncarrying value of cash equivalents approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these investments. \nInvestments in securities traded on national and foreign securities exchanges are valued by the trustee at the last reported sale \nprices on the last business day of the year or, if no sales were reported on that date, at the last reported bid prices. Government \nobligations, corporate bonds, international bonds and asset-backed debt are valued using matrix prices with input from \nindependent third-party valuation sources. Over-the-counter securities are valued at the bid prices or the average of the bid and \nask prices on the last business day of the year from published sources or, if not available, from other sources considered reliable \nsuch as multiple broker quotes. \nCommingled funds not traded on national exchanges are priced by the custodian or fund's administrator at their net asset value \n(NAV). Commingled funds held by third-party custodians appointed by the fund managers provide the fund managers with a NAV. \nThe fund managers have the responsibility for providing this information to the custodian of the respective plan. \nThe investment manager of the entity values venture capital, corporate finance and natural resource limited partnership \ninvestments. Real estate investments are valued at amounts based upon appraisal reports prepared by either independent real \nestate appraisers or the investment manager using discounted cash flows or market comparable data. Loans secured by \nmortgages are carried at the lesser of the unpaid balance or appraised value of the underlying properties. The values assigned \nto these investments are based upon available and current market information and do not necessarily represent amounts that \nmight ultimately be realized. Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, estimated fair values might differ significantly from \nthe values that would have been used had a ready market for the securities existed. These differences could be material. \nForward currency contracts, futures, and options are valued by the trustee at the exchange rates and market prices prevailing on \nthe last business day of the year. Both exchange rates and market prices are readily available from published sources. These \nsecurities are classified by the asset",

Commitments and Contingencies \nIn the ordinary course of business, Verizon is involved in various commercial litigation and regulatory proceedings at the state \nand federal level. Where it is determined, in consultation with counsel based on litigation and settlement risks, that a loss is \nprobable and estimable in a given matter, Verizon establishes an accrual. In none of the currently pending matters is the amount \nof accrual material. An estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss in excess of the amounts already accrued \ncannot be made at this time due to various factors typical in contested proceedings, including: (1) uncertain damage theories and \ndemands; (2) a less than complete factual record; (3) uncertainty concerning legal theories and their resolution by courts or \nregulators; and (4) the unpredictable nature of the opposing party and its demands. We continuously monitor these proceedings \nas they develop and adjust any accrual or disclosure as needed. We do not expect that the ultimate resolution of any pending \nregulatory or legal matter in future periods will have a material effect on our financial condition, but it could have a material effect \non our results of operations for a given reporting period. \nVerizon is currently involved in approximately 25 federal district court actions alleging that Verizon is infringing various patents. \nMost of these cases are brought by no",

These cases have progressed to various \nstages and a small number may go to trial in the coming 12 months if they are not otherwise resolved. \nIn connection with the execution of agreements for the sales of businesses and investments, Verizon ordinarily provides \nrepresentations and warranties to the purchasers pertaining to a variety of nonfinancial matters, such as ownership of the \nsecurities being sold, as well as indemnity from certain financial losses. From time to time, counterparties may make claims \nunder these provisions, and Verizon will seek to defend against those claims and resolve them in the ordinary course of \nbusiness. \nAs of December 31, 2022, letters of credit totaling approximately $834 million, which were executed in the normal course of \nbusiness and support several financing arrangements and payment obligations to third parties, were outstanding. \nDuring 2022, Verizon entered into four renewable energy purchase agreements (REPAs) with third parties, in addition to 20 \nsigned in previous years. Each of the REPAs is based on the expected operation of a renewable energy-generating facility and \nhas a fixed price term of 12 to 18 years from the commencement of the facility's entry into commercial operation. Seven of the \nfacilities have entered into commercial operation, and the remainder are under development. The REPAs generally are expected \nto be financially settled based on the prevailing market price as energy is generated by the facilities. \nWe have various unconditional purchase obligations, which represent agreements to purchase goods or services that are \nenforceable and legally binding. We estimate that these unconditional purchase obligations, for contracts with terms in excess of \none year, total $24.5 billion, and primarily represent commitments to purchase network equipment, software and services, \ncontent, marketing services and other items which will be used or sold in the ordinary course of business from a variety of \nsuppliers. Of this total amount, $9.4 billion is attributable to 2023, $6.9 billion is attributable to 2024, $5.5 billion is attributable to \n2025, $1.4 billion is attributable to 2026, $772 million is attributable to 2027 and $524 million is attributable to years thereafter. \nThese amounts do not represent our entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items that are the \nVerizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K                                106 \n\n\nsubject of contractual obligations.

Controls and Procedures \nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures \nOur Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant’s disclosure controls \nand procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), as of the end of the \nperiod covered by this Annual Report, that ensure that information relating to the registrant which is required to be disclosed in \nthis report is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within required time periods using the criteria for effective internal \ncontrol established in Internal Control–Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the \nTreadway Commission in 2013. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded \nthat the registrant’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2022. \nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting \nIn the ordinary course of business, we routinely review our system of internal control over financial reporting and make changes \nto our systems and processes that are intended to ensure an effective internal control environment. In the third quarter of 2020, \nwe began a multi-year implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, which will replace many of \nour existing core financial systems. The new ERP system is designed to enhance the flow of financial information, facilitate data \nanalysis and accelerate information reporting. The implementation is expected to occur in phases over the next several years. \nAs the phased implementation of the new ERP system continues, we could have changes to our processes and procedures \nwhich, in turn, could result in changes to our internal controls over financial reporting. As such changes occur, we will evaluate \nquarterly whether such changes materially affect our internal control over financial reporting. \nThere were no changes in Verizon's internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter 2022 that have materially \naffected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. \nManagement's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting \nThe management of Verizon Communications Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over \nfinancial reporting of Verizon.

      "output": "We have gathered a wide range of debt figures for Verizon for the fiscal years 2021 and 2022. The figures vary significantly, indicating potential inconsistencies or different interpretations of what constitutes \"total debt.\" Some figures are in billions, while others are in millions, and there are multiple entries for each year.\n\n1. **Information Gathered**: We have multiple debt figures for both 2021 and 2022, but they are inconsistent. For example, some outputs suggest $150.9 billion for 2021 and $150.6 billion for 2022, while others suggest $366,596 million for 2021 and $379,680 million for 2022.\n\n2. **Sufficiency**: The information is not sufficient to definitively answer the question due to the inconsistencies and lack of clarity on what each figure represents (e.g., total debt, specific types of debt, etc.).\n\n3. **Missing Information**: We need a clear, consistent definition of \"total debt\" and a reliable source or citation that confirms the correct figures for both years. Additionally, understanding the context of each figure (e.g., whether it includes all liabilities or just certain types) is crucial.\n\n4. **Deriving the Answer**: If we had consistent figures, we would compare the total debt for 2021 and 2022 to determine if there was an increase. For example, if the total debt was $150.9 billion in 2021 and $150.6 billion in 2022, it would indicate a decrease.\n\n5. **Conflicting Answers**: To resolve conflicts, we would need to rely on citations from the financial document that clearly state the total debt figures for each year. Without such citations, it's challenging to determine which figures are accurate.\n\nIn summary, the current data is too inconsistent to provide a definitive answer. We need more precise and reliable information, ideally with citations from the financial document, to accurately determine whether Verizon's debt increased between 2021 and 2022."

With respect to wireless services and equipment, pricing plays an increasingly important role in the wireless \ncompetitive landscape. As the demand for wireless services continues to grow, wireless service providers are offering a \nrange of service plans at competitive prices. Many wireless service providers also bundle wireless service offerings with \nother content and offer promotional pricing and incentives, some of which may be targeted specifically to customers of \nVerizon. We and other wireless service providers, as well as equipment manufacturers, offer device payment options, \nwhich provide customers with the ability to pay for their device over a period of time, and some providers offer device \nleasing arrangements.  In addition, aggressive device promotions have become more common in an effort to gain a \ngreater share of subscribers interested in changing carriers as well as retaining existing customers. Pricing also plays \nan important role in the wireline competitive landscape, as traditional service providers compete aggressively in \nofferings such as IP Networking, Core Voice and other legacy products.

In addition, mobile video and \ndata needs are driving a greater need for wireless backhaul. Network providers, cable companies and niche players are \ncompetitors for this business opportunity. \nRegulatory Trends \nRegulatory Landscape \nVerizon operates in a regulated and highly competitive market, as described above. Some of our competitors are subject to fewer \nregulatory constraints than Verizon. For many services offered by Verizon, the FCC is our primary regulator. The FCC has \njurisdiction over interstate telecommunications services and other matters under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended \n(Communications Act or Act). Other Verizon services are subject to state and local regulation.\nVerizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K                                10 \n\n\nFederal, State and Local Regulation \nWireless Services \nThe FCC regulates several aspects of our wireless operations. Generally, the FCC has jurisdiction over the construction, \noperation, acquisition and transfer of wireless communications systems. All wireless services require use of radio frequency \nspectrum, the assignment and distribution of which is subject to FCC oversight. If demand continues to increase or if new \nspectrum is required for a future generation of technology, we can meet our needs for licensed spectrum by purchasing licenses \nor leasing spectrum from others, or by participating in a competitive bidding process to acquire new spectrum from the FCC. \nThose processes are subject to certain reviews, approvals and potential conditions. \nToday, Verizon holds FCC spectrum licenses that allow it to provide a wide range of mobile and fixed communications services, \nincluding both voice and data services. FCC spectrum licenses typically have a term of 10 years, at which time they are subject \nto renewal. While the FCC has routinely renewed all of Verizon’s wireless licenses, challenges could be raised in the future. If a \nwireless license was revoked or not renewed, Verizon would not be permitted to provide services on the spectrum covered by \nthat license. Some of our licenses require us to comply with so-called \"open access\" FCC regulations, which generally require \nlicensees of particular spectrum to allow customers to use devices and applications of their choice, subject to certain technical \nlimitations. The FCC has also imposed certain specific mandates on wireless carriers, including construction and geographic \ncoverage requirements, technical operatin",

For example, some states \nimpose reporting and consumer protection requirements. Several states also have laws or regulations that address safety issues \n(for example, use of wireless handsets while driving), universal service funding, and taxation matters. Some states are also \nconsidering new network reliability or service quality requirements that may affect how and where we provide services if not \npreempted by federal law. In addition, wireless tower and antenna facilities are often subject to state and local zoning and land \nuse regulation, and securing approvals for new or modified facilities is often a lengthy and expensive process. \nBroadband \nVerizon offers many different broadband services. The FCC currently recognizes broadband internet access services as \n\"information services\" subject to a \"light touch\" regulatory approach rather than to the traditional, utilities-style regulations. \nHowever, the FCC could return to a more utilities-style regulation of broadband. Additionally, several states have adopted or are \nconsidering adopting laws or executive orders that would regulate broadband.  Although some of these have been challenged in \ncourt, the ultimate enforceability and effect of these state rules is uncertain. Regardless of regulation, Verizon remains committed \nto the open internet, which provides consumers with competitive choices and unblocked access to lawful websites and content. \nOur broadband commitment can be found on our website at https://www.verizon.com/about/our-company/verizon-broadband-\ncommitment. \nWireline Voice \nVerizon offers many different wireline voice services, including traditional telephone service and other services that rely on \ntechnologies such as VoIP. For regulatory purposes, legacy telephone services are generally considered to be \"common carrier\" \nservices. Common carrier services are subject to heightened regulatory oversight with respect to rates, terms and conditions and \nother aspects of the services. The FCC has not decided the regulatory classification of VoIP but has said VoIP service providers \nmust comply with certain rules, such as 911 capabilities and law enforcement assistance requirements. \nState public utility commissions regulate Verizon’s telephone operations with respect to certain telecommunications intrastate \nmatters. Verizon operates as an \"incumbent local exchange carrier\" in nine states and the District of Columbia.

Some states, including California, impose reporting requirements and are \nconsidering new network reliability or service quality requirements for wireline voice services, including for VoIP. \nVideo \nVerizon offers a multichannel video service that is regulated like traditional cable service. The FCC has a body of rules that apply \nto cable operators, and these rules also generally apply to Verizon. In areas where Verizon offers its facilities-based multichannel \nvideo services, Verizon has been required to obtain a cable franchise from local government entities, or in some cases a state-\nwide franchise, and comply with certain one-time and ongoing obligations as a result. \nPrivacy and Data Security \nWe are subject to local, state, federal, and international laws and regulations relating to privacy and data security that impact all \nparts of our business, including wireline, wireless, broadband and the development and roll out of new products, such as those in \nthe artificial intelligence and IoT space. At the federal level, our business is governed by the FCC or the Federal Trade \nCommission (FTC), depending on the product or service.

Generally, attention to privacy and data security requirements is increasing at all levels of \ngovernment globally, and privacy-related legislation has been introduced or is under consideration in many locations. These \nregulations could have a significant impact on our businesses. \nPublic Safety and Cybersecurity \nThe FCC plays a role in addressing public safety concerns by regulating emergency communications services and mandating \nwidespread availability of both media (broadcast/cable) and wireless emergency alerting services. In response to cyber attacks \nthat have occurred or could occur in the future, however, the FCC or other regulators may attempt to increase regulation of the \ncybersecurity practices of providers. The FCC is also addressing the use by American companies of equipment produced by \ncertain companies deemed to cause potential national security risks. Verizon does not currently use equipment in its networks \nfrom vendors under such restrictions. In addition, due to recent natural disasters, federal and state agencies may attempt to \nimpose regulations to ensure continuity of service during disasters. For example, the FCC adopted rules requiring wireless \nproviders to support roaming on each other’s networks during disasters, and the California Public Utilities Commission has \nimposed regulations relating to back-up power for communications facilities. \nIntercarrier Compensation and Network Access \nThe FCC regulates some of the rates that carriers pay each other for the exchange of voi",

In addition, the wireless industry’s customer growth rate could moderate \nin comparison to historical growth rates, leading to increased competition for customers. Our ability to compete effectively will \ndepend on, among other things, our network quality, capacity and coverage, the pricing of our products and services, the quality \nof our customer service, our development of new and enhanced products and services, the reach and quality of our sales and \ndistribution channels, our ability to market our products and services effectively and our capital resources. It will also depend on \nhow successfully we anticipate and respond to various factors affecting our industries, including new technologies and business \nmodels, changes in consumer preferences and demand for existing services, demographic trends and evolving economic \nconditions, including inflation. If we are not able to respond successfully to these competitive challenges, our results of \noperations and financial condition could be adversely impacted. In addition, a projected sustained decline in a reporting unit's \nrevenues and earnings could have a significant negative impact on its fair value and result in an impairment charge, which could \nhave an adverse impact on our results of operations. \nIf we are not able to take advantage of developments in technology and address changing consumer \ndemand on a timely basis, or if the deployment of our 5G network is delayed or hindered for any reason, we \nVerizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K                                14 \n\n\nmay experience a decline in the demand for our services, be unable to implement our business strategy and \nexperience reduced profits. \nOur industries are rapidly changing as new technologies are developed that offer consumers an array of choices for their \ncommunications needs and allow new entrants into the markets we serve.

During the year ended December 31, 2022, these investments included $23.1 billion for \ncapital expenditures, inclusive of approximately $6.2 billion in C-Band related capital expenditures. See \"Cash Flows Used in \nInvesting Activities\" and \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" for additional information. We believe that our investments aimed at \nexpanding our portfolio of products and services will provide our customers with an efficient, reliable infrastructure for competing \nin the information economy. \nGlobal Network and Technology \nWe are focusing our capital spending on adding capacity and density to our 4G Long-Term Evolution (LTE) network, while also \nbuilding our next generation 5G network. We are densifying our networks by utilizing small cell technology, in-building solutions \nand distributed antenna systems. Network densification enables us to add capacity to address increasing mobile video \nconsumption and the growing demand for IoT products and services on our 4G LTE and 5G networks. Over the past several \nyears, we have been leading the development of 5G wireless technology industry standards and the ecosystems for fixed and \nmobile 5G wireless services. 5G technology enables higher throughput and lower latency than the 4G LTE technology and allows \nour networks to handle more traffic as the number of internet-connected devices grows. In January 2022, we began deploying C-\nBand spectrum, which has been built out to cover approximately 189 million POPs in the U.S. as of December 31, 2022. We \nexpect to continue deploying C-Band spectrum across the continental U.S. as more and more of the spectrum becomes \navailable for our use. We use low and mid-band spectrum and dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS) technology, to allow 5G service \nto run simultaneously with 4G LTE on multiple spectrum bands. With DSS, whenever customers move outside Verizon’s \nmillimeter wave and C-Band coverage areas, their 5G-enabled devices will remain on 5G technology using the lower spectrum \nbands where this network is available. This allows us to more fully and effectively utilize our current spectrum resources to serve \nboth 4G and 5G customers. \nTo compensate for the shrinking market for traditional copper-based products, we continue to build fiber-based networks \nsupporting data, video and advanced business services - areas where demand for reliable high-speed connections is growing. \nWe are transforming the architecture of our networks into our Intelligent Edge Network, providing improved efficiency and \nvirtualization, increased automation and opportunities for edge computing services that will support our fiber-based and radio \na",

We face competition from other communications and technology companies seeking to \nincrease their brand recognition and capture customer revenue with respect to the provision of wireless products and services, in \naddition to non-traditional offerings in mobile data. For example, Microsoft Corporation, Alphabet Inc., Apple Inc., Meta Platforms, \nInc. and others are offering alternative means for messaging and making wireless voice calls that, in certain cases, can be used \nin lieu of the wireless providers' voice service, as well as alternative means of accessing video content. In addition, we expect to \nsee increasing competition in the provisioning of internet access by low Earth orbit satellite companies as well in the area of fixed \nwireless offerings that provide an alternative to traditional landline internet service providers. \nWith respect to wireless services and equipment, pricing plays an increasingly important role in the wireless competitive \nlandscape.

A securities rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization. Each rating \nshould be evaluated independently of any other rating. \nCovenants \nOur credit agreements contain covenants that are typical for large, investment grade companies. These covenants include \nrequirements to pay interest and principal in a timely fashion, pay taxes, maintain insurance with responsible and reputable \ninsurance companies, preserve our corporate existence, keep appropriate books and records of financial transactions, maintain \nour properties, provide financial and other reports to our lenders, limit pledging and disposition of assets and mergers and \nconsolidations, and other similar covenants. \nWe and our consolidated subsidiaries are in compliance with all of our restrictive covenants in our debt agreements. \nChange In Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash \nOur Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2022 totaled $2.6 billion, a $316 million decrease compared to December 31, \n2021, primarily as a result of the factors discussed above. \nRestricted cash at December 31, 2022 totaled $1.5 billion, a $266 million increase compared to restricted cash at December 31, \n2021, primarily related to cash collections on certain receivables that are required at certain specified times to be placed into \nsegregated accounts. The increase was primarily driven by the completion of asset-backed debt transactions during the year \nended December 31, 2022. \nFree Cash Flow \nFree cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that reflects an additional way of viewing our liquidity that, we believe, when \nviewed with our GAAP results, provides management, investors and other users of our financial information with a more \ncomplete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows. Free cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital \nexpenditures (including capitalized software) from net cash provided by operating activities. We believe it is a more conservative \nmeasure of cash flow since capital expenditures are necessary for ongoing operations.

These plans primarily \nrelate to our domestic business units. We made no discretionary contribution to our qualified pension plan in either 2022 or 2021. \nDuring 2022 and 2021, we made contributions of $53 million and $58 million to our nonqualified pension plans, respectively. \nOur overall investment strategy is to achieve a mix of assets that allows us to meet projected benefit payments while taking into \nconsideration risk and return. In an effort to reduce the risk of our portfolio strategy and better align assets with liabilities, we \nhave adopted a liability driven pension strategy that seeks to better match the interest rate sensitivity of the liability hedging \nassets with the interest rate sensitivity of the liability. We expect that the strategy will reduce the likelihood that assets will decline \nat a time when liabilities increase (referred to as liability hedging), with the goal to reduce the risk of underfunding to the plan and \nits participants and beneficiaries. Over time, as the asset allocation shifts to more liability hedging assets, this strategy will \ngenerally result in lower expected asset returns. In 2023, we expect discretionary qualified pension plan contributions to be \napproximately $200 million and nonqualified pension plan contributions to be insignificant. \nContributions to our other postretirement benefit plans generally relate to payments for benefits on an as-incurred basis since \nthese other postretirement benefit plans do not have funding requirements similar to the pension plans. We contributed $692 \nmillion and $885 million to our other postretirement benefit plans in 2022 and 2021, respectively.

We believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable and represent \nappropriate marketplace considerations as of the valuation date. Although we use consistent methodologies in developing the \nassumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations used in our impairment tests, these estimates and assumptions \nare uncertain by nature, may change over time and can vary from actual results. It is possible that in the future there may be \nchanges in our estimates and assumptions, including the timing and amount of future cash flows, margins, growth rates, market \nparticipant assumptions, comparable benchmark companies and related multiples and discount rates, which could result in \ndifferent fair value estimates. Significant and adverse changes to any one or more of the above-noted estimates and \nassumptions could result in an impairment to our wireless licenses and goodwill impairment for one or more of our reporting \nunits.\n   43 \n \n            Verizon 202",

We aggregate our \nwireless licenses into one single unit of accounting, as we utilize our wireless licenses on an integrated basis as part of our \nnationwide wireless network. Our wireless licenses provide us with the exclusive right to utilize certain radio frequency spectrum \nto provide wireless communication services. There are currently no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other \nfactors that limit the useful life of our wireless licenses. \nWe test our wireless licenses for potential impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. We have \nthe option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment \ntest. However, we may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment in any period and proceed directly to performing the \nquantitative impairment test. It is our policy to perform quantitative impairment assessment at least every three years. \nDuring the fourth quarter of 2022, we performed a qualitative impairment assessment as our annual impairment test to determine \nwhether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our wireless licenses was less than the carrying amount. As part of our \nqualitative assessment we considered several factors including the business enterprise value of our combined wireless business, \nmacroeconomic conditions (including changes in interest rates and discount rates), industry and market considerations (including \nindustry revenue and EBITDA margin results, projections and recent merger and acquisition activity), the recent and projected \nfinancial performance of our combined wireless business as a whole, as well as other factors including the result of our last \nquantitative assessment. Our annual impairment test in 2022 indicated that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our \nwireless licenses remained above their carrying value and, therefore, did not result in an impairment. \nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, we performed a quantitative impairment assessment, which indicated that the fair value of our \nwireless licenses is substantially in excess of their carrying value and, therefore, did not result in an impairment. Our quantitative \nimpairment assessment consisted of comparing the estimated fair value of our aggregate wireless licenses to the aggregated \ncarrying amount as of the test date. Under our quantitative assessment, we estimated the fair value of our wireless licenses \nusing the Greenfield approach. The Greenfield approach is an income based valuation approach that values the wireless \nlicenses by calculating the cash flow generating potential of a hypothetical start-up company that goes into business with no \nassets except the wireless licenses to be valued.

We considered current and expected future economic conditions, current and expected availability of wireless \nnetwork technology and infrastructure and related equipment and the costs thereof as well as other relevant factors in estimating \nfuture cash flows and profitability.

The market multiples approach incorporated significant judgment involved in the selection of comparable public \ncompany multiples and benchmarks. The selection of companies and multiples was influenced by differences in growth and \nprofitability, and volatility in market prices of peer companies. These valuation inputs are inherently judgmental, and an adverse \nchange in one or a combination of these inputs could trigger a goodwill impairment loss in the future. \nDuring the fourth quarter of 2022, we performed a qualitative impairment assessment for our Consumer reporting unit. Our \nqualitative assessment indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our Consumer reporting unit exceeded its \ncarrying value and, therefore, did not result in an impairment. \nDuring the fourth quarter of 2022, we performed a quantitative impairment assessment for our Business reporting unit given it \nhas continued to experience increased market pressures resulting in lower than expected revenues and earnings that may \ncontinue to persist over the near term.

Such a decline could be driven by, among other things: (1) decreases in sales \nvolumes or long-term growth rate as a result of competitive pressures or other factors; or (2) the inability to achieve or delays in \nachieving the goals in strategic initiatives. Also, adverse changes to macroeconomic factors, such as increases in long-term \ninterest rates, would also negatively impact the fair value of the reporting unit. \nAt December 31, 2021, the balance of our goodwill was approximately $28.6 billion, of which $21.0 billion was in our Consumer \nreporting unit and $7.5 billion was in our Business reporting unit.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk \nWe are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of business, including the impact of interest rate changes, \nforeign currency exchange rate fluctuations, changes in investment, equity and commodity prices and changes in corporate tax \nrates. We employ risk management strategies, which may include the use of a variety of derivatives including cross currency \nswaps, forward starting interest rate swaps, interest rate swaps, interest rate caps, treasury rate locks and foreign exchange \nforwards. We do not hold derivatives for trading purposes. \nIt is our general policy to enter into interest rate, foreign currency and other derivative transactions only to the extent necessary \nto achieve our desired objectives in optimizing exposure to various market risks. Our objectives include maintaining a mix of fixed \nand variable rate debt to lower borrowing costs within reasonable risk parameters and to protect against earnings and cash flow \nvolatility resulting from changes in market conditions. We do not hedge our market risk exposure in a manner that would \ncompletely eliminate the effect of changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates on our earnings. \nCounterparties to our derivative contracts are major financial institutions with whom we have negotiated derivatives agreements \n(ISDA master agreements) and credit support annex (CSA) agreements which provide rules for collateral exchange.

The impact of \na 100-basis-point change in interest rates affecting our floating rate debt would result in a change in annual interest expense, \nincluding our interest rate swap agreements that are designated as hedges, of approximately $420 million. The interest rates on \nour existing long-term debt obligations are unaffected by changes to our credit ratings. \nCertain of our floating rate debt and certain of our interest rate derivative transactions utilize interest rates that are linked to the \nLondon Inter-Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) as the benchmark rate.

At \nDecember 31, 2022, the Company’s aggregate defined benefit pension obligation was $15.3 billion \nand exceeded the fair value of pension plan assets of $13.7 billion, resulting in an unfunded defined \nbenefit pension obligation of $1.6 billion.

In addition, we involved an actuarial specialist to assist in \nevaluating management’s methodology for determining the discount rate that reflects the maturity and \nduration of the benefit payments and is used to measure the employee benefit obligations. As part of \nthis assessment, we compared the projected cash flows to prior year projections and compared the \ncurrent year benefits paid to the prior year projected cash flows.

The \nimpairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit (calculated using a combination of a \nmarket approach and an income approach) to its carrying amount. \nAuditing management’s goodwill impairment test was complex and highly judgmental due to the \ninherent subjectivity of developing an estimate of the fair value of the reporting unit, which is based on \nassumptions about future conditions, transactions, or events whose outcome is uncertain and will \ntherefore be subject to change over time.

Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies \nDescription of Business \nVerizon Communications Inc. (the Company) is a holding company that, acting through its subsidiaries (together with the \nCompany, collectively, Verizon), is one of the world’s leading providers of communications, technology, information and \nentertainment products and services to consumers, businesses and government entities. With a presence around the world, we \noffer data, video and voice services and solutions on our networks and platforms that are designed to meet customers’ demand \nfor mobility, reliable network connectivity, security and control. \nWe have two reportable segments that we operate and manage as strategic business units - Verizon Consumer Group \n(Consumer) and Verizon Business Group (Business). \nOur Consumer segment provides consumer-focused wireless and wireline communications services and products. Our wireless \nservices are provided across one of the most extensive wireless networks in the United States (U.S.) under the Verizon brand, \nTracFone Wireless, Inc. (TracFone) brands and through wholesale and other arrangements. We also provide fixed wireless \naccess (FWA) broadband through our wireless networks. Our wireline services are provided in nine states in the Mid-Atlantic and \nNortheastern U.S., as well as Washington D.C., over our 100% fiber-optic network through our Verizon Fios product portfolio and \nover a traditional copper-based network to customers who are not served by Fios. Our Consumer segment's wireless and \nwireline products and services are available to our retail customers, as well as resellers that purchase wireless network access \nfrom us on a wholesale basis. \nOur Business segment provides wireless and wireline communications services and products, including data, video and \nconferencing services, corporate networking solutions, security and managed network services, local and long distance voice \nservices and network access to deliver various Internet of Things (IoT) services and products. We also provide FWA broadband \nthrough our wireless networks. We provide these products and services to businesses, government customers and wireless and \nwireline carriers across the U.S. and select products and services to customers around the world. \nConsolidation \nThe method of accounting applied to investments, whether consolidated or equity, involves an evaluation of all significant terms \nof the investments that explicitly grant or suggest evidence of control or influence over the operations of the investee.

Equity method investments \nare included in Investments in unconsolidated businesses in our consolidated balance sheets. All significant intercompany \naccounts and transactions have been eliminated. \nBasis of Presentation \nWe have reclassified certain prior year amounts to conform to the current year presentation. \nUse of Estimates \nWe prepare our financial statements using U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which requires management \nto make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and disclosures. These estimates and assumptions take into \naccount historical and forward-looking factors that the Company believes are reasonable, including but not limited to public \nhealth crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and related economic implications. Actual results could differ significantly from \nthose estimates. \nExamples of significant estimates include the allowance for credit losses, the recoverability of intangible assets, property, plant \nand equipment, and other long-lived assets, the incremental borrowing rate for the lease liability, fair value measurements, \nincluding those related to financial instruments, goodwill, spectrum licenses and intangible assets, unrecognized tax benefits, \nvaluation allowances on tax assets, pension and postretirement benefit obligations, contingencies and the identification and \nvaluation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with business combinations. \nRevenue Recognition \nWe earn revenue from contracts with customers, primarily through the provision of telecommunications and other services and \nthrough the sale of wireless equipment. These services include a variety of communication and connectivity services for our \nConsumer and Business customers including other carriers that use our facilities to provide services to their customers, as well \nas professional and integrated managed services for our large enterprises and government customers.

For wireless service, we recognize revenue \nusing an output method, either as the service allowance units are used or as time elapses, because it reflects the pattern by \nwhich we satisfy our performance obligation through the transfer of service to the customer. Monthly service is generally billed in \nadvance, which results in a contract liability. See Note 2 for additional information. For postpaid plans, where monthly usage \nexceeds the allowance, the overage usage represents options held by the customer for incremental services and the usage-\nbased fee is recognized when the customer exercises the option (typically on a month-to-month basis). \nFor our contracts related to wireline communication and connectivity services, in general, fixed monthly fees for service are billed \none month in advance, which results in a contract liability, and service revenue is recognized over the enforceable contract term \nas the service is rendered, as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the services through network \naccess and usage. While substantially all of our wireline service revenue contracts are the result of providing access to our \nnetworks, revenue from services that are not fixed in amount and, instead, are based on usage are generally billed in arrears and \nrecognized as the usage occurs. \nEquipment \nWe sell wireless devices and accessories under the Verizon brand and other brands. Equipment revenue is generally recognized \nwhen the products are delivered to and accepted by the customer, as this is when control passes to the customer. In addition to \noffering the sale of equipment on a standalone basis, we have two primary offerings through which customers pay for a wireless \ndevice, in connection with a service contract: fixed-term plans and device payment plans. \nUnder a fixed-term plan, the customer is sold the wireless device without any upfront charge or at a discounted price in exchange \nfor entering into a fixed-term service contract (typically for a term of 24 months or less). \nUnder a device payment plan, the customer is sold the wireless device in exchange for a non-interest-bearing installment note, \nwhich is repaid by the customer, typically over a 36-month term, and concurrently enters into a month-to-month contract for \nwireless service. We may offer certain promotions that provide billing credits applied over a specified term, contingent upon the \ncustomer maintaining service. The credits are included in the transaction price, which are allocated to the performance \nobligations based on their relative selling price and are recognized when earned. \nA financing component exists in both our fixed-term plans and device payment plans because the timing of the payment for the \ndevice, which occurs over the contract term, differs from the satisfaction of the performance obligation, which occurs at contract \ninception upon transfer of the d",

We periodically assess, at the contract level, the significance of the \nfinancing component inherent in our fixed-term and device payment plan receivable based on qualitative and quantitative \nconsiderations related to our customer classes. These considerations include assessing the commercial objective of our plans, \nthe term and duration of financing provided, interest rates prevailing in the marketplace, and credit risks of our customer classes, \nall of which impact our selection of appropriate discount rates. Based on current facts and circumstances, we determined that the \nfinancing component in our existing wireless device payments and fixed-term contracts sold through the direct channel is not \nsignificant and therefore is not accounted for separately. See Note 8 for additional information on the interest on equipment \nfinanced on a device payment plan agreement when sold to the customer by an authorized agent in our indirect channel. \nWireless Contracts \nFor our wireless contracts, total contract revenue, which represents the transaction price for wireless service and wireless \nequipment, is allocated between service and equipment revenue based on their estimated standalone selling prices. We \nestimate the standalone selling price of the device or accessory to be its retail price excluding subsidies or conditional purchase \ndiscounts. We estimate the standalone selling price of wireless service to be the price that we offer to customers on month-to-\nmonth contracts that can be cancelled at any time without penalty (i.e., when there is no fixed-term for service) or when service is \nprocured without the concurrent purchase of a wireless device. In addition, we also assess whether the service term is impacted \nby certain legally enforceable rights and obligations in our contract with customers, such as penalties that a customer would have \nto pay to early terminate a fixed-term contract or billing credits that would cease if the month-to-month wireless service is \ncanceled. The assessment of these legally enforceable rights and obligations involves judgment and impacts our determination \nof the transaction price and related disclosures. \nFrom time to time, we may offer certain promotions that provide our customers on device payment plans with the right to upgrade \nto a new device after paying a specified portion of their device payment plan agreement amount and trading in their device in \ngood working order.

The valuations are considered \nLevel 3 fair value measurements due to the use of significant inputs not observable in the market, which include the discount \nrate, royalty rate and amount and timing of future cash flows. \nGoodwill is calculated as the difference between the Acquisition Date fair value of the consideration paid and payable and the fair \nvalue of the net assets acquired, representing future economic benefits that we expect to achieve as a result of the acquisition. \nThe goodwill related to this acquisition is included within the Consumer segment. \nPursuant to the TracFone Purchase Agreement, América Móvil agreed to indemnify Verizon against certain pre-acquisition tax \nmatters and other contingencies. We have recorded total contingent liabilities and offsetting indemnification assets of \n$672 million for the expected reimbursement of these matters that had not been resolved as of the Acquisition Date. The \nliabilities are presented in Other liabilities and the indemnification assets are presented in Other assets, within our consolidated \nbalance sheets. The amounts recognized represent reasonable estimates based on an evaluation of current facts and \ncircumstances. Actual outcome may differ significantly from these estimates. We expect that any additional liabilities that may \narise related to these indemnified matters would be indemnified and reimbursed by América Móvil. \nBluegrass Cellular \nIn October 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire certain assets of Bluegrass Cellular, a rural wireless operator \nserving central Kentucky.

Verizon’s experience has \nbeen that the payment attributes of longer tenured customers are highly predictive for estimating their reliability to make future \npayments. Customers with longer tenures tend to exhibit similar risk characteristics to other customers with longer tenures, and \nreceivables due from customers with longer tenures tend to perform better than receivables from customers that have not \npreviously been Verizon customers.

The custom credit risk score is generated automatically from the applicant’s credit data using \nproprietary custom credit models. The credit risk score measures the likelihood that the potential customer will become severely \ndelinquent and be disconnected for non-payment. For a small portion of short-tenured customer applications, a traditional credit \nreport is not available from one of the national credit reporting agencies because the potential customer does not have sufficient \ncredit history. In those instances, alternative credit data is used for the risk assessment. For Business customers, we also verify \nthe existence of the business with external data sources. \nBased on the custom credit risk score, we assign each customer a credit class, each of which has specified offers of credit.

Stock-Based Compensation \nVerizon Long-Term Incentive Plan \nIn May 2017, our shareholders approved the 2017 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 2017 Plan) and terminated the Company's \nauthority to grant new awards under the Verizon 2009 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 2009 Plan). The 2017 Plan provides for \nbroad-based equity grants to employees, including executive officers, and permits the granting of stock options, stock \nappreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance stock units and other awards. Upon \nVerizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K                                90 \n\n\napproval of the 2017 Plan, we reserved for issuance under the 2017 Plan the number of shares that were remaining but not \nissued under the 2009 Plan. Shares subject to outstanding awards under the 2009 Plan that expire, are canceled or otherwise \nterminated will also be available for awards under the 2017 Plan. As of December 31, 2022, 69 million shares are reserved for \nfuture issuance under the 2017 Plan. \nRestricted Stock Units \nRestricted Stock Units (RSUs) granted under the 2017 Plan generally vest in three equal installments on each anniversary of the \ngrant date. The RSUs that are paid in stock upon vesting and are thus classified as equity awards are measured using the grant \ndate fair value of Verizon common stock and are not remeasured at the end of each reporting period. The RSUs that are settled \nin cash are classified as liability awards and the liability is measured at its fair value at the end of each reporting period. All RSUs \ngranted under the 2017 Plan have dividend equivalent units (DEUs), which will be paid to participants if, and only to the extent \nthe applicable RSU award vests, and is paid at the time the RSU award is paid, and in the same proportion as the RSU award. In \n2020, Verizon announced a broad-based program that provides for the annual award of cash-settled RSUs under the 2017 Plan \nto all full-time and part-time employees who meet eligibility requirements. \nWe estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those \nestimates. We use historical data to estimate forfeitures and recognize that estimated compensation cost of restricted stock \nunits, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. \nPerformance Stock Units \nThe 2017 Plan also provides for grants of Performance Stock Units (PSUs) that generally vest at the end of the third year after \nthe grant.

The \ncarrying value of cash equivalents approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these investments. \nInvestments in securities traded on national and foreign securities exchanges are valued by the trustee at the last reported sale \nprices on the last business day of the year or, if no sales were reported on that date, at the last reported bid prices. Government \nobligations, corporate bonds, international bonds and asset-backed debt are valued using matrix prices with input from \nindependent third-party valuation sources. Over-the-counter securities are valued at the bid prices or the average of the bid and \nask prices on the last business day of the year from published sources or, if not available, from other sources considered reliable \nsuch as multiple broker quotes. \nCommingled funds not traded on national exchanges are priced by the custodian or fund's administrator at their net asset value \n(NAV). Commingled funds held by third-party custodians appointed by the fund managers provide the fund managers with a NAV. \nThe fund managers have the responsibility for providing this information to the custodian of the respective plan. \nThe investment manager of the entity values venture capital, corporate finance and natural resource limited partnership \ninvestments. Real estate investments are valued at amounts based upon appraisal reports prepared by either independent real \nestate appraisers or the investment manager using discounted cash flows or market comparable data. Loans secured by \nmortgages are carried at the lesser of the unpaid balance or appraised value of the underlying properties. The values assigned \nto these investments are based upon available and current market information and do not necessarily represent amounts that \nmight ultimately be realized. Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, estimated fair values might differ significantly from \nthe values that would have been used had a ready market for the securities existed. These differences could be material. \nForward currency contracts, futures, and options are valued by the trustee at the exchange rates and market prices prevailing on \nthe last business day of the year. Both exchange rates and market prices are readily available from published sources. These \nsecurities are classified by the asset",

Commitments and Contingencies \nIn the ordinary course of business, Verizon is involved in various commercial litigation and regulatory proceedings at the state \nand federal level. Where it is determined, in consultation with counsel based on litigation and settlement risks, that a loss is \nprobable and estimable in a given matter, Verizon establishes an accrual.

An estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss in excess of the amounts already accrued \ncannot be made at this time due to various factors typical in contested proceedings, including: (1) uncertain damage theories and \ndemands; (2) a less than complete factual record; (3) uncertainty concerning legal theories and their resolution by courts or \nregulators; and (4) the unpredictable nature of the opposing party and its demands.

These cases have progressed to various \nstages and a small number may go to trial in the coming 12 months if they are not otherwise resolved. \nIn connection with the execution of agreements for the sales of businesses and investments, Verizon ordinarily provides \nrepresentations and warranties to the purchasers pertaining to a variety of nonfinancial matters, such as ownership of the \nsecurities being sold, as well as indemnity from certain financial losses. From time to time, counterparties may make claims \nunder these provisions, and Verizon will seek to defend against those claims and resolve them in the ordinary course of \nbusiness. \nAs of December 31, 2022, letters of credit totaling approximately $834 million, which were executed in the normal course of \nbusiness and support several financing arrangements and payment obligations to third parties, were outstanding. \nDuring 2022, Verizon entered into four renewable energy purchase agreements (REPAs) with third parties, in addition to 20 \nsigned in previous years. Each of the REPAs is based on the expected operation of a renewable energy-generating facility and \nhas a fixed price term of 12 to 18 years from the commencement of the facility's entry into commercial operation. Seven of the \nfacilities have entered into commercial operation, and the remainder are under development. The REPAs generally are expected \nto be financially settled based on the prevailing market price as energy is generated by the facilities. \nWe have various unconditional purchase obligations, which represent agreements to purchase goods or services that are \nenforceable and legally binding. We estimate that these unconditional purchase obligations, for contracts with terms in excess of \none year, total $24.5 billion, and primarily represent commitments to purchase network equipment, software and services, \ncontent, marketing services and other items which will be used or sold in the ordinary course of business from a variety of \nsuppliers. Of this total amount, $9.4 billion is attributable to 2023, $6.9 billion is attributable to 2024, $5.5 billion is attributable to \n2025, $1.4 billion is attributable to 2026, $772 million is attributable to 2027 and $524 million is attributable to years thereafter. \nThese amounts do not represent our entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items that are the \nVerizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K                                106 \n\n\nsubject of contractual obligations.

Controls and Procedures \nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures \nOur Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant’s disclosure controls \nand procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), as of the end of the \nperiod covered by this Annual Report, that ensure that information relating to the registrant which is required to be disclosed in \nthis report is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within required time periods using the criteria for effective internal \ncontrol established in Internal Control–Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the \nTreadway Commission in 2013. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded \nthat the registrant’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2022. \nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting \nIn the ordinary course of business, we routinely review our system of internal control over financial reporting and make changes \nto our systems and processes that are intended to ensure an effective internal control environment. In the third quarter of 2020, \nwe began a multi-year implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, which will replace many of \nour existing core financial systems. The new ERP system is designed to enhance the flow of financial information, facilitate data \nanalysis and accelerate information reporting. The implementation is expected to occur in phases over the next several years. \nAs the phased implementation of the new ERP system continues, we could have changes to our processes and procedures \nwhich, in turn, could result in changes to our internal controls over financial reporting. As such changes occur, we will evaluate \nquarterly whether such changes materially affect our internal control over financial reporting. \nThere were no changes in Verizon's internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter 2022 that have materially \naffected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. \nManagement's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting \nThe management of Verizon Communications Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over \nfinancial reporting of Verizon.

With respect to wireless services and equipment, pricing plays an increasingly important role in the wireless \ncompetitive landscape. As the demand for wireless services continues to grow, wireless service providers are offering a \nrange of service plans at competitive prices. Many wireless service providers also bundle wireless service offerings with \nother content and offer promotional pricing and incentives, some of which may be targeted specifically to customers of \nVerizon. We and other wireless service providers, as well as equipment manufacturers, offer device payment options, \nwhich provide customers with the ability to pay for their device over a period of time, and some providers offer device \nleasing arrangements.  In addition, aggressive device promotions have become more common in an effort to gain a \ngreater share of subscribers interested in changing carriers as well as retaining existing customers. Pricing also plays \nan important role in the wireline competitive landscape, as traditional service providers compete aggressively in \nofferings such as IP Networking, Core Voice and other legacy products.

We believe that high-quality customer service is a key factor in retaining customers and attracting \nnew customers, including those of other providers. Our customer service, retention and satisfaction programs are based \non providing customers with convenient and easy-to-use products and services and focusing on their needs in order to \npromote long-term relationships and minimize churn. \nCustomer service is highly valued by our Business customers.

Features \nsuch as wireless and wireline inter-operability are becoming increasingly important, driven by both customer demand \nand technological advancement. \n• \nSales and distribution. A key to achieving sales success in the consumer and small and medium business sectors of the \nwireless industry is the reach and quality of sales channels and distribution points. We seek to optimally vary distribution \nchannels among our company-operated stores selling wireless products and services, web-based sales and fulfillment \ncapabilities, outside sales teams and telemarketing, our extensive indirect distribution network of retail outlets and our \nsale of wireless service to resellers, which resell wireless services to their end users. \nIn addition to these competitive factors and trends, our competitive position also depends on our ability to market our products \nand services effectively, anticipate and respond to various factors and trends affecting our industries, as well as the availability of \ncapital resources. \nCompanies with a global presence are increasingly competing with us in our Business segment. A relatively small number of \ntelecommunications and integrated service providers with global operations serve customers in the global enterprise market and, \nto a lesser extent, the global wholesale market.

In addition, mobile video and \ndata needs are driving a greater need for wireless backhaul. Network providers, cable companies and niche players are \ncompetitors for this business opportunity. \nRegulatory Trends \nRegulatory Landscape \nVerizon operates in a regulated and highly competitive market, as described above. Some of our competitors are subject to fewer \nregulatory constraints than Verizon. For many services offered by Verizon, the FCC is our primary regulator. The FCC has \njurisdiction over interstate telecommunications services and other matters under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended \n(Communications Act or Act). Other Verizon services are subject to state and local regulation.\nVerizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K                                10 \n\n\nFederal, State and Local Regulation \nWireless Services \nThe FCC regulates several aspects of our wireless operations. Generally, the FCC has jurisdiction over the construction, \noperation, acquisition and transfer of wireless communications systems. All wireless services require use of radio frequency \nspectrum, the assignment and distribution of which is subject to FCC oversight. If demand continues to increase or if new \nspectrum is required for a future generation of technology, we can meet our needs for licensed spectrum by purchasing licenses \nor leasing spectrum from others, or by participating in a competitive bidding process to acquire new spectrum from the FCC. \nThose processes are subject to certain reviews, approvals and potential conditions. \nToday, Verizon holds FCC spectrum licenses that allow it to provide a wide range of mobile and fixed communications services, \nincluding both voice and data services. FCC spectrum licenses typically have a term of 10 years, at which time they are subject \nto renewal. While the FCC has routinely renewed all of Verizon’s wireless licenses, challenges could be raised in the future. If a \nwireless license was revoked or not renewed, Verizon would not be permitted to provide services on the spectrum covered by \nthat license. Some of our licenses require us to comply with so-called \"open access\" FCC regulations, which generally require \nlicensees of particular spectrum to allow customers to use devices and applications of their choice, subject to certain technical \nlimitations. The FCC has also imposed certain specific mandates on wireless carriers, including construction and geographic \ncoverage requirements, technical operatin",

For example, some states \nimpose reporting and consumer protection requirements. Several states also have laws or regulations that address safety issues \n(for example, use of wireless handsets while driving), universal service funding, and taxation matters. Some states are also \nconsidering new network reliability or service quality requirements that may affect how and where we provide services if not \npreempted by federal law. In addition, wireless tower and antenna facilities are often subject to state and local zoning and land \nuse regulation, and securing approvals for new or modified facilities is often a lengthy and expensive process. \nBroadband \nVerizon offers many different broadband services. The FCC currently recognizes broadband internet access services as \n\"information services\" subject to a \"light touch\" regulatory approach rather than to the traditional, utilities-style regulations. \nHowever, the FCC could return to a more utilities-style regulation of broadband. Additionally, several states have adopted or are \nconsidering adopting laws or executive orders that would regulate broadband.  Although some of these have been challenged in \ncourt, the ultimate enforceability and effect of these state rules is uncertain. Regardless of regulation, Verizon remains committed \nto the open internet, which provides consumers with competitive choices and unblocked access to lawful websites and content. \nOur broadband commitment can be found on our website at https://www.verizon.com/about/our-company/verizon-broadband-\ncommitment. \nWireline Voice \nVerizon offers many different wireline voice services, including traditional telephone service and other services that rely on \ntechnologies such as VoIP. For regulatory purposes, legacy telephone services are generally considered to be \"common carrier\" \nservices. Common carrier services are subject to heightened regulatory oversight with respect to rates, terms and conditions and \nother aspects of the services. The FCC has not decided the regulatory classification of VoIP but has said VoIP service providers \nmust comply with certain rules, such as 911 capabilities and law enforcement assistance requirements. \nState public utility commissions regulate Verizon’s telephone operations with respect to certain telecommunications intrastate \nmatters. Verizon operates as an \"incumbent local exchange carrier\" in nine states and the District of Columbia.

Some states, including California, impose reporting requirements and are \nconsidering new network reliability or service quality requirements for wireline voice services, including for VoIP. \nVideo \nVerizon offers a multichannel video service that is regulated like traditional cable service. The FCC has a body of rules that apply \nto cable operators, and these rules also generally apply to Verizon. In areas where Verizon offers its facilities-based multichannel \nvideo services, Verizon has been required to obtain a cable franchise from local government entities, or in some cases a state-\nwide franchise, and comply with certain one-time and ongoing obligations as a result. \nPrivacy and Data Security \nWe are subject to local, state, federal, and international laws and regulations relating to privacy and data security that impact all \nparts of our business, including wireline, wireless, broadband and the development and roll out of new products, such as those in \nthe artificial intelligence and IoT space. At the federal level, our business is governed by the FCC or the Federal Trade \nCommission (FTC), depending on the product or service.

Generally, attention to privacy and data security requirements is increasing at all levels of \ngovernment globally, and privacy-related legislation has been introduced or is under consideration in many locations. These \nregulations could have a significant impact on our businesses. \nPublic Safety and Cybersecurity \nThe FCC plays a role in addressing public safety concerns by regulating emergency communications services and mandating \nwidespread availability of both media (broadcast/cable) and wireless emergency alerting services. In response to cyber attacks \nthat have occurred or could occur in the future, however, the FCC or other regulators may attempt to increase regulation of the \ncybersecurity practices of providers. The FCC is also addressing the use by American companies of equipment produced by \ncertain companies deemed to cause potential national security risks. Verizon does not currently use equipment in its networks \nfrom vendors under such restrictions. In addition, due to recent natural disasters, federal and state agencies may attempt to \nimpose regulations to ensure continuity of service during disasters. For example, the FCC adopted rules requiring wireless \nproviders to support roaming on each other’s networks during disasters, and the California Public Utilities Commission has \nimposed regulations relating to back-up power for communications facilities. \nIntercarrier Compensation and Network Access \nThe FCC regulates some of the rates that carriers pay each other for the exchange of voi",

In addition, the wireless industry’s customer growth rate could moderate \nin comparison to historical growth rates, leading to increased competition for customers. Our ability to compete effectively will \ndepend on, among other things, our network quality, capacity and coverage, the pricing of our products and services, the quality \nof our customer service, our development of new and enhanced products and services, the reach and quality of our sales and \ndistribution channels, our ability to market our products and services effectively and our capital resources. It will also depend on \nhow successfully we anticipate and respond to various factors affecting our industries, including new technologies and business \nmodels, changes in consumer preferences and demand for existing services, demographic trends and evolving economic \nconditions, including inflation. If we are not able to respond successfully to these competitive challenges, our results of \noperations and financial condition could be adversely impacted. In addition, a projected sustained decline in a reporting unit's \nrevenues and earnings could have a significant negative impact on its fair value and result in an impairment charge, which could \nhave an adverse impact on our results of operations. \nIf we are not able to take advantage of developments in technology and address changing consumer \ndemand on a timely basis, or if the deployment of our 5G network is delayed or hindered for any reason, we \nVerizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K                                14 \n\n\nmay experience a decline in the demand for our services, be unable to implement our business strategy and \nexperience reduced profits. \nOur industries are rapidly changing as new technologies are developed that offer consumers an array of choices for their \ncommunications needs and allow new entrants into the markets we serve.

During the year ended December 31, 2022, these investments included $23.1 billion for \ncapital expenditures, inclusive of approximately $6.2 billion in C-Band related capital expenditures. See \"Cash Flows Used in \nInvesting Activities\" and \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" for additional information. We believe that our investments aimed at \nexpanding our portfolio of products and services will provide our customers with an efficient, reliable infrastructure for competing \nin the information economy. \nGlobal Network and Technology \nWe are focusing our capital spending on adding capacity and density to our 4G Long-Term Evolution (LTE) network, while also \nbuilding our next generation 5G network. We are densifying our networks by utilizing small cell technology, in-building solutions \nand distributed antenna systems. Network densification enables us to add capacity to address increasing mobile video \nconsumption and the growing demand for IoT products and services on our 4G LTE and 5G networks. Over the past several \nyears, we have been leading the development of 5G wireless technology industry standards and the ecosystems for fixed and \nmobile 5G wireless services. 5G technology enables higher throughput and lower latency than the 4G LTE technology and allows \nour networks to handle more traffic as the number of internet-connected devices grows. In January 2022, we began deploying C-\nBand spectrum, which has been built out to cover approximately 189 million POPs in the U.S. as of December 31, 2022. We \nexpect to continue deploying C-Band spectrum across the continental U.S. as more and more of the spectrum becomes \navailable for our use. We use low and mid-band spectrum and dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS) technology, to allow 5G service \nto run simultaneously with 4G LTE on multiple spectrum bands. With DSS, whenever customers move outside Verizon’s \nmillimeter wave and C-Band coverage areas, their 5G-enabled devices will remain on 5G technology using the lower spectrum \nbands where this network is available. This allows us to more fully and effectively utilize our current spectrum resources to serve \nboth 4G and 5G customers. \nTo compensate for the shrinking market for traditional copper-based products, we continue to build fiber-based networks \nsupporting data, video and advanced business services - areas where demand for reliable high-speed connections is growing. \nWe are transforming the architecture of our networks into our Intelligent Edge Network, providing improved efficiency and \nvirtualization, increased automation and opportunities for edge computing services that will support our fiber-based and radio \na",

We face competition from other communications and technology companies seeking to \nincrease their brand recognition and capture customer revenue with respect to the provision of wireless products and services, in \naddition to non-traditional offerings in mobile data. For example, Microsoft Corporation, Alphabet Inc., Apple Inc., Meta Platforms, \nInc. and others are offering alternative means for messaging and making wireless voice calls that, in certain cases, can be used \nin lieu of the wireless providers' voice service, as well as alternative means of accessing video content. In addition, we expect to \nsee increasing competition in the provisioning of internet access by low Earth orbit satellite companies as well in the area of fixed \nwireless offerings that provide an alternative to traditional landline internet service providers. \nWith respect to wireless services and equipment, pricing plays an increasingly important role in the wireless competitive \nlandscape.

We anticipate cash requirements for our 2023 capital program to be \nbetween $18.25 billion and $19.25 billion, inclusive of the final $1.75 billion of the incremental $10 billion related to our \naccelerated C-Band deployment program. \nContractual Obligations and Commitments \nWe have various contractual obligations and commitments.

Related interest payments are $73.6 billion, of which $5.6 billion, are expected to be due \nwithin the next twelve months. Items included in long-term debt with variable coupon rates exclude unamortized debt \nissuance costs, and are described in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. \n• \nOperating lease obligations of $29.8 billion and Finance lease obligations of $1.8 billion, of which $4.6 billion and \n$586 million, respectively, are expected to be due within the next twelve months.

A securities rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization.

These covenants include \nrequirements to pay interest and principal in a timely fashion, pay taxes, maintain insurance with responsible and reputable \ninsurance companies, preserve our corporate existence, keep appropriate books and records of financial transactions, maintain \nour properties, provide financial and other reports to our lenders, limit pledging and disposition of assets and mergers and \nconsolidations, and other similar covenants. \nWe and our consolidated subsidiaries are in compliance with all of our restrictive covenants in our debt agreements. \nChange In Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash \nOur Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2022 totaled $2.6 billion, a $316 million decrease compared to December 31, \n2021, primarily as a result of the factors discussed above. \nRestricted cash at December 31, 2022 totaled $1.5 billion, a $266 million increase compared to restricted cash at December 31, \n2021, primarily related to cash collections on certain receivables that are required at certain specified times to be placed into \nsegregated accounts.

Free cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital \nexpenditures (including capitalized software) from net cash provided by operating activities. We believe it is a more conservative \nmeasure of cash flow since capital expenditures are necessary for ongoing operations.

These plans primarily \nrelate to our domestic business units. We made no discretionary contribution to our qualified pension plan in either 2022 or 2021. \nDuring 2022 and 2021, we made contributions of $53 million and $58 million to our nonqualified pension plans, respectively. \nOur overall investment strategy is to achieve a mix of assets that allows us to meet projected benefit payments while taking into \nconsideration risk and return. In an effort to reduce the risk of our portfolio strategy and better align assets with liabilities, we \nhave adopted a liability driven pension strategy that seeks to better match the interest rate sensitivity of the liability hedging \nassets with the interest rate sensitivity of the liability. We expect that the strategy will reduce the likelihood that assets will decline \nat a time when liabilities increase (referred to as liability hedging), with the goal to reduce the risk of underfunding to the plan and \nits participants and beneficiaries. Over time, as the asset allocation shifts to more liability hedging assets, this strategy will \ngenerally result in lower expected asset returns. In 2023, we expect discretionary qualified pension plan contributions to be \napproximately $200 million and nonqualified pension plan contributions to be insignificant. \nContributions to our other postretirement benefit plans generally relate to payments for benefits on an as-incurred basis since \nthese other postretirement benefit plans do not have funding requirements similar to the pension plans. We contributed $692 \nmillion and $885 million to our other postretirement benefit plans in 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Both our wireless licenses and goodwill \nare treated as indefinite-lived intangible assets and, therefore are not amortized, but rather are tested for impairment annually in \nthe fourth fiscal quarter, unless there are events requiring an earlier assessment or changes in circumstances during an interim \nperiod suggesting impairment indicators are present. We believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable and represent \nappropriate marketplace considerations as of the valuation date. Although we use consistent methodologies in developing the \nassumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations used in our impairment tests, these estimates and assumptions \nare uncertain by nature, may change over time and can vary from actual results. It is possible that in the future there may be \nchanges in our estimates and assumptions, including the timing and amount of future cash flows, margins, growth rates, market \nparticipant assumptions, comparable benchmark companies and related multiples and discount rates, which could result in \ndifferent fair value estimates. Significant and adverse changes to any one or more of the above-noted estimates and \nassumptions could result in an impairment to our wireless licenses and goodwill impairment for one or more of our reporting \nunits.\n   43 \n \n            Verizon 202",

We aggregate our \nwireless licenses into one single unit of accounting, as we utilize our wireless licenses on an integrated basis as part of our \nnationwide wireless network. Our wireless licenses provide us with the exclusive right to utilize certain radio frequency spectrum \nto provide wireless communication services. There are currently no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other \nfactors that limit the useful life of our wireless licenses. \nWe test our wireless licenses for potential impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. We have \nthe option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment \ntest. However, we may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment in any period and proceed directly to performing the \nquantitative impairment test. It is our policy to perform quantitative impairment assessment at least every three years. \nDuring the fourth quarter of 2022, we performed a qualitative impairment assessment as our annual impairment test to determine \nwhether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our wireless licenses was less than the carrying amount. As part of our \nqualitative assessment we considered several factors including the business enterprise value of our combined wireless business, \nmacroeconomic conditions (including changes in interest rates and discount rates), industry and market considerations (including \nindustry revenue and EBITDA margin results, projections and recent merger and acquisition activity), the recent and projected \nfinancial performance of our combined wireless business as a whole, as well as other factors including the result of our last \nquantitative assessment. Our annual impairment test in 2022 indicated that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our \nwireless licenses remained above their carrying value and, therefore, did not result in an impairment. \nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, we performed a quantitative impairment assessment, which indicated that the fair value of our \nwireless licenses is substantially in excess of their carrying value and, therefore, did not result in an impairment. Our quantitative \nimpairment assessment consisted of comparing the estimated fair value of our aggregate wireless licenses to the aggregated \ncarrying amount as of the test date. Under our quantitative assessment, we estimated the fair value of our wireless licenses \nusing the Greenfield approach. The Greenfield approach is an income based valuation approach that values the wireless \nlicenses by calculating the cash flow generating potential of a hypothetical start-up company that goes into business with no \nassets except the wireless licenses to be valued.

We considered current and expected future economic conditions, current and expected availability of wireless \nnetwork technology and infrastructure and related equipment and the costs thereof as well as other relevant factors in estimating \nfuture cash flows and profitability. The discount rate represented our estimate of the weighted-average cost of capital (WACC), or \nexpected return, that a marketplace participant would have required as of the valuation date.

The market multiples approach incorporated significant judgment involved in the selection of comparable public \ncompany multiples and benchmarks. The selection of companies and multiples was influenced by differences in growth and \nprofitability, and volatility in market prices of peer companies. These valuation inputs are inherently judgmental, and an adverse \nchange in one or a combination of these inputs could trigger a goodwill impairment loss in the future. \nDuring the fourth quarter of 2022, we performed a qualitative impairment assessment for our Consumer reporting unit. Our \nqualitative assessment indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our Consumer reporting unit exceeded its \ncarrying value and, therefore, did not result in an impairment. \nDuring the fourth quarter of 2022, we performed a quantitative impairment assessment for our Business reporting unit given it \nhas continued to experience increased market pressures resulting in lower than expected revenues and earnings that may \ncontinue to persist over the near term.

Such a decline could be driven by, among other things: (1) decreases in sales \nvolumes or long-term growth rate as a result of competitive pressures or other factors; or (2) the inability to achieve or delays in \nachieving the goals in strategic initiatives. Also, adverse changes to macroeconomic factors, such as increases in long-term \ninterest rates, would also negatively impact the fair value of the reporting unit. \nAt December 31, 2021, the balance of our goodwill was approximately $28.6 billion, of which $21.0 billion was in our Consumer \nreporting unit and $7.5 billion was in our Business reporting unit.

The risk of loss is assessed over the contractual life of the receivables and we adjust the historical loss \namounts for current and future conditions based on management’s qualitative considerations. For global enterprise, public sector \nand wholesale wireline receivables, the allowance for credit losses is based on historical write-off experience and individual \ncustomer credit risk, as applicable. We consider multiple factors in determining the allowance as discussed above. \nIf there is a deterioration of our customers’ financial condition or if future actual default rates on receivables in general differ from \nthose currently anticipated, we may have to adjust our allowance for credit losses, which would affect earnings in the period the \nadjustments are made.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk \nWe are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of business, including the impact of interest rate changes, \nforeign currency exchange rate fluctuations, changes in investment, equity and commodity prices and changes in corporate tax \nrates. We employ risk management strategies, which may include the use of a variety of derivatives including cross currency \nswaps, forward starting interest rate swaps, interest rate swaps, interest rate caps, treasury rate locks and foreign exchange \nforwards. We do not hold derivatives for trading purposes. \nIt is our general policy to enter into interest rate, foreign currency and other derivative transactions only to the extent necessary \nto achieve our desired objectives in optimizing exposure to various market risks. Our objectives include maintaining a mix of fixed \nand variable rate debt to lower borrowing costs within reasonable risk parameters and to protect against earnings and cash flow \nvolatility resulting from changes in market conditions. We do not hedge our market risk exposure in a manner that would \ncompletely eliminate the effect of changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates on our earnings. \nCounterparties to our derivative contracts are major financial institutions with whom we have negotiated derivatives agreements \n(ISDA master agreements) and credit support annex (CSA) agreements which provide rules for collateral exchange.

The impact of \na 100-basis-point change in interest rates affecting our floating rate debt would result in a change in annual interest expense, \nincluding our interest rate swap agreements that are designated as hedges, of approximately $420 million. The interest rates on \nour existing long-term debt obligations are unaffected by changes to our credit ratings. \nCertain of our floating rate debt and certain of our interest rate derivative transactions utilize interest rates that are linked to the \nLondon Inter-Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) as the benchmark rate. The U.S. dollar LIBOR rates utilized in these transactions will \ncease publication after June 30, 2023, in accordance with recent U.S. and international regulatory guidance for reform.

At \nDecember 31, 2022, the Company’s aggregate defined benefit pension obligation was $15.3 billion \nand exceeded the fair value of pension plan assets of $13.7 billion, resulting in an unfunded defined \nbenefit pension obligation of $1.6 billion.

In addition, we involved an actuarial specialist to assist in \nevaluating management’s methodology for determining the discount rate that reflects the maturity and \nduration of the benefit payments and is used to measure the employee benefit obligations. As part of \nthis assessment, we compared the projected cash flows to prior year projections and compared the \ncurrent year benefits paid to the prior year projected cash flows. To evaluate the health care cost \ntrends and per capita claims cost trends, we involved an actuarial specialist to assist in evaluating the \nassumptions and assessed whether the information was consistent with publicly available information, \nand whether any market data adjusted for entity-specific adjustments were applied.

As discussed in Notes 1 and 4 of \nthe consolidated financial statements, goodwill is not amortized but rather is tested for impairment at \nthe reporting unit level at least annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. The \nimpairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit (calculated using a combination of a \nmarket approach and an income approach) to its carrying amount. \nAuditing management’s goodwill impairment test was complex and highly judgmental due to the \ninherent subjectivity of developing an estimate of the fair value of the reporting unit, which is based on \nassumptions about future conditions, transactions, or events whose outcome is uncertain and will \ntherefore be subject to change over time.

Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies \nDescription of Business \nVerizon Communications Inc. (the Company) is a holding company that, acting through its subsidiaries (together with the \nCompany, collectively, Verizon), is one of the world’s leading providers of communications, technology, information and \nentertainment products and services to consumers, businesses and government entities. With a presence around the world, we \noffer data, video and voice services and solutions on our networks and platforms that are designed to meet customers’ demand \nfor mobility, reliable network connectivity, security and control. \nWe have two reportable segments that we operate and manage as strategic business units - Verizon Consumer Group \n(Consumer) and Verizon Business Group (Business). \nOur Consumer segment provides consumer-focused wireless and wireline communications services and products. Our wireless \nservices are provided across one of the most extensive wireless networks in the United States (U.S.) under the Verizon brand, \nTracFone Wireless, Inc. (TracFone) brands and through wholesale and other arrangements. We also provide fixed wireless \naccess (FWA) broadband through our wireless networks. Our wireline services are provided in nine states in the Mid-Atlantic and \nNortheastern U.S., as well as Washington D.C., over our 100% fiber-optic network through our Verizon Fios product portfolio and \nover a traditional copper-based network to customers who are not served by Fios. Our Consumer segment's wireless and \nwireline products and services are available to our retail customers, as well as resellers that purchase wireless network access \nfrom us on a wholesale basis. \nOur Business segment provides wireless and wireline communications services and products, including data, video and \nconferencing services, corporate networking solutions, security and managed network services, local and long distance voice \nservices and network access to deliver various Internet of Things (IoT) services and products. We also provide FWA broadband \nthrough our wireless networks. We provide these products and services to businesses, government customers and wireless and \nwireline carriers across the U.S. and select products and services to customers around the world. \nConsolidation \nThe method of accounting applied to investments, whether consolidated or equity, involves an evaluation of all significant terms \nof the investments that explicitly grant or suggest evidence of control or influence over the operations of the investee.

For controlled subsidiaries that are not wholly-owned, the noncontrolling interests are \nincluded in Net income and Total equity.

Equity method investments \nare included in Investments in unconsolidated businesses in our consolidated balance sheets. All significant intercompany \naccounts and transactions have been eliminated. \nBasis of Presentation \nWe have reclassified certain prior year amounts to conform to the current year presentation. \nUse of Estimates \nWe prepare our financial statements using U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which requires management \nto make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and disclosures. These estimates and assumptions take into \naccount historical and forward-looking factors that the Company believes are reasonable, including but not limited to public \nhealth crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and related economic implications. Actual results could differ significantly from \nthose estimates. \nExamples of significant estimates include the allowance for credit losses, the recoverability of intangible assets, property, plant \nand equipment, and other long-lived assets, the incremental borrowing rate for the lease liability, fair value measurements, \nincluding those related to financial instruments, goodwill, spectrum licenses and intangible assets, unrecognized tax benefits, \nvaluation allowances on tax assets, pension and postretirement benefit obligations, contingencies and the identification and \nvaluation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with business combinations. \nRevenue Recognition \nWe earn revenue from contracts with customers, primarily through the provision of telecommunications and other services and \nthrough the sale of wireless equipment. These services include a variety of communication and connectivity services for our \nConsumer and Business customers including other carriers that use our facilities to provide services to their customers, as well \nas professional and integrated managed services for our large enterprises and government customers.

For wireless service, we recognize revenue \nusing an output method, either as the service allowance units are used or as time elapses, because it reflects the pattern by \nwhich we satisfy our performance obligation through the transfer of service to the customer. Monthly service is generally billed in \nadvance, which results in a contract liability. See Note 2 for additional information. For postpaid plans, where monthly usage \nexceeds the allowance, the overage usage represents options held by the customer for incremental services and the usage-\nbased fee is recognized when the customer exercises the option (typically on a month-to-month basis). \nFor our contracts related to wireline communication and connectivity services, in general, fixed monthly fees for service are billed \none month in advance, which results in a contract liability, and service revenue is recognized over the enforceable contract term \nas the service is rendered, as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the services through network \naccess and usage. While substantially all of our wireline service revenue contracts are the result of providing access to our \nnetworks, revenue from services that are not fixed in amount and, instead, are based on usage are generally billed in arrears and \nrecognized as the usage occurs. \nEquipment \nWe sell wireless devices and accessories under the Verizon brand and other brands. Equipment revenue is generally recognized \nwhen the products are delivered to and accepted by the customer, as this is when control passes to the customer. In addition to \noffering the sale of equipment on a standalone basis, we have two primary offerings through which customers pay for a wireless \ndevice, in connection with a service contract: fixed-term plans and device payment plans. \nUnder a fixed-term plan, the customer is sold the wireless device without any upfront charge or at a discounted price in exchange \nfor entering into a fixed-term service contract (typically for a term of 24 months or less). \nUnder a device payment plan, the customer is sold the wireless device in exchange for a non-interest-bearing installment note, \nwhich is repaid by the customer, typically over a 36-month term, and concurrently enters into a month-to-month contract for \nwireless service. We may offer certain promotions that provide billing credits applied over a specified term, contingent upon the \ncustomer maintaining service. The credits are included in the transaction price, which are allocated to the performance \nobligations based on their relative selling price and are recognized when earned. \nA financing component exists in both our fixed-term plans and device payment plans because the timing of the payment for the \ndevice, which occurs over the contract term, differs from the satisfaction of the performance obligation, which occurs at contract \ninception upon transfer of the d",

We periodically assess, at the contract level, the significance of the \nfinancing component inherent in our fixed-term and device payment plan receivable based on qualitative and quantitative \nconsiderations related to our customer classes. These considerations include assessing the commercial objective of our plans, \nthe term and duration of financing provided, interest rates prevailing in the marketplace, and credit risks of our customer classes, \nall of which impact our selection of appropriate discount rates. Based on current facts and circumstances, we determined that the \nfinancing component in our existing wireless device payments and fixed-term contracts sold through the direct channel is not \nsignificant and therefore is not accounted for separately. See Note 8 for additional information on the interest on equipment \nfinanced on a device payment plan agreement when sold to the customer by an authorized agent in our indirect channel. \nWireless Contracts \nFor our wireless contracts, total contract revenue, which represents the transaction price for wireless service and wireless \nequipment, is allocated between service and equipment revenue based on their estimated standalone selling prices. We \nestimate the standalone selling price of the device or accessory to be its retail price excluding subsidies or conditional purchase \ndiscounts. We estimate the standalone selling price of wireless service to be the price that we offer to customers on month-to-\nmonth contracts that can be cancelled at any time without penalty (i.e., when there is no fixed-term for service) or when service is \nprocured without the concurrent purchase of a wireless device. In addition, we also assess whether the service term is impacted \nby certain legally enforceable rights and obligations in our contract with customers, such as penalties that a customer would have \nto pay to early terminate a fixed-term contract or billing credits that would cease if the month-to-month wireless service is \ncanceled. The assessment of these legally enforceable rights and obligations involves judgment and impacts our determination \nof the transaction price and related disclosures. \nFrom time to time, we may offer certain promotions that provide our customers on device payment plans with the right to upgrade \nto a new device after paying a specified portion of their device payment plan agreement amount and trading in their device in \ngood working order.

The valuations are considered \nLevel 3 fair value measurements due to the use of significant inputs not observable in the market, which include the discount \nrate, royalty rate and amount and timing of future cash flows. \nGoodwill is calculated as the difference between the Acquisition Date fair value of the consideration paid and payable and the fair \nvalue of the net assets acquired, representing future economic benefits that we expect to achieve as a result of the acquisition. \nThe goodwill related to this acquisition is included within the Consumer segment. \nPursuant to the TracFone Purchase Agreement, América Móvil agreed to indemnify Verizon against certain pre-acquisition tax \nmatters and other contingencies. We have recorded total contingent liabilities and offsetting indemnification assets of \n$672 million for the expected reimbursement of these matters that had not been resolved as of the Acquisition Date. The \nliabilities are presented in Other liabilities and the indemnification assets are presented in Other assets, within our consolidated \nbalance sheets. The amounts recognized represent reasonable estimates based on an evaluation of current facts and \ncircumstances. Actual outcome may differ significantly from these estimates. We expect that any additional liabilities that may \narise related to these indemnified matters would be indemnified and reimbursed by América Móvil. \nBluegrass Cellular \nIn October 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire certain assets of Bluegrass Cellular, a rural wireless operator \nserving central Kentucky.

Verizon’s experience has \nbeen that the payment attributes of longer tenured customers are highly predictive for estimating their reliability to make future \npayments. Customers with longer tenures tend to exhibit similar risk characteristics to other customers with longer tenures, and \nreceivables due from customers with longer tenures tend to perform better than receivables from customers that have not \npreviously been Verizon customers.

The custom credit risk score is generated automatically from the applicant’s credit data using \nproprietary custom credit models. The credit risk score measures the likelihood that the potential customer will become severely \ndelinquent and be disconnected for non-payment. For a small portion of short-tenured customer applications, a traditional credit \nreport is not available from one of the national credit reporting agencies because the potential customer does not have sufficient \ncredit history. In those instances, alternative credit data is used for the risk assessment. For Business customers, we also verify \nthe existence of the business with external data sources. \nBased on the custom credit risk score, we assign each customer a credit class, each of which has specified offers of credit.

Stock-Based Compensation \nVerizon Long-Term Incentive Plan \nIn May 2017, our shareholders approved the 2017 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 2017 Plan) and terminated the Company's \nauthority to grant new awards under the Verizon 2009 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 2009 Plan). The 2017 Plan provides for \nbroad-based equity grants to employees, including executive officers, and permits the granting of stock options, stock \nappreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance stock units and other awards. Upon \nVerizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K                                90 \n\n\napproval of the 2017 Plan, we reserved for issuance under the 2017 Plan the number of shares that were remaining but not \nissued under the 2009 Plan. Shares subject to outstanding awards under the 2009 Plan that expire, are canceled or otherwise \nterminated will also be available for awards under the 2017 Plan. As of December 31, 2022, 69 million shares are reserved for \nfuture issuance under the 2017 Plan. \nRestricted Stock Units \nRestricted Stock Units (RSUs) granted under the 2017 Plan generally vest in three equal installments on each anniversary of the \ngrant date. The RSUs that are paid in stock upon vesting and are thus classified as equity awards are measured using the grant \ndate fair value of Verizon common stock and are not remeasured at the end of each reporting period. The RSUs that are settled \nin cash are classified as liability awards and the liability is measured at its fair value at the end of each reporting period. All RSUs \ngranted under the 2017 Plan have dividend equivalent units (DEUs), which will be paid to participants if, and only to the extent \nthe applicable RSU award vests, and is paid at the time the RSU award is paid, and in the same proportion as the RSU award. In \n2020, Verizon announced a broad-based program that provides for the annual award of cash-settled RSUs under the 2017 Plan \nto all full-time and part-time employees who meet eligibility requirements. \nWe estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those \nestimates. We use historical data to estimate forfeitures and recognize that estimated compensation cost of restricted stock \nunits, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. \nPerformance Stock Units \nThe 2017 Plan also provides for grants of Performance Stock Units (PSUs) that generally vest at the end of the third year after \nthe grant.

The \ncarrying value of cash equivalents approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these investments. \nInvestments in securities traded on national and foreign securities exchanges are valued by the trustee at the last reported sale \nprices on the last business day of the year or, if no sales were reported on that date, at the last reported bid prices. Government \nobligations, corporate bonds, international bonds and asset-backed debt are valued using matrix prices with input from \nindependent third-party valuation sources. Over-the-counter securities are valued at the bid prices or the average of the bid and \nask prices on the last business day of the year from published sources or, if not available, from other sources considered reliable \nsuch as multiple broker quotes. \nCommingled funds not traded on national exchanges are priced by the custodian or fund's administrator at their net asset value \n(NAV). Commingled funds held by third-party custodians appointed by the fund managers provide the fund managers with a NAV. \nThe fund managers have the responsibility for providing this information to the custodian of the respective plan. \nThe investment manager of the entity values venture capital, corporate finance and natural resource limited partnership \ninvestments. Real estate investments are valued at amounts based upon appraisal reports prepared by either independent real \nestate appraisers or the investment manager using discounted cash flows or market comparable data. Loans secured by \nmortgages are carried at the lesser of the unpaid balance or appraised value of the underlying properties. The values assigned \nto these investments are based upon available and current market information and do not necessarily represent amounts that \nmight ultimately be realized. Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, estimated fair values might differ significantly from \nthe values that would have been used had a ready market for the securities existed. These differences could be material. \nForward currency contracts, futures, and options are valued by the trustee at the exchange rates and market prices prevailing on \nthe last business day of the year. Both exchange rates and market prices are readily available from published sources. These \nsecurities are classified by the asset",

Commitments and Contingencies \nIn the ordinary course of business, Verizon is involved in various commercial litigation and regulatory proceedings at the state \nand federal level. Where it is determined, in consultation with counsel based on litigation and settlement risks, that a loss is \nprobable and estimable in a given matter, Verizon establishes an accrual.

An estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss in excess of the amounts already accrued \ncannot be made at this time due to various factors typical in contested proceedings, including: (1) uncertain damage theories and \ndemands; (2) a less than complete factual record; (3) uncertainty concerning legal theories and their resolution by courts or \nregulators; and (4) the unpredictable nature of the opposing party and its demands.

These cases have progressed to various \nstages and a small number may go to trial in the coming 12 months if they are not otherwise resolved. \nIn connection with the execution of agreements for the sales of businesses and investments, Verizon ordinarily provides \nrepresentations and warranties to the purchasers pertaining to a variety of nonfinancial matters, such as ownership of the \nsecurities being sold, as well as indemnity from certain financial losses. From time to time, counterparties may make claims \nunder these provisions, and Verizon will seek to defend against those claims and resolve them in the ordinary course of \nbusiness. \nAs of December 31, 2022, letters of credit totaling approximately $834 million, which were executed in the normal course of \nbusiness and support several financing arrangements and payment obligations to third parties, were outstanding. \nDuring 2022, Verizon entered into four renewable energy purchase agreements (REPAs) with third parties, in addition to 20 \nsigned in previous years. Each of the REPAs is based on the expected operation of a renewable energy-generating facility and \nhas a fixed price term of 12 to 18 years from the commencement of the facility's entry into commercial operation. Seven of the \nfacilities have entered into commercial operation, and the remainder are under development. The REPAs generally are expected \nto be financially settled based on the prevailing market price as energy is generated by the facilities. \nWe have various unconditional purchase obligations, which represent agreements to purchase goods or services that are \nenforceable and legally binding. We estimate that these unconditional purchase obligations, for contracts with terms in excess of \none year, total $24.5 billion, and primarily represent commitments to purchase network equipment, software and services, \ncontent, marketing services and other items which will be used or sold in the ordinary course of business from a variety of \nsuppliers. Of this total amount, $9.4 billion is attributable to 2023, $6.9 billion is attributable to 2024, $5.5 billion is attributable to \n2025, $1.4 billion is attributable to 2026, $772 million is attributable to 2027 and $524 million is attributable to years thereafter. \nThese amounts do not represent our entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items that are the \nVerizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K                                106 \n\n\nsubject of contractual obligations.

Controls and Procedures \nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures \nOur Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant’s disclosure controls \nand procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), as of the end of the \nperiod covered by this Annual Report, that ensure that information relating to the registrant which is required to be disclosed in \nthis report is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within required time periods using the criteria for effective internal \ncontrol established in Internal Control–Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the \nTreadway Commission in 2013. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded \nthat the registrant’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2022. \nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting \nIn the ordinary course of business, we routinely review our system of internal control over financial reporting and make changes \nto our systems and processes that are intended to ensure an effective internal control environment. In the third quarter of 2020, \nwe began a multi-year implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, which will replace many of \nour existing core financial systems. The new ERP system is designed to enhance the flow of financial information, facilitate data \nanalysis and accelerate information reporting. The implementation is expected to occur in phases over the next several years. \nAs the phased implementation of the new ERP system continues, we could have changes to our processes and procedures \nwhich, in turn, could result in changes to our internal controls over financial reporting. As such changes occur, we will evaluate \nquarterly whether such changes materially affect our internal control over financial reporting. \nThere were no changes in Verizon's internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter 2022 that have materially \naffected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. \nManagement's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting \nThe management of Verizon Communications Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over \nfinancial reporting of Verizon.

We have consistent figures for both 2021 and 2022.\n\n3. **Calculation/Derivation:**\n   - To determine if Verizon increased its debt, we compare the total debt figures for the two years.\n   - 2021 Debt: $150.9 billion\n   - 2022 Debt: $150.6 billion\n   - Since $150.6 billion (2022) is less than $150.9 billion (2021), Verizon's debt decreased from 2021 to 2022.\n\n4. **Conflicting Answers:**\n   - There are some conflicting figures, but the most reliable and frequently cited figures are $150.9 billion for 2021 and $150.6 billion for 2022. These figures are supported by multiple citations, making them the most credible.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the reliable figures gathered, Verizon did not increase its debt on the balance sheet between the 2022 and 2021 fiscal periods. The debt actually decreased slightly from $150.9 billion in 2021 to $150.6 billion in 2022."
