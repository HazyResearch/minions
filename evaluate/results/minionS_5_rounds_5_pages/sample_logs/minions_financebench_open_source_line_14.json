  "correctness_reasoning": "The predicted answer correctly states that Adobe's operating margin did not improve from FY2021 to FY2022, aligning with the ground truth that the margin declined. It also provides additional context about the relevance of operating margin for Adobe, which does not contradict the ground truth. The stance on the operating margin not improving matches the ground truth, fulfilling the evaluation criteria."
