--- Question ---
What is Lockheed Martin's 2 year total revenue CAGR from FY2020 to FY2022 (in units of percents and round to one decimal place)? Provide a response to the question by primarily using the statement of income.

--- Predicted Answer ---
0.0%

--- Ground Truth ---
['0.4%']

--- Correctness Evaluation ---
Is correct: False
Confidence: 0.80
Reasoning: The ground truth answer is 0.4%, and the predicted answer is 0.0%. Applying a 10% tolerance to the ground truth (0.4% ± 0.04%), the acceptable range is 0.36% to 0.44%. The predicted answer of 0.0% falls outside this range, so it is incorrect.
