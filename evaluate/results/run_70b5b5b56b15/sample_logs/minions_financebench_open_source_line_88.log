--- Question ---
Roughly how many times has JnJ sold its inventory in FY2022? Calculate inventory turnover ratio for FY2022; if conventional inventory management is not meaningful for the company then state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
The inventory turnover ratio for JnJ in FY2022 cannot be determined due to the lack of explicit COGS data. The ending inventory was reported as $12,483 million, but without COGS, the turnover ratio cannot be calculated. Conventional inventory management may not be meaningful for JnJ due to its complex business model, which includes a diverse product portfolio and global operations.

--- Ground Truth ---
['JnJ sold its inventory 2.7 times in FY2022.']
