Total length: 825474 characters.: \n\n## Question\nHow much has the effective tax rate of American Express changed between FY2021 and FY2022?\n\n---\n\nPlease provide succinct advice on the critical information we need to extract from the Financial document. Total length: 825474 characters to answer this question. \n\nAlso consider the following constraints:\n- In your response do NOT use numbered lists.\n- Do NOT structure your response as a sequence of steps.\n",
      "output": "To determine the change in the effective tax rate of American Express between FY2021 and FY2022, focus on extracting specific financial data from the document. Look for the sections that detail the income tax expenses and the pre-tax income for both fiscal years. These figures are typically found in the income statement or notes to the financial statements. Calculate the effective tax rate for each year by dividing the income tax expense by the pre-tax income. Compare these rates to identify the change. Additionally, review any management discussion or analysis sections that might provide insights or explanations regarding fluctuations in the tax rate."

      "prompt": "# Decomposition Round #1\n\nYou (the supervisor) cannot directly read the document(s). Instead, you can assign small, isolated tasks to a less capable worker model that sees only a single chunk of text at a time. Any cross-chunk or multi-document reasoning must be handled by you.\n\n## Your Job: Write Two Python Functions\n\n### FUNCTION #1: `prepare_jobs(context, prev_job_manifests, prev_job_outputs) -> List[JobManifest]`\n- Break the document(s) into chunks (using the provided chunking function, if needed). Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 12 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`. All **multi-chunk integration** or **global reasoning** is your responsibility here.\n- Return one **aggregated string** suitable for further supervisor inspection.\n\n\n\n## Relevant Pydantic Models\n\nThe following models are already in the global scope. **Do NOT redefine or re-import them.**\n\n### JobManifest Model\n```\nclass JobManifest(BaseModel):\n    chunk: str  # the actual text for the chunk of the document\n    task: str  # the actual task instruction for the small model\n    advice: str  # optional, any additional advice on how to perform the task\n\n    chunk_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    task_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    job_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n\n```\n\n### JobOutput Model\n```\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    citation: Optional[str]\n    answer: Optional[str]\n\n```\n\n## Function Signatures\n```\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        context (List[str]): A list of documents.

Net income taxes paid were approximately $3.0 billion, and net income is not provided. We can also find the gross deferred tax assets and liabilities for FY2021 and FY2022, which can be used to estimate the effective tax rate. For FY2022, gross deferred tax assets were $5,592 million, and gross deferred tax liabilities were $1,550 million. The effective tax rate for FY2022 can be estimated as (net deferred tax assets / net income) * 100. However, since net income is not provided, we can use the net income taxes paid as a proxy. The effective tax rate for FY2022 can be estimated as (net income taxes paid / net income) * 100.

Those requirements include that each of the Company and AENB must be “well capitalized” and “well managed,” and AENB must have\nreceived at least a “satisfactory” rating on its most recent assessment under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (the CRA). The Company and TRS\nengage in various activities permissible only for financial holding companies, including, in particular, providing travel agency services, acting as a finder and\nengaging in certain insurance underwriting and agency services. If the Company fails to meet eligibility requirements for financial holding company status, it\nand its subsidiaries are likely to be barred from engaging in new types of financial activities or making certain types of acquisitions or investments in reliance\non its status as a financial holding company, and ultimately could be required to either discontinue the broader range of\n11\n\n\nTable of Contents\nactivities permitted to financial holding companies or divest AENB.

These rules are intended\nto ensure that bank holding companies and depository institutions (collectively, banking organizations) have adequate capital given their level of assets and off-\nbalance sheet obligations. The federal banking regulators’ current capital rules (the Capital Rules) implement the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s\n(the Basel Committee) framework for strengthening international capital regulation, known as Basel III. For additional information regarding our capital ratios,\nsee “Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity” under “MD&A.”\nUnder the Capital Rules, banking organizations are required to maintain minimum ratios for Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1 capital), Tier 1 capital (that is,\nCET1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital) and Total capital (that is, Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets. We report our capital adequacy\nratios using risk-weighted assets calculated under the standardized approach. As a Category IV firm, we are not subject to the advanced approaches capital\nrequirements.\nIn December 2017, the Basel Committee published standards that, among other things, revise the standardized approach for credit risk (including by\nrecalibrating risk weights and introducing additional capital requirements for certain “unconditionally cancellable commitments” such as unused credit card\nlines of credit) and provide a new standardized calculation for operational risk capital requirements. In September 2022, federal banking regulators announced\nthat they are reaffirming their commitment to implement enhanced regulatory capital requirements that align with the standards issued by the Basel Committee\nin December 2017 and that they are developing a joint proposed rule for issuance. If adopted in the United States as issued by the Basel Committee and\napplicable to us, the new standards are likely to result in higher capital requirements for us.\n12\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIn December 2018, federal banking regulators issued a final rule that provides an optional three-year phase-in period for the adverse regulatory capital effects\nof adopting the Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) methodology pursuant to new accounting guidance for the recognition of credit losses on certain\nfinancial instruments, which became effective January 1, 2020.

As of January 1, 2023, the Company has phased in 50 percent of such amount.\nSee “Critical Accounting Estimates” under “MD&A” for additional information on CECL.\nThe Company and AENB must each maintain CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios of at least 4.5 percent, 6.0 percent and 8.0 percent,\nrespectively. On top of these minimum capital ratios, the Company is subject to a dynamic stress capital buffer (SCB) composed entirely of CET1 capital with\na floor of 2.5 percent and AENB is subject to a static 2.5 percent capital conservation buffer (CCB). The SCB equals (i) the difference between a bank holding\ncompany’s starting and minimum projected CET1 capital ratios under the supervisory severely adverse scenario under the Federal Reserve's stress tests\ndescribed below, plus (ii) one year of planned common stock dividends as a percentage of risk-weighted assets.\nOn August 4, 2022, the Federal Reserve confirmed the SCB for the Company of 2.5 percent, which remained unchanged from the level announced in June\n2021. As a result, the effective minimum ratios for the Company (taking into account the SCB requirement) and AENB (taking into account the CCB\nrequirement) are 7.0 percent, 8.5 percent and 10.5 percent for the CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios, respectively. Banking organizations\nwhose ratios of CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital or Total capital to risk-weighted assets are below these effective minimum ratios face constraints on discretionary\ndistributions such as dividends, repurchases and redemptions of capital securities, and executive compensation. A bank holding company’s SCB requirement is\neffective on October 1 of each year and will remain in effect through September 30 of the following year unless it is reset in connection with resubmission of a\ncapital plan, as discussed below.\nWe are also required to comply with minimum leverage ratio requirements. The leverage ratio is the ratio of a banking organization’s Tier 1 capital to its\naverage total consolidated assets (as defined for regulatory purposes). All banking organizations are required to maintain a leverage ratio of at least 4.0 percent.\nLiquidity Regulation\nThe Federal Reserve’s enhanced prudential standards rule includes heightened liquidity and overall risk management requirements. The rule requires the\nmaintenance of a liquidity buffer, consisting of highly liquid assets, that is sufficient to meet projected net outflows for 30 days over a range of liquidity stress\nscenarios, and a minimum liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) that measures a firm’s high-quality liquid assets to its projected net outflows.

As part of the\nComprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), the Federal Reserve uses pro-forma capital positions and ratios under such stress scenarios to determine\nthe size of the SCB for each CCAR participating firm.\nAs a Category IV firm, the Company is required to participate in the supervisory stress tests every other year and was most recently subject to the Federal\nReserve’s supervisory stress tests in 2022.

The FDIA establishes five capital categories for FDIC-\ninsured banks: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. The FDIA imposes\nprogressively more restrictive constraints on operations, management and capital distributions, depending on the capital category in which an institution is\nclassified. In order to be considered “well capitalized,” AENB must maintain CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital, Total capital and Tier 1 leverage ratios of 6.5\npercent, 8.0 percent, 10.0 percent and 5.0 percent, respectively.\nUnder the FDIA, AENB could be prohibited from accepting brokered deposits (i.e., deposits raised through third-party brokerage networks) or offering interest\nrates on any deposits significantly higher than the prevailing rate in its normal market area or nationally (depending upon where the deposits are solicited),\nunless (1) it is well capitalized or (2) it is adequately capitalized and receives a waiver from the FDIC. A portion of our outstanding U.S. retail deposits are\nconsidered brokered deposits for bank regulatory purposes.

The CFPB has the authority to write regulations under federal consumer financial protection laws, to enforce those laws\nand to examine for compliance. It is also authorized to collect fines and require consumer restitution in the event of violations, engage in consumer financial\neducation, track consumer complaints, request data and promote the availability of financial services to underserved consumers and communities. In addition, a\nnumber of U.S. states have significant consumer credit protection, disclosure and other laws (in certain cases more stringent than U.S. federal laws). U.S.\nfederal law also regulates abusive debt collection practices, which, along with bankruptcy and debtor relief laws, can affect our ability to collect amounts owed\nto us or subject us to regulatory scrutiny.\nOn February 1, 2023, the CFPB issued a proposed rule to lower the safe harbor amount that would be considered, by regulation, to be “reasonable and\nproportional” to the costs incurred by credit card issuers for late payments. The proposed rule would also eliminate the annual inflation adjustment for such safe\nharbor amount and prohibit late fee amounts above 25 percent of the consumer's required minim",

In addition, the laws\nof a number of states in the United States that prohibit surcharging have been overturned and certain states have passed or are considering laws to permit\nsurcharging by merchants. Effective October 6, 2022, merchants in Canada (other than in Quebec) are now permitted to surcharge credit card purchases up to a\nmaximum of 2.4 percent as a result of a litigation settlement with Visa and Mastercard. Surcharging is an adverse customer experience and could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on us, particularly where it only or disproportionately impacts credit card usage or card usage generally, our Card Members or our\nbusiness. In addition, other steering or differential acceptance practices that are permitted by regulation in some jurisdictions could also have a material adverse\neffect on us. See “Surcharging or steering by merchants could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations” under “Risk Factors.”\nIn some countries, governments have established regulatory regimes that require international card networks to be locally licensed and/or to localize aspects of\ntheir operations. For example, the Reserve Bank of India, which has broad power under the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007 to regulate the\nmembership and operations of card networks, issued a mandate requiring payment systems operators in India to store certain payments data locally. In 2021, it\nimposed restrictions on American Express Banking Corp. from engaging in certain card issuing activities in India, which were lifted in August 2022 following\nsignificant investment in technology, infrastructure and resources to comply with the regulation.

The Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 (the AMLA), enacted in January 2021, amended the Bank Secrecy Act and is intended to\ncomprehensively reform and modernize U.S. AML/CFT laws. Many of the statutory provisions in the AMLA will require additional rulemakings, reports and\nother measures, the effects of which are not known at this time.\nIn Europe, AML/CFT requirements are largely the result of countries transposing the 5th and 6th EU Anti-Money Laundering Directives (and preceding EU\nAnti-Money Laundering Directives) into local laws and regulations.

The federal banking regulators’ guidance on sound incentive\ncompensation practices sets forth three key principles for incentive compensation arrangements that are designed to help ensure that incentive compensation\nplans do not encourage imprudent risk-taking and are consistent with the safety and soundness of banking organizations. The three principles provide that a\nbanking organization’s incentive compensation arrangements should (1) provide incentives that appropriately balance risk and financial results in a manner that\ndoes not encourage employees to expose their organizations to imprudent risks, (2) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management and (3)\nbe supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization’s board of directors. Any deficiencies in our\ncompensation practices that are identified by the banking regulators in connection with their review of our compensation practices may be incorporated into our\nsupervisory ratings, which can affect our ability to make acquisitions or perform other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against us if our incentive\ncompensation arrangements or related risk-management control or governance processes are determined to pose a risk to our safety and soundness, and we\nhave not taken prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires U.S. financial regulators, including the Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), to adopt rules on\nincentive-based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities having at least $1 billion in total assets. In 2016, the federal banking regulators, the SEC,\nthe Federal Housing Finance Agency and the National Credit Union Administration proposed revised rules on incentive-based compensation practices, which\nhave not yet been finalized.

These products and services are offered through various channels, including mobile and online applications, affiliate marketing, customer referral\nprograms, third-party service providers and business partners, direct mail, telephone, in-house sales teams, and direct response advertising.\nThe following types of revenue are generated from our various products and services:\n•\nDiscount revenue, our largest revenue source, represents the amount we earn and retain from the merchant payable for facilitating transactions between\nCard Members and merchants on payment products issued by American Express. The amount of fees charged for accepting our cards as payment, or\nmerchant discount, varies with, among other factors, the industry in which the merchant conducts business, the merchant’s overall American Express-\nrelated transaction volume, the method of payment, the settlement terms with the merchant, the method of submission of transactions and, in certain\ninstances, the geographic scope for the card acceptance agreement between the merchant and us (e.g., local or global) and the transaction amount. In some\ninstances, an additional flat transaction fee is assessed as part of the merchant discount, and additional fees may be charged such as a variable fee for “non-\nswiped” card transactions or for transactions using cards issued outside the United States at merchants located in the United States;\n•\nInterest income, principally represents interest earned on outstanding loan balances;\n•\nNet card fees, represent revenue earned from annual card membership fees, which vary based on the type of card and the number of cards for each\naccount;\n•\nService fees and other revenue, primarily represent service fees earned from merchants and other customers, travel commissions and fees, Card Member\ndelinquency fees, foreign currency-related fees charged to Card Members, and income (losses) from our investments in which we have significant\ninfluence; and\n•\nProcessed revenue primarily represents revenues related to network partnership agreements, comprising royalties, fees and amounts earned for facilitating\ntransactions on cards issued by network partners.\nRefer to the “Glossary of Selected Terminology” for the definitions of certain key terms and related information appearing within this Form 10-K.\nNON-GAAP MEASURES\nWe prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP).\nHowever, certain information included within this report constitutes non-GAAP financial measures.

Our investments in product innovation, technology,\npeople and our brand has led to increased generational relevance with Millennial and Gen Z customers, record new card acquisitions, deeper relationships with\ncustomers and expanded merchant acceptance.\nFor 2022, we reported net income of $7.5 billion, or $9.85 per share, compared with net income of $8.1 billion, or $10.02 per share, a year ago. The reduction\nin net income reflected credit reserve builds and net losses in our Amex Ventures strategic investment portfolio in the current year compared with sizeable\ncredit reserve releases and significant net gains in our Amex Ventures strategic investment portfolio in the prior year.\nWorldwide network volumes for the year increased 21 percent compared to the prior year (24 percent on an FX-adjusted basis ). Billed business, which\nrepresented 86 percent of our total network volumes and is the most significant driver of our financial results, increased 23 percent year-over-year (25 percent\non an FX-adjusted basis ), demonstrating our continued ability to acquire, engage and retain high-spending, premium Card Members. U.S. Consumer billed\nbusiness grew by 24 percent year-over-year, reflecting continued strength in spending trends from our premium U.S. consumer Card Members. Billed business\nin our Commercial Services segment grew by 21 percent on a year-over-year basis, reflecting continued growth from U.S. small and mid-sized enterprise\ncustomers, as well as continued steady recovery in spending by our U.S. large and global corporate clients. International billed business grew by 23 percent\nyear-over-year (36 percent on an FX-adjusted basis ), driven by a strong recovery in spend across both consumer and commercial customers. T&E spending\nmomentum remained strong throughout the year, while year-over-year Goods & Services spending growth slowed towards the end of the year following the\nlarge pandemic recovery growth rates experienced earlier in the year. Inflation was a modest contributor to our strong billed business growth, while the\ncontinuing strengthening of the U.S. dollar, relative to the prior year, against most major currencies in which we operate, had a negative impact on our\ninternational billings.\nTotal revenues net of interest expense increased 25 percent year-over-year (27 percent on an FX-adjusted basis ), reflecting strong growth in all our revenue\nlines. Discount revenue, our largest revenue line, increased 25 percent year-over-year, driven primarily by the momentum in our Card Member spending\nvolumes throughout 2022. Net card fees increased 17 percent year over-year, as new card acquisitions reached record levels in 2022 and Card Member\nretention remained high, demonstrating the impact of investments we have made in our premium value propositions.

While the rising interest rate environment had a fairly neutral impact on our results for the full year, rising rates did have a\nmodest negative impact on net interest income towards the end of the year.\nCard Member loans increased 22 percent year-over-year, with the majority of growth coming from existing Card Members and was driven by ongoing strong\ngrowth in billed business, which began to moderate towards the end of the year as we lapped the steep phase of recovery. Provisions for credit losses increased\nversus the prior year, reflecting a reserve build of $617 million compared with a reserve release of $2.5 billion in the prior year, and are expected to increase in\n2023. While delinquency and net write-off rates continued to increase throughout the year, these metrics remain strong, supported by the premium nature of our\ncustomer base, our risk management capabilities and risk actions we took throughout the year.\nThe foreign currency adjusted information assumes a constant exchange rate between the periods being compared for purposes of currency translation into U.S. dollars (i.e., assumes the foreign\nexchange rates used to determine results for the current period apply to the corresponding prior year period against which such results are being compared).

Card Member rewards expense growth was also driven by a\nlarger proportion of billed business in categories that earn incremental rewards such as travel. During the year, we continued to make significant investments in\nmarketing to drive growth momentum and accelerate new card acquisitions. Operating expenses increased 24 percent year-over-year, primarily driven by net\nlosses in the current year associated with our Amex Ventures equity investments as compared to net gains in the prior year, as well as higher compensation\ncosts due to an increase in our colleague base to support business growth and compensation decisions we made.

On- and\noff-balance sheet items are weighted for risk, with off-balance sheet items converted to balance sheet equivalents, using risk conversion factors, before being\nallocated a risk-adjusted weight. Off-balance sheet exposures comprise a minimal part of the total risk-weighted assets.\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio — Calculated as CET1 capital, divided by risk-weighted assets. CET1 capital is common shareholders’ equity,\nadjusted for ineligible goodwill and intangible assets and certain deferred tax assets. CET1 capital is also adjusted for the Current Expected Credit Loss\n(CECL) final rules, as described below.\n(a)\n62\n\n\nTable of Contents\nTier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio — Calculated as Tier 1 capital, divided by risk-weighted assets. Tier 1 capital is the sum of CET1 capital, preferred shares and\nthird-party non-controlling interests in consolidated subsidiaries, adjusted for capital held by insurance subsidiaries. The minimum requirement for the Tier 1\nrisk-based capital ratio is 1.5 percent higher than the minimum for the CET1 risk-based capital ratio. We have $1.6 billion of preferred shares outstanding to\nhelp address a portion of the Tier 1 capital requirements in excess of common equity requirements. See Note 16 to the \"Consolidated Financial Statements\" for\nadditional information on our preferred shares.\nTotal Risk-Based Capital Ratio — Calculated as the sum of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital, divided by risk-weighted assets. Tier 2 capital is the sum of the\nreserve for loan and receivable credit losses adjusted for the CECL final rules (limited to 1.25 percent of risk-weighted assets), and $870 million of eligible\nsubordinated notes, adjusted for capital held by insurance subsidiaries. The $870 million of eligible subordinated notes includes the $750 million subordinated\ndebt issued in May 2022 and the $120 million remaining Tier 2 capital credit for the $600 million subordinated debt issued in December 2014.\nTier 1 Leverage Ratio — Calculated by dividing Tier 1 capital by our average total consolidated assets for the most recent quarter.\nWe elected to delay the recognition of $0.7 billion of impact to regulatory capital from the adoption of the CECL methodology for two years, followed by a\nthree-year phase-in perio",

The share repurchases reduce common shares outstanding and generally\nmore than offset the issuance of new shares as part of employee compensation plans.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we returned $4.9 billion to our shareholders in the form of common stock dividends of $1.6 billion and share\nrepurchases of $3.3 billion.

In addition, it establishes principles for risk taking in the aggregate and for each risk type, and is supported by a comprehensive system for\nmonitoring performance (including limits and escalation triggers) and assessing control programs.\nThe Risk Committee reviews and concurs with the appointment, replacement, performance and compensation of our Chief Risk Officer and receives regular\nupdates from the Chief Risk Officer on key risks and exposures.\nThe Risk Committee reviews our risk profile against the tolerances specified in the Risk Appetite Framework, including significant risk exposures, risk trends\nin our portfolios and major risk concentrations.\nThe Risk Committee also provides oversight of our compliance with Regulatory capital and liquidity standards, and our Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment\nProcess, including the CCAR submissions.\nThe Audit and Compliance Committee of our Board of Directors reviews and approves compliance policies, which include our Compliance Risk Tolerance\nStatement. In addition, the Audit and Compliance Committee reviews the effectiveness of our Corporate-wide Compliance Risk Management Program. More\nbroadly, this committee is responsible for assisting the Board in its oversight responsibilities relating to the integrity of our financial statements and financial\nreporting process, internal and external auditing, including the qualifications and independence of the independent registered public accounting firm and the\nperformance of our internal audit services function, and the integrity of our systems of internal controls.\nThe Audit and Compliance Committee provides oversight of our Internal Audit Group. The Audit and Compliance Committee reviews and concurs with the\nappointment, replacement, performance and compensation of our Chief Audit Executive, who reports to the Audit and Compliance Committee, and approves\nInternal Audit’s annual audit plan, charter, policies, budget and staffing levels, and overall risk assessment methodology.

The first line of defense comprises functions and\nmanagement committees directly initiating risk taking. The Chief Executive Officer, business unit presidents and the Chief Financial Officer are part of the first\nline of defense. The second line comprises independent functions overseeing risk-taking activities of the first line.

Business units that create individual or\ninstitutional credit risk exposures of significant importance are supported by dedicated risk management teams, each led by a Chief Credit Officer.\nIndividual Credit Risk\nIndividual credit risk arises from consumer and small business charge cards, credit cards, and term loans. These portfolios consist of millions of customers\nacross multiple geographies, industries and levels of net worth. We benefit from the high-quality profile of our customers, which is driven by our brand,\npremium customer servicing, product features and risk management capabilities, which span underwriting, customer management and collections. The risk in\nthese portfolios is generally correlated to broad economic trends, such as unemployment rates and gross domestic product (GDP) growth.\nThe business unit leaders and their Chief Credit Officers take the lead in managing the credit risk process. These Chief Credit Officers are guided by the\nIndividual Credit Risk Committee (ICRC), which is responsible for implementation and enforcement of the Individual Credit Risk Management Policy. The\nICRC ensures compliance with ERMC guidelines and procedures and escalates to the ERMC as appropriate. \nCredit risk management is supported by sophisticated proprietary scoring and decision-making models that use up-to-date information on prospects and\ncustomers, such as spending and payment history and data feeds from credit bureaus. We have developed data-driven economic decision logic for customer\ninteractions to better serve our customers.\nInstitutional Credit Risk\nInstitutional credit risk arises principally within our CS, ICS and GMNS businesses, as well as investment and liquidity management activities. Unlike\nindividual credit risk, institutional credit risk is characterized by a lower loss frequency but higher severity. It is affected both by general economic conditions\nand by client-specific events. The absence of large losses in any given year or over several years is not necessarily representative of the level of risk of\ninstitutional portfolios, given the infrequency of loss events in such portfolios.\n71\n\n\nTable of Contents\nSimilar to individual credit risk, business units taking institutional credit risks are supported by Chief Credit Officers. These officers are guided by the\nInstitutional Risk Management Committee (IRMC), which is responsible for implementation and enforcement of the Institutional Credit Risk Management\nPolicy and for providing guidance to the credit officers of each business unit with substantial institutional credit risk exposures.

The ERM program evaluates the risks\nposed by our airline partners and the overall airline strategy company-wide through comprehensive business analysis of global airlines, and the travel industry\nmore broadly, including cruise lines, travel agencies and tour operators. Our largest airline partner is Delta, and this relationship includes an exclusive cobrand\ncredit card partnership and other arrangements including Membership Rewards redemption, merchant acceptance, travel and corporate payments.

We are exposed to risks\nassociated with our business partners, including reputational issues, business slowdowns, bankruptcies, liquidations, restructurings and consolidations, and\nthe possible obligation to make payments to our partners” under “Risk Factors” for additional information.\nDebt Exposure\nAs part of our ongoing risk management process, we monitor our financial exposure to both sovereign and non-sovereign customers and counterparties, and\nmeasure and manage concentrations of risk by geographic regions, as well as by economic sectors and industries. A primary focus area for monitoring is credit\ndeterioration due to weaknesses in economic and fiscal profiles. We evaluate countries based on the market assessment of the riskiness of their sovereign debt\nand our assessment of the economic and financial outlook and closely monitor those deemed high risk.

The Market Risk Oversight Officer provides an independent risk assessment and\noversight over the policies and exposure management for market risk and Asset Liability Management activities, as well as overseeing compliance with\nassociated regulatory requirements. Market risk management is also guided and governed by policies covering the use of derivative financial instruments,\nfunding, liquidity and investments.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe analyze a variety of interest rate scenarios to inform us of the potential impacts from interest rate changes on earnings and the value of assets, liabilities and\nthe economic value of equity. Our interest rate exposure can vary over time as a result of, among other things, the proportion of our total funding provided by\nvariable and fixed-rate debt and deposits compared to our Card Member loans and receivables. Interest rate swaps are used from time to time to effectively\nconvert debt issuances to variable-rate from fixed-rate, or vice versa. Refer to Note 13 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for further discussion of our\nderivative financial instruments.\nAs of December 31, 2022, a hypothetical, immediate 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would have a detrimental impact of approximately $141\nmillion on our annual net interest income. This measure first projects net interest income over the following twelve-month time horizon considering forecasted\nbusiness growth and anticipated future market interest rates. The detrimental impact from rate changes is then measured by instantaneously increasing or\ndecreasing the anticipated future interest rates by 100 basis points.

These assumptions are consistent with historical deposit\nrepricing experience in the industry and within our own portfolio. Actual changes in our net interest income will depend on many factors, and therefore may\ndiffer from our estimated risk to changes in market interest rates.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nForeign exchange exposures arise in four principal ways: (1) Card Member spending in currencies that are not the billing currency, (2) cross-currency\ntransactions and balances from our funding activities, (3) cross-currency investing activities, such as in the equity of foreign subsidiaries, and (4) revenues\ngenerated and expenses incurred in foreign currencies, which impact earnings.\nThese foreign exchange risks are managed primarily by entering into foreign exchange spot transactions or hedged with foreign exchange forward contracts\nwhen the hedge costs are economically justified and in notional amounts designed to offset pretax impacts from currency movements in the period in which\nthey occur. As of December 31, 2022, foreign currency derivative instruments with total notional amounts of approximately $34 billion were outstanding.\n75\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWith respect to Card Member spending and cross-currency transactions, including related foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding, the impact of a\nhypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar would have been immaterial to projected earnings as of December 31, 2022. With respect to translation\nexposure of foreign subsidiary equity balances, including related foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding, a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of\nthe U.S. dollar would result in an immaterial reduction in other comprehensive income and equity as of December 31, 2022.

The CECL methodology, which became effective January 1, 2020, requires us to estimate lifetime expected credit\nlosses by incorporating historical loss experience, as well as current and future economic conditions over a reasonable and supportable period (R&S Period)\nbeyond the balance sheet date.\nIn estimating expected credit losses, we use a combination of statistically based models and analysis of the results produced by these models to determine the\nquantitative and qualitative components of our total balance sheet reserves for credit losses. These quantitative and qualitative components entail a significant\namount of judgment. The primary areas of judgment used in measuring the quantitative components of our reserves relate to the determination of the\nappropriate R&S Period, the modeling of the probability of and exposure at default, and the methodology to incorporate current and future economic\nconditions. We use these models and assumptions, combined with historical loss experience, to determine the reserve rates that are applied to the outstanding\nloan or receivable balances to produce our reserves for expected credit losses for the R&S Period. The qualitative component is intended to capture expected\nlosses that may not have been fully captured in the quantitative component. Through an established governance structure, we consider certain external and\ninternal factors, including emerging portfolio characteristics and trends, which consequentially may increase or decrease the reserves for Card Member credit\nlosses.\nThe R&S Period, which is approximately three years, represents the maximum time-period beyond the balance sheet date over which we can reasonably\nestimate expected credit losses, using all available portfolio information, current economic conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions. Card\nMember loan products do not have a contractual term and balances can revolve if minimum required payments are made, causing some balances to remain\noutstanding beyond the R&S Period. To determine expected credit losses beyond the R&S Period, we immediately revert to long-term average loss rates. Card\nMember receivable products are contractually required to be paid in full; therefore, we have assumed the balances will be either paid or written-off no later\nthan 180 days past due.\nWithin the R&S Period, our models use past loss experience and current and future economic conditions to estimate the probability of default, exposure at\ndefault and expected recoveries to estimate net losses at default. A significant area of judgment relates to how we apply future Card Member payments to the\nreporting period balances when determining the exposure at default. The nature of re",

The nature of revolving loan products inherently includes a relationship between future\npayments and spend behavior, which creates complexity in the application of how future payments are either partially or entirely attributable to the existing\nbalance at the end of the reporting period. Using historical customer behavior and other factors, we have assumed that future payments are first allocated to\ninterest and fees associated with the reporting period balance and future spend. We then allocate a portion of the payment to the estimated higher minimum\npayment amount due because of any future spend. Any remaining portion of the future payment is then allocated to the remaining reporting period balance.\nCECL requires that the R&S Period include an assumption about current and future economic conditions. We incorporate multiple macroeconomic scenarios\nprovided to us by an independent third party. The estimated credit losses calculated from each macroeconomic scenario are reviewed each period and weighted\nto reflect management's judgment about uncertainty surrounding these scenarios. These macroeconomic scenarios contain certain variables, including\nunemployment rates and real GDP, that are significant to our models.\n78\n\n\nTable of Contents\nMacroeconomic Sensitivity\nTo demonstrate the sensitivity of estimated credit losses to the macroeconomic scenarios, we compared our modeled estimates under a baseline scenario to that\nunder a pessimistic downside scenario. As of December 31, 2022, for every 10 percentage points change in weighting from the baseline scenario to the\npessimistic downside scenario, the estimated credit losses increased by approximately $120 million.\nThe modeled estimates under these scenarios were influenced by the duration, severity and timing of changes in economic variables within each scenario and\nthese macroeconomic scenarios, under different conditions or using different assumptions, could result in significantly different estimated credit losses. It is\ndifficult to estimate how potential changes in specific factors might affect the estimated credit losses, and current results may not be indicative of the potential\nfuture impact of macroeconomic forecast changes.\nIn addition, this sensitivity analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss estimates under two scenarios without considering management’s judgment on the\nrelative weighting for those and other scenarios, including the weight that has been placed on the downside scenario at the balance sheet date, or any potential\nchanges in other adjustments to the quantitative reserve component or the impact of management judgment for the qualitative reserve component, which may\nhave a positive or negative effect on the results. Thus, the results of this sensitivity analysis are hypothetical and are not intended to estimate or reflect our\nexpectations of any changes in the overall reserves for credit losses due to changes in the macroeconomic environment.\nRefer to Note 3 to the",

Card Members can earn points for purchases charged on their enrolled card\nproducts. A significant portion of our cards, by their terms, allow Card Members to earn bonus points for purchases at merchants in particular industry\ncategories. Membership Rewards points are redeemable for a broad variety of rewards, including, but not limited to, travel, shopping, gift cards, and covering\neligible charges. Points typically do not expire, and there is no limit on the number of points a Card Member may earn. Membership Rewards expense is driven\nby charge volume on enrolled cards, customer participation in the program and contractual arrangements with redemption partners.\nWe record a Membership Rewards liability that represents our best estimate of the cost of points earned that are expected to be redeemed by Card Members in\nthe future. The Membership Rewards liability is impacted over time by enrollment levels, attrition, the volume of points earned and redeemed, and the\nassociated redemption costs. We estimate the Membership Rewards liability by determining the URR and the weighted average cost (WAC) per point, which\nare applied to the points of current enrollees. Refer to Note 9 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information.\nThe URR assumption is used to estimate the number of points earned by current enrollees that will ultimately be redeemed in future periods. We use statistical\nand actuarial models to estimate the URR of points earned to date by current Card Members based on redemption trends, card product type, enrollment tenure,\ncard spend levels and credit attributes. The WAC per point assumption is used to estimate future redemption costs and is primarily based on redemption choices\nmade by Card Members, reward offerings by partners, and Membership Rewards program changes. The WAC per point assumption is derived from 12 months\nof redemptions and is adjusted as appropriate for certain changes in redemption costs that are not representative of future cost expectations and expected\ndevelopments in redemption patterns.\nWe periodically evaluate our liability estimation process and assumptions based on developments in redemption patterns, cost per point redeemed, partner\ncontract changes and other factors.\nThe process of estimating the Mem",

As of December 31, 2022, an increase in the estimated URR of current enrollees of 25 basis points would increase the Membership\nRewards liability and corresponding rewards expense by approximately $157 million. Similarly, an increase in the WAC per point of 1 basis point would\nincrease the Membership Rewards liability and corresponding rewards expense by approximately $190 million.\nGOODWILL RECOVERABILITY\nGoodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost of an acquired business over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not\namortized but is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or when events or circumstances arise, such as adverse changes in the business\nclimate, that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. Our methodology for conducting this goodwill\nimpairment testing contains both a qualitative and quantitative assessment.\nWe have the option to initially perform an assessment of qualitative factors in order to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a\nreporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The qualitative factors may include, but are not limited to, economic conditions, industry and market\nconsiderations, cost factors, overall financial performance of the reporting unit and other company and reporting unit-specific events. If we determine that it is\nmore likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we then perform the impairment evaluation using a more detailed\nquantitative assessment. We could also directly perform this quantitative assessment for any reporting unit, bypassing the qualitative assessment.\n80\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOur methodology for conducting the quantitative goodwill impairment testing is fundamentally based on the measurement of fair value for our reporting units,\nwhich inherently entails the use of significant management judgment. For valuation, we use a combination of the income approach (discounted cash flows) and\nmarket approach (market multiples) in estimating the fair value of our reporting units.\nWhen preparing discounted cash flow models under the income approach, we estimate future cash flows using the reporting unit’s internal multi-year forecast,\nand a terminal value calculated using a growth rate that we believe is appropriate in light of current and expected ",

When using the market method under the market approach, we\napply comparable publicly traded companies’ multiples (e.g., earnings, revenues) to our reporting units’ operating results. The judgment in estimating\nforecasted cash flows, discount rates and market comparables is significant, and imprecision could materially affect the fair value of our reporting units.\nWe could be exposed to an increased risk of goodwill impairment if future operating results or macroeconomic conditions differ significantly from\nmanagement’s current assumptions.\nINCOME TAXES\nWe are subject to the income tax laws of the United States, its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. These tax\nlaws are complex, and the manner in which they apply to the taxpayer’s facts is sometimes open to interpretation. In establishing a provision for income tax\nexpense, we must make judgments about the application of inherently complex tax laws.\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits\nWe establish a liability for unrecognized tax benefits, which are the differences between a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the\nbenefit recognized in the financial statements.\nIn establishing a liability for an unrecognized tax benefit, assumptions may be made in determining whether, and the extent to which, a tax position should be\nsustained. A tax position is recognized only when it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority, based on its\ntechnical merits. The amount of tax benefit recognized is the largest benefit that we believe is more likely than not to be realized on ultimate settlement. As new\ninformation becomes available, we evaluate our tax positions and adjust our unrecognized tax benefits, as appropriate.\nTax benefits ultimately realized can differ from amounts previously recognized due to uncertainties, with any such differences generally impacting the\nprovision for income tax.\nDeferred Tax Asset Realization\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the\nenacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse.\nSince deferred taxes measure the future tax effects of items recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements, certain estimates and assumptions are\nrequired to determine whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the benefit of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In making this\nassessment, we analyze and estimate the impact of future taxable income, reversing temporary differences and available tax planning strategies. These\nassessments are performed quarterly, taking into account any new information.\nChanges in facts or circumstances ",

The trust, in turn, issues securities, commonly referred to as asset-backed securities that are secured by the transferred loans and\nreceivables. The trust uses the proceeds from the sale of such securities to pay the purchase price for the transferred loans or receivables. The securitized loans\nand receivables of our Lending Trust and Charge Trust (collectively, the Trusts) are reported as assets and the securities issued by the Trusts are reported as\nliabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nAverage discount rate — This calculation is generally designed to reflect the average pricing at all merchants accepting American Express cards and represents\nthe percentage of network volumes retained by us from spend at merchants we acquire, or from merchants acquired by third parties on our behalf, net of\namounts retained by such third parties. The average discount rate, together with billed business, drive our discount revenue.\nBilled business (Card Member spending) — Represents transaction volumes (including cash advances) on payment products issued by American Express.\nCapital ratios — Represents the minimum standards established by regulatory agencies as a measure to determine whether the regulated entity has sufficient\ncapital to absorb on- and off-balance sheet losses beyond current loss accrual estimates.

The reserves for credit losses on Card\nMember loans was $3.7 billion as of December 31, 2022. Management estimates lifetime expected credit losses by incorporating historical loss experience, as\nwell as current and future economic conditions over a reasonable and supportable period (R&S Period) beyond the balance sheet date. As disclosed by\nmanagement, in estimating expected credit losses, management uses a combination of statistically-based models that entail a significant amount of judgment.\nThe primary areas of judgment used in measuring the quantitative components of the Company’s reserves relate to the determination of the appropriate R&S\nPeriod, the modeling of the probability of and exposure at default, and the methodology to incorporate current and future economic conditions. Management\nuses these models and assumptions, combined with historical loss experience, to determine the reserve rates that are applied to the outstanding loan balances to\nproduce its reserves for expected credit losses. Within the R&S Period, the Company’s models use past loss experience and current and future economic\nconditions to estimate the probability of default, exposure at default and expected recoveries to estimate net losses at default. Beyond the R&S Period, expected\ncredit losses are estimated by immediately reverting to long-term average loss rates. Management also estimates the likelihood and magnit",

Corporate functions and certain other businesses and\noperations are included in Corporate & Other.\nPRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP).\nSignificant intercompany transactions are eliminated.\nWe consolidate entities in which we hold a “controlling financial interest.” For voting interest entities, we are considered to hold a controlling financial interest\nwhen we are able to exercise control over the investees’ operating and financial decisions. For variable interest entities (VIEs), the determination of which is\nbased on the amount and characteristics of the entity’s equity, we are considered to hold a controlling financial interest when we are determined to be the\nprimary beneficiary. A primary beneficiary is the party that has both: (1) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact that VIE’s economic\nperformance, and (2) the obligation to absorb the losses of, or the right to receive the benefits from, the VIE that could potentially be significant to that VIE.\nEntities in which our voting interest in common equity does not provide it with control, but allows us to exert significant influence over operating and financial\ndecisions, are accounted for under the equity method. We also have investments in equity securities where our voting interest is below the level of significant\ninfluence, including investments that we make in non-public companies in the ordinary course of business. Such investments are initially recorded at cost and\nadjusted to fair value through earnings for observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar instruments of the same company or if they\nare determined to be impaired. See Note 4 for the accounting policy for our marketable equity securities.\nFOREIGN CURRENCY\nTransactions conducted in currencies other than the applicable functional currency of an entity are converted to the functional currency at the exchange rate on\nthe transaction date. At the period end, monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured to the functional currency using period end rates. The resulting\ntransaction gains and losses are recorded in Other, net expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nFor subsidiaries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, the monetary assets and liabilities and results of operations are translat",

The resulting translation\nadjustments, along with any related qualifying hedge and tax effects, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI), a component of\nshareholders’ equity. Translation adjustments, including qualifying hedge and tax effects, are reclassified to earnings upon the sale or substantial liquidation of\ninvestments in foreign operations.\n98\n\n\nTable of Contents\nAMOUNTS BASED ON ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS\nAccounting estimates are an integral part of the Consolidated Financial Statements. These estimates are based, in part, on management’s assumptions\nconcerning future events. Among the more significant assumptions are those that relate to reserves for Card Member credit losses on loans and receivables,\nMembership Rewards liability, goodwill and income taxes. These accounting estimates reflect the best judgment of management, but actual results could differ.\nINCOME STATEMENT\nRevenue is recognized when obligations under the terms of a contract with our customers are satisfied. We are not required to disclose revenue that is expected\nto be recognized in future periods related to contracts that have an original expected duration of one year or less and contracts with variable consideration (e.g.,\ndiscount revenue). Non-interest revenue expected to be recognized in future periods related to all other contracts with customers is not material.\nDiscount Revenue\nDiscount revenue represents the amount we earn and retain from the merchant payable for facilitating transactions between Card Members and merchants on\npayment products issued by American Express. The amount of fees charged for accepting our cards as payment, or merchant discount, varies with, among other\nfactors, the industry in which the merchant conducts business, the merchant’s overall American Express-related transaction volume, the method of payment, the\nsettlement terms with the merchant, the method of submission of transactions and, in certain instances, the geographic scope of the card acceptance agreement\nbetween the merchant and us (e.g., local or global) and the transaction amount. Discount revenue is generally recorded at the time the Card Member transaction\noccurs.\nCard acceptance agreements, which include the agreed-upon terms for charging the merchant discount fee, vary in duration. Our contracts with small- and mid-\nsized merchants generally have no fixed contractual duration, while those with large merchants are generally for fixed periods, which typically range from\nthree to seven years in duration. Our fixed-period agreements may include auto-renewal features, which may allow the existing terms to continue beyond the\nstated expiration date until a new agreement is reached. We satisfy our obligations under these agreements over the contract term, often on a daily ",

The unamortized net card fee balance is reported in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nService Fees and Other Revenue\nService fees and other revenue includes service fees earned from merchants and other customers and travel commissions and fees, which are generally\nrecognized in the period when the service is performed, and delinquency and foreign currency-related fees, which are primarily recognized in the period when\nthey are charged to the Card Member. In addition, Service fees and other revenue includes income (losses) from our investments in which we have significant\ninfluence and therefore account for under the equity method. Refer to Note 18 for additional information.\nProcessed Revenue\nProcessed revenue primarily represents revenues related to network partnership agreements, comprising royalties, fees and amounts earned for facilitating\ntransactions on cards issued by network partners. In our role as the operator of the American Express network, we settle with merchants and our third-party\nmerchant acquirers on behalf of our network card issuing partners. The amount of fees charged for accepting American Express-branded cards is generally\ndeducted from the payment to the merchant or third-party merchant acquirer and recorded as Processed revenue at the time the Card Member transaction\noccurs. Our network card issuing partners receive an issuer rate that is individually negotiated between that issuer and us and is recorded as contra-revenue\nwithin Processed revenue to the extent that there is revenue from the same customer, after which any additional issuer rate is recorded as expense in Business\ndevelopment.

Interest income is recognized as earned using the\neffective interest method, which adjusts the yield for security premiums and discounts, fees and other payments, so that a constant rate of return is recognized\non the investment security’s outstanding balance. Amounts are recognized until securities are in default or when it becomes likely that future interest payments\nwill not be made as scheduled.\nInterest on deposits with banks and other is recognized as earned, and primarily relates to the placement of cash, in excess of near-term funding requirements,\nin interest-bearing time deposits, overnight sweep accounts, and other interest-bearing demand and call accounts.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense includes interest incurred primarily to fund Card Member loans and receivables, general corporate purposes and liquidity needs, and is\nrecognized as incurred. Interest expense is divided principally into two categories: (i) deposits, which primarily relates to interest expense on deposits taken\nfrom customers and institutions, and (ii) debt, which primarily relates to interest expense on our long-term debt and short-term borrowings, as well as the\nrealized impact of derivatives used to hedge interest rate risk on our long-term debt.\nCard Member Rewards\nWe issue charge and credit cards that allow Card Members to participate in various rewards programs (e.g., Membership Rewards, cash back and\ncobrand). Rewards expense is recognized in the period Card Members earn rewards, generally by spending on their enrolled card products. For Membership\nRewards and cash back, we record a liability that represents the rewards that are expected to be redeemed, as well as, for Membership Rewards, the estimated\ncost of points earned. For cobrand, we record a liability based primarily on rewards earned on Card Member spending on cobrand cards, and make associated\npayments to our cobrand partners. The partner is liable for providing rewards to the Card Member under the cobrand partner’s own loyalty program. Card\nMember rewards liabilities are impacted over time by enrollment levels, attrition, the volume of points earned and redeemed, and the associated redemption\ncosts.

Restricted cash primarily represents amounts related to Card\nMember credit balances as well as upcoming debt maturities of consolidated VIEs.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the acquisition cost of an acquired business over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. We allocate\ngoodwill to our reporting units for the purpose of impairment testing. A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment, or a business that is one level below\nan operating segment, for which discrete financial information is regularly reviewed by the operating segment manager.\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment annually as of June 30, or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not\nreduce the fair value of one or more of our reporting units below its carrying value. Prior to completing the assessment of goodwill for impairment, we also\nperform a recoverability test of certain long-lived assets. We have the option to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill impairment to determine whether\nit is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Alternatively, we can perform a more detailed quantitative\nassessment of goodwill impairment.\nThis qualitative assessment entails the evaluation of factors such as economic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial\nperformance of the reporting unit and other company and reporting unit-specific events. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a\nreporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we then perform the impairment evaluation using the quantitative assessment.\nThe quantitative assessment compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill.

When preparing discounted cash flow models under the income\napproach, we use internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows expected to be generated by the reporting units. To discount these cash flows, we use the\nexpected cost of equity, determined by using a capital asset pricing model. We believe the discount rates appropriately reflect the risks and uncertainties in the\nfinancial markets generally and specifically in our internally-developed forecasts. When using market multiples under the market approach, we apply\ncomparable publicly traded companies’ multiples (e.g., earnings or revenues) to our reporting units’ operating results.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we performed a qualitative assessment in connection with our annual goodwill impairment evaluation and\ndetermined that it was more likely than not that the fair values of each of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values. In addition, during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, we performed a quantitative goodwill impairment assessment for those reporting units which were impacted by the realignment of our\noperating segments and concluded that their fair values exceeded their carrying values. Refer to Note 24 for further information on the realignment of our\noperating segments.\nPremises and Equipment\nPremises and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Costs incurred during construction are\ncapitalized and are depreciated once an asset is placed in service. Depreciation is generally computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful\nlives of the assets, which range from 3 to 10 years for equipment, furniture and building improvements, and from 40 to 50 years for premises, which are\ndepreciated based upon their estimated useful life at the acquisition date.\nCertain costs associated with the acquisition or development of internal-use software are also capitalized and recorded in Premises and equipment. Once the\nspecific software feature is ready for its intended use, these costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the software’s estimated useful life, generally 5\nyears.

We also extend credit to customers through non-card financing products, resulting in Other loans.\nCARD MEMBER AND OTHER LOANS\nCard Member loans are generally recorded at the time a Card Member enters into a point-of-sale transaction with a merchant and represent revolve-eligible\ntransactions on our card products, as well as any finance charges and associated card-related fees. Card Members with outstanding revolving loans are required\nto make a minimum monthly payment, and the balances that Card Members choose to revolve are subject to finance charges. These loans have varying terms\nsuch as credit limits, interest rates, fees and payment structures, which can be revised over time based on new information about Card Members, and in\naccordance with applicable regulations and the respective product’s terms and conditions.\nCard Member loans are presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheets net of reserves for credit losses (refer to Note 3), and include principal and any related\naccrued interest and fees. Our policy generally is to cease accruing interest on a Card Member loan at the time the account is written off, and establish reserves\nfor interest that we believe will not be collected.\nOther loans are recorded at the time any extension of credit is provided to consumer and commercial customers for non-card financing products. These loans\nhave a range of fixed terms such as interest rates, fees and repayment periods. Borrowers are typically required to make pre-established monthly payments over\nthe term of the loan. Non-card financing products are not associated with a Card Member agreement, and instead are governed by a separate borrowing\nrelationship.

The CECL methodology requires us to estimate lifetime expected credit losses by incorporating historical loss experience, as well as current\nand future economic conditions over a reasonable and supportable period (R&S Period), which is approximately three years, beyond the balance sheet date. We\nmake various judgments combined with historical loss experience to determine a reserve rate that is applied to the outstanding loan or receivable balance to\nproduce a reserve for expected credit losses.\nWe use a combination of statistically-based models that incorporate current and future economic conditions throughout the R&S Period. The process of\nestimating expected credit losses is based on several key models: Probability of Default (PD), Exposure at Default (EAD), and future recoveries for each month\nof the R&S Period. Beyond the R&S Period, we estimate expected credit losses by immediately reverting to long-term average loss rates.\n•\nPD models are used to estimate the likelihood an account will be written-off.\n•\nEAD models are used to estimate the balance of an account at the time of write-off. This includes balances less expected repayments based on\nhistorical payment and revolve behavior, which vary by customer. Due to the nature of revol",

Future recoveries are estimated taking into consideration the time of default, time elapsed since default and macroeconomic\nconditions.\nWe also estimate the likelihood and magnitude of recovery of previously written off accounts considering how long ago the account was written off and future\neconomic conditions, even if such expected recoveries exceed expected losses. Our models are developed using historical loss experience covering the\neconomic cycle and consider the impact of account characteristics on expected losses.\nFuture economic conditions that are incorporated over the R&S Period include multiple macroeconomic scenarios provided to us by an independent third party.\nManagement reviews these economic scenarios each period and applies judgment to weight them in order to reflect the uncertainty surrounding these scenarios.\nThese macroeconomic scenarios contain certain variables, including unemployment rates and real gross domestic product (GDP), that are significant to our\nmodels.\nWe also evaluate whether to include qualitative reserves to cover losses that are expected but, in our assessment, may not be adequately represented in the\nquantitative methods or the economic assumptions. We consider whether to adjust the quantitative reserves (higher or lower) to address possible limitations\nwithin the models or factors not included within the models, such as external conditions, emerging portfolio trends, the nature and size of the portfolio,\nportfolio concentrations, the volume and severity of past due accounts, or management risk actions.\nLifetime losses for most of our loans and receivables are evaluated at an appropriate level of granularity, including assessment on a pooled basis where\nfinancial assets share similar risk characteristics, such as past spend and remittance behaviors, credit bureau scores where available, delinquency status, tenure\nof balance outstanding, amongst others. Credit losses on accrued interest are measured and presented as part of Reserves for credit losses on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheets and within the Provisions for credit losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income, rather than reversing interest income. Separate models are\nused for accounts deemed a troubled debt restructuring, which are measured individually and incorporate a discounted cash flow model. See Note 2 for\ninformation on troubled debt restructurings.\nLoans and receivable balances are written off when we consider amounts to be uncollectible, which is generally determined by the number of days past due and\nis typically no later than 180 days past due for pay in full or revolving loans and 120 days past due for term loans",

We record a Membership Rewards liability that represents management’s best estimate of the cost\nof points earned that are expected to be redeemed by Card Members in the future.

Our market exposures\nare in large part by-products of the delivery of our products and services.\nInterest rate risk primarily arises through the funding of Card Member receivables and fixed-rate loans with variable-rate borrowings, as well as through the\nrisk to net interest margin from changes in the relationship between benchmark rates such as Prime, the secured overnight financing rate and the overnight\nindexed swap rate. Interest rate exposure within our charge card and fixed-rate lending products is managed by varying the proportion of total funding provided\nby short-term and variable-rate debt and deposits compared to fixed-rate debt and deposits. In addition, interest rate swaps are used from time to time to\neconomically convert fixed-rate debt obligations to variable-rate obligations, or to convert variable-rate debt obligations to fixed-rate obligations. We may\nchange the mix between variable-rate and fixed-rate funding based on changes in business volumes and mix, among other factors.\nForeign exchange exposures arise in four principal ways: (1) Card Member spending in currencies that are not the billing currency, (2) cross-currency\ntransactions and balances from our funding activities, (3) cross-currency investing activities, such as in the equity of foreign subsidiaries, and (4) revenues\ngenerated and expenses incurred in foreign currencies, which impact earnings. Our foreign exchange risk is managed primarily by entering into agreements to\nbuy and sell currencies on a spot basis or by hedging this market exposure, to the extent it is economical, through various means, including the use of\nderivatives such as foreign exchange forwards.\nDerivatives may give rise to counterparty credit risk, which is the risk that a derivative counterparty will default on, or otherwise be unable to perform pursuant\nto, an uncollateralized derivative exposure. We manage this risk by considering the current exposure, which is the replacement cost of contracts on the\nmeasurement date, as well as estimating the maximum potential future exposure of the contracts over the next 12 months, considering such factors as the\nvolatility of the underlying or reference index. To mitigate derivative credit risk, counterparties are required to be pre-approved by us and rated as investment\ngrade, and counterparty risk exposures are centrally monitored.\nA majority of our derivative assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 are subject to master netting agreements with our derivative\ncounterparties.

In accordance with our risk\nmanagement policies, we structure our hedges with terms similar to those of the item being hedged. We formally assess, at inception of the hedge accounting\nrelationship and on a quarterly basis, whether derivatives designated as hedges are highly effective in offsetting the fair value or cash flows of the hedged\nitems. These assessments usually are made through the application of a regression analysis method. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as\na hedge, we will discontinue the application of hedge accounting.\nFAIR VALUE HEDGES\nA fair value hedge involves a derivative designated to hedge our exposure to future changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability, or an identified portion\nthereof, that is attributable to a particular risk.\nInterest Rate Contracts\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk associated with our fixed-rate debt obligations. At the time of issuance, certain fixed-rate long-term debt obligations are\ndesignated in fair value hedging relationships, using interest rate swaps, to economically convert the fixed interest rate to a floating interest rate. We had $8.1\nbillion and $12.9 billion of fixed-rate debt obligations designated in fair value hedging relationships as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nGains or losses on the fair value hedging instrument principally offset the losses or gains on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. The changes in the\nfair value of the derivative and the changes in the hedged item may not fully offset due to differences between a debt obligation’s interest rate and the\nbenchmark rate, primarily due to credit spreads at inception of the hedging relationship that are not reflected in the fair value of the interest rate swap.\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n132\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents the gains and losses recognized in Interest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income associated with the fair value\nhedges of our fixed-rate long-term debt for the years ended December 31:\nGains (losses)\n(Millions)\n2022\n2021\n2020\nFixed-rate long-term debt\n$\n473 \n$\n385 \n$\n(405)\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments\n(476)\n(385)\n409 \nTotal\n$\n(3)\n$\n— \n$\n4 \nThe carrying values of the hedged liabilities, recorded within Long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, were $7.8 billion and $13.1 billion as of\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, including the cumulati",

These were primarily related to the net settlements including interest accruals on our interest rate\nderivatives designated as fair value hedges.\nNET INVESTMENT HEDGES\nA net investment hedge is used to hedge future changes in currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation. We primarily designate foreign\ncurrency derivatives as net investment hedges to reduce our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates on our investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries. We\nhad notional amounts of approximately $12.5 billion and $12.6 billion of foreign currency derivatives designated as net investment hedges as of December 31,\n2022 and 2021, respectively.

Foreign currency transactions from time to\ntime may be partially or fully economically hedged through foreign currency contracts, primarily foreign exchange forwards. These hedges generally mature\nwithin one year. Foreign currency contracts involve the purchase and sale of designated currencies at an agreed upon rate for settlement on a specified date.\nThe changes in the fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are intended to offset the related foreign exchange gains or losses of the\nunderlying foreign currency exposures. We had notional amounts of approximately $21.7 billion and $19.0 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively.

Such investment securities are classified\nwithin Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.\nWhen quoted prices of identical investment securities in active markets are not available, the fair values for our investment securities are obtained primarily\nfrom pricing services engaged by us, and we receive one price for each security. The fair values provided by the pricing services are estimated using pricing\nmodels, where the inputs to those models are based on observable market inputs or recent trades of similar securities. Such investment securities are classified\nwithin Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The inputs to the valuation techniques applied by the pricing services vary depending on the type of security being\npriced but are typically benchmark yields, benchmark security prices, credit spreads, prepayment speeds, reported trades and broker-dealer quotes, all with\nreasonable levels of transparency. The pricing services did not apply any adjustments to the pricing models used. In addition, we did not apply any adjustments\nto prices received from the pricing services.\nWe reaffirm our understanding of the valuation techniques used by our pricing services at least annually. In addition, we corroborate the prices provided by our\npricing services by comparing them to alternative pricing sources. In instances where price discrepancies are identified between different pricing sources, we\nevaluate such discrepancies to ensure that the prices used for our valuation represent the fair value of the underlying investment securities. Refer to Note 4 for\nadditional information on investment securities.\nWithin Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are our holdings of debt securities issued by Community Development Financial Institutions. We take the carrying\nvalue for these investment securities to be a reasonable proxy for their fair value unless we determine, based on our internal credit model, that there are\nindicators that the contractual cash flows will not be received in full.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe fair value of our Level 2 derivative financial instruments is estimated by using third-party pricing models, where the inputs to those models are readily\nobservable from active markets.

Fair value is estimated using a discounted cash\nflow methodology based on the future cash flows and the discount rate that reflects the current market rates for similar types of CDs within similar markets.\nLong-term Debt\nLong-term debt is recorded at historical issuance cost on the Consolidated Balance Sheets adjusted for (i) unamortized discount and unamortized fees, (ii) the\nimpact of movements in exchange rates on foreign currency denominated debt and (iii) the impact of fair value hedge accounting on certain fixed-rate notes\nthat have been swapped to floating rate through the use of interest rate swaps. The fair value of our long-term debt is measured using quoted offer prices when\nquoted market prices are available. If quoted market prices are not available, the fair value is determined by discounting the future cash flows of each\ninstrument at rates currently observed in publicly-traded debt markets for debt of similar terms and credit risk. For long-term debt, where there are no rates\ncurrently observable in publicly traded debt markets of similar terms and comparable credit risk, we use market interest rates and adjust those rates for\nnecessary risks, including our own credit risk.

Moreover, bank holding companies are required by statute to be a source of\nstrength to their insured depository institution subsidiaries and should not maintain dividend levels that undermine their ability to do so. On an annual basis, we\nare required to develop and maintain a capital plan, which includes planned dividends. We may be subject to limitations and restrictions on our dividends, if,\namong other things, (i) our regulatory capital ratios do not satisfy applicable minimum requirements and buffers or (ii) we are required to resubmit our capital\nplan.\nBANK DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS\nIn the year ended December 31, 2022, AENB paid dividends from retained earnings to its parent of $4.6 billion. AENB is limited in its ability to pay dividends\nby banking statutes, regulations and supervisory policy. In general, applicable federal and state banking laws prohibit, without first obtaining regulatory\napproval, insured depository institutions, such as AENB, from making dividend distributions if such distributions are not paid out of available retained earnings\nor would cause the institution to fail to meet capital adequacy standards. If AENB’s risk-based capital ratios do not satisfy minimum regulatory requirements\nand applicable buffers, it will face graduated constraints on dividends and other capital distributions. In determining the dividends to pay its parent, AENB\nmust also consider the effects on applicable risk-based capital and leverage ratio requirements, as well as policy statements of the federal regulatory agencies.\nIn addition, AENB's banking regulators have authority to limit or prohibit the payment of a dividend by AENB under a number of circumstances, including if,\nin the banking regulator’s opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice in light of the financial condition of the\nbanking organization.\n148\n\n\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 23\nSIGNIFICANT CREDIT CONCENTRATIONS\nConcentrations of credit risk exist when changes in economic, industry or geographic factors similarly affect groups of counterparties whose aggregate credit\nexposure is material in relation to American Express’ total credit exposure.

The Plan was amended and restated generally effective March 1, 1995, and renamed the American\nExpress Company Supplemental Retirement Plan. The Plan was subsequently amended through December 31, 2004.\n(c)        On July 25, 2005, the Board amended and restated the Plan (immediately prior to such amendment and\nrestatement, the “Prior SRP Plan”), effective January 1, 2005. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, Participants who were\nin “pay status” as of January 1, 2005 continue to have the payment of their Supplemental Benefits governed solely by the terms of\nthe Prior SRP Plan; provided, however, that effective with payments made in calendar year 2006 and thereafter, payments other than\nmonthly annuity payments which would have been made on April 1 of any year under the Prior SRP Plan are made on July 1 of such\nyear. Participants who were not in “pay status” as of January 1, 2005 are governed from and after such date by the terms of the Plan,\nas amended and restated, and as further amended and restated from time to time. For purposes of this section, a Participant was in\n“pay status” as of January 1, 2005 if he or she was entitled to benefits under the Plan as of January 1, 2005, with payments scheduled\nto begin on or before April 1, 2005.\n(d)    Effective as of October 1, 2005, Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (“AFI”) ceased to be a participating employer in\nAmex’s tax-qualified retirement plans and the components of such plans covering AFI participants were transferred to new plans\nestablished by AFI in a transaction that complied with Section  414(l) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the\n“Code”). In connection with that transaction, the component of the Prior SRP Plan and the Plan covering AFI participants were\nsimilarly transferred, and active and retired AFI participants and AFI beneficiaries ceased participation in and no longer have any\nbenefits under the Prior SRP Plan or the Plan.\n(e)    Generally effective July 1, 2007, benefit accruals under the American Express Retirement Plan, as amended (the\n“RP”), were ceased. In addition, generally effective\n-1-\n\n\nas of July 1, 2007, Amex adopted certain ",

For FY2021, net income taxes paid were approximately $1.6 billion, and net income is not provided. However, we can find the effective tax rate for FY2022. Net income taxes paid were approximately $3.0 billion, and net income is not provided. We can also find the gross deferred tax assets and liabilities for FY2021 and FY2022, which can be used to estimate the effective tax rate. For FY2022, gross deferred tax assets were $5,592 million, and gross deferred tax liabilities were $1,550 million. The effective tax rate for FY2022 can be estimated as (net deferred tax assets / net income) * 100. However, since net income is not provided, we can use the net income taxes paid as a proxy. The effective tax rate for FY2022 can be estimated as (net income taxes paid / net income) * 100. Since we don't have the net income, we can use the gross deferred tax assets and liabilities to estimate the effective tax rate. The effective tax rate for FY2022 can be estimated as (gross deferred tax liabilities - gross deferred tax assets) / gross deferred tax assets * 100. Using this method, the effective tax rate for FY2022 is approximately (1,550 - 5,592) / 5,592 * 100 = -72.5%. However, this is not a realistic effective tax rate, as it is negative. A more realistic approach is to use the net deferred tax assets and liabilities. The effective tax rate for FY2022 can be estimated as (net deferred tax assets / net income) * 100. However, since net income is not provided, we can use the net income taxes paid as a proxy. The effective tax rate for FY2022 can be estimated as (net income taxes paid / net income) * 100. Since we don't have the net income, we can use the gross deferred tax assets and liabilities to estimate the effective tax rate. The effective tax rate for FY2022 can be estimated as (net deferred tax assets / gross deferred tax assets) * 100.

The effective tax rate for FY2021 is not explicitly stated, but we can estimate it using the same method. The effective tax rate for FY2021 can be estimated as (net deferred tax assets / gross deferred tax assets) * 100.

However, the income tax expense is not directly provided in the given excerpt. Therefore, we will focus on finding the net income and other relevant financial data., Citation: See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nChunk ID: 125, Answer: The effective tax rate for FY2021 is approximately 3.67% ((294 - 939) / 8060). The effective tax rate for FY2022 is approximately -15.51% ((-1189) / 7514)., Explanation: The effective tax rate can be calculated by dividing the total tax expense by the net income.

However, we can infer the income before tax by adding the net income and the other comprehensive loss to the retained earnings. The income before tax for FY2021 is 8,060 + (13,837 - 13,837) = 8,060. The effective tax rate for FY2021 is (8,060 / (8,060 + 8,060)) * 100% = 100%. The effective tax rate for FY2021 is 100%.\n\nThe effective tax rate for FY2022 can be calculated similarly. The income before tax for FY2022 is 7,514 + (13,474 - 13,474) = 7,514. The effective tax rate for FY2022 is (7,514 / (7,514 + 7,514)) * 100% = 100%. The effective tax rate for FY2022 is 100%., Explanation: The effective tax rate for FY2021 and FY2022 can be calculated by dividing the net income by the income before tax and then subtracting the result from 1. However, the income before tax is not directly provided in the given excerpt. We can infer the income before tax by adding the net income and the other comprehensive loss to the retained earnings., Citation: Net income 8,060 — — — — 8,060 Other comprehensive loss (50) — — — (50) — Preferred shares issued 1,584 — — 1,584 — — Redemption of preferred shares (1,600) — — (1,584) — (16) Repurchase of common shares (7,598) — (9) (631) — (6,958) Other changes, primarily employee plans 227 — 1 245 — (19) Cash dividends declared preferred Series B, $36,419.41 per share (27) — — — — (27) Cash dividends declared preferred Series C, $26,317.47 per share (23) — — — — (23) Cash dividends declared preferred Series D, $13,213.89 per share (21) — — — — (21) Cash dividends declared common, $1.72 per share (1,359) — — — — (1,359)\nChunk ID: 128, Answer: None, Explanation: The effective tax rate and related financial data for FY2021 and FY2022 are not explicitly mentioned in the provided document excerpt.

However, we can infer that the company's tax expense and income before tax are not explicitly stated. Therefore, we will focus on extracting the deferred card and other fees, net of deferred direct acquisition costs and reserves for membership cancellations, as of December 31, 2022., Citation: The carrying amount of deferred card and other fees, net of deferred direct acquisition costs and reserves for membership cancellations, as of December 31, 2022 was as follows:\n(Millions)\n2022\n2021\nDeferred card and other fees \n$3,380\n$2,838\nDeferred direct acquisition costs\n(173)\n(169)\nReserves for membership cancellations\n(180)\n(153)\nDeferred card and other fees, net\n$3,027\n$2,516\nChunk ID: 151, Answer: The effective tax rate for FY2021 is 24% ($78 million / $326 million) and for FY2022 is 24.3% ($90 million / $373 million)., Explanation: The effective tax rate and related financial data for FY2021 and FY2022 can be found in the income tax benefits section of the document., Citation: Stock-based compensation expense recognized in Salaries and employee benefits in the Consolidated Statements of Income was $373 million, $326 million and $247 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, with corresponding income tax benefits of $90 million, $78 million and $59 million in those respective periods.\nChunk ID: 152, Answer: The effective tax rate for FY2021 is approximately 14% ($14 million / $100 million), and for FY2022 is approximately 9% ($9 million / $100 million)., Explanation: The effective tax rate and related financial data for FY2021 and FY2022 can be found in the income tax benefit recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income., Citation: The income tax benefit recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income related to stock option exercises was $9 million, $14 million and $7 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nChunk ID: 153, Answer: None, Explanation: The effective tax rate and related financial data for FY2021 and FY2022 are not explicitly mentioned in the provided document excerpt. However, we can infer that the effective tax rate is not directly stated, but we can calculate it using the income before tax and income tax expense., Citation: None\nChunk ID: 156, Answer: None, Explanation: The effective tax rate and related financial data for FY2021 and FY2022 are not explicitly mentioned in the provided document excerpt. However, we can infer that the company is being challenged in various countries regarding their application of value-added taxes (VAT) to certain international transactions, which may impact their tax expenses., Citation: We are being challenged in a number of countries regarding our application of value-added taxes (VAT) to certain of our international transactions, which are in various stages of audit, or are being contested in legal actions.\nChunk ID: 160, Answer: None, Explanation: The effective tax rate and related financial data for FY2021 and FY2022 cannot be directly extracted from the provided text. However, we can infer the net income and income tax expense for FY2021 and FY2022 from the Consolidated Statements of Income., Citation: The following table presents the gains and losses recognized in Interest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income associated with the fair value hedges of our fixed-rate long-term debt for the years ended December 31:\nChunk ID: 161, Answer: The effective tax rate for FY2021 and FY2022 cannot be directly calculated from the provided information. However, we can infer that the effective tax rate for FY2021 was approximately 0% (since the net decrease of $256 million is not explicitly stated to be a tax expense, but rather a net decrease related to interest accruals on interest rate derivatives). For FY2022, the effective tax rate is also unknown, but we can see that the net decrease of $57 million is related to interest expense on long-term debt., Explanation: The effective tax rate and related financial data for FY2021 and FY2022 can be found in the Interest expense on Long-term debt section and the Net investment hedges section of the provided document excerpt., Citation: We recognized in Interest expense on Long-term debt a net decrease of $57 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and net decreases of $256 million for both the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nChunk ID: 162, Answer: Unfortunately, the provided excerpt does not contain the effective tax rate or related financial data for FY2021 and FY2022. However, we can see that there were gains of $4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, which were recognized in Service fees and other revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Income., Explanation: The effective tax rate and related financial data for FY2021 and FY2022 can be found in the income statements or tax notes., Citation: Service fees and other revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nChunk ID: 167, Answer: Unfortunately, the effective tax rate and related financial data for FY2021 and FY2022 are not available in the provided text., Explanation: The effective tax rate and related financial data for FY2021 and FY2022 were not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. However, we can infer the income before taxes and income taxes from the given information., Citation: We recorded unrealized gains of $94 million, $729 million and $113 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Unrealized losses representing impairments were $388 million, $2 million and $20 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nChunk ID: 168, Answer: None, Explanation: The effective tax rate and related financial data for FY2021 and FY2022 can be found in the income statement or tax notes, but since the provided excerpt does not contain the income statement, we will look for the tax notes or management discussion sections., Citation: \nChunk ID: 169, Answer: The effective tax rate for FY2021 is 90 million / (net income available to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2021) and for FY2022 is 75 million / (net income available to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2022). However, the net income available to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2022 is not provided in the given excerpt. The total tax impact for FY2021 and FY2022 is 90 million and 75 million respectively., Explanation: The effective tax rate and related financial data for FY2021 and FY2022 can be found in the tax notes section of the provided document excerpt., Citation: Tax expense (benefit) (Millions) 2022 2021 2020 Net unrealized (losses) gains on debt securities $ (27) $ (13) $ 9 Foreign currency translation adjustment, net of hedges 75 51 (62) Pension and other postretirement benefits 27 52 (28) Total tax impact $ 75 $ 90 $ (81)\nChunk ID: 170, Answer: The effective tax rate for FY2022 is 20.1% and for FY2021 is 20.9%, Explanation: The effective tax rate can be calculated by comparing the total income tax expense to the pre-tax income. However, the pre-tax income is not provided in the given excerpt. Therefore, we can only extract the effective tax rate using the reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory rate to the actual income tax rate., Citation: 2022: U.S. statutory federal income tax rate 21.0% - (Decrease) increase in taxes resulting from: Tax credits and tax-exempt income (0.9) = 20.1% \n 2021: U.S. statutory federal income tax rate 21.0% - (Decrease) increase in taxes resulting from: Tax credits and tax-exempt income (0.1) = 20.9%\nChunk ID: 171, Answer: The effective tax rate for FY2021 is not explicitly stated, but we can calculate it using the net income taxes paid and the net income. For FY2021, net income taxes paid were approximately $1.6 billion, and net income is not provided. However, we can find the effective tax rate for FY2022. Net income taxes paid were approximately $3.0 billion, and net income is not provided. We can also find the gross deferred tax assets and liabilities for FY2021 and FY2022, which can be used to estimate the effective tax rate. For FY2022, gross deferred tax assets were $5,592 million, and gross deferred tax liabilities were $1,550 million. The effective tax rate for FY2022 can be estimated as (net deferred tax assets / net income) * 100. However, since net income is not provided, we can use the net income taxes paid as a proxy. The effective tax rate for FY2022 can be estimated as (net income taxes paid / net income) * 100. Since we don't have the net income, we can use the gross deferred tax assets and liabilities to estimate the effective tax rate. The effective tax rate for FY2022 can be estimated as (gross deferred tax liabilities - gross deferred tax assets) / gross deferred tax assets * 100. Using this method, the effective tax rate for FY2022 is approximately (1,550 - 5,592) / 5,592 * 100 = -72.5%. However, this is not a realistic effective tax rate, as it is negative. A more realistic approach is to use the net deferred tax assets and liabilities. The effective tax rate for FY2022 can be estimated as (net deferred tax assets / net income) * 100. However, since net income is not provided, we can use the net income taxes paid as a proxy. The effective tax rate for FY2022 can be estimated as (net income taxes paid / net income) * 100. Since we don't have the net income, we can use the gross deferred tax assets and liabilities to estimate the effective tax rate. The effective tax rate for FY2022 can be estimated as (net deferred tax assets / gross deferred tax assets) * 100. Using this method, the effective tax rate for FY2022 is approximately 3,505 / 5,592 * 100 = 62.6%. The effective tax rate for FY2021 is not explicitly stated, but we can estimate it using the same method. The effective tax rate for FY2021 can be estimated as (net deferred tax assets / gross deferred tax assets) * 100. Using this method, the effective tax rate for FY2021 is approximately 2,385 / 5,203 * 100 = 45.9%., Explanation: The effective tax rate and related financial data for FY2021 and FY2022 can be found in the table of deferred tax assets and liabilities., Citation: Net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2022, and 2021, are $3,505 million and $2,385 million, respectively.\nChunk ID: 172, Answer: For FY2022, the effective tax rate would be favorably affected by approximately $750 million. For FY2021, the effective tax rate would be favorably affected by approximately $780 million., Explanation: The effective tax rate and related financial data for FY2021 and FY2022 can be found in the table presenting changes in unrecognized tax benefits., Citation: $1.0 billion and $0.8 billion for December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, are approximately $750 million, $780 million and $580 million, respectively, that, if recognized, would favorably affect the effective tax rate in a future period.\nChunk ID: 173, Answer: None, Explanation: The effective tax rate for FY2021 and FY2022 can be calculated by dividing the income tax expense by the pretax income. However, the provided text does not directly mention the income tax expense or pretax income for these years. Therefore, we will look for any information related to income tax expense or effective tax rate in the provided text., Citation: None\nChunk ID: 175, Answer: None, Explanation: The effective tax rate and related financial data for FY2021 and FY2022 can be found in the income statement or tax notes section, but since the provided excerpt does not contain these sections, we will look for any relevant information in the management discussion section., Citation: None\nChunk ID: 176, Answer: None, Explanation: The effective tax rate and related financial data for FY2021 and FY2022 are not explicitly mentioned in the provided document excerpt. However, we can infer that the company's tax expense and income before taxes are not directly available. We can look for information on income before taxes, which is necessary to calculate the effective tax rate., Citation: \nChunk ID: 177, Answer: For FY2021, the effective tax rate is calculated as (1 - (10,689 - 1,008) / 42,380) * 100 = 76.1%. The pretax income is $10,689 and the total revenues net of interest expense is $42,380. For FY2022, the effective tax rate is calculated as (1 - (9,585 - 2,227) / 52,862) * 100 = 95.8%. The pretax income is $9,585 and the total revenues net of interest expense is $52,862., Explanation: The effective tax rate and related financial data for FY2021 and FY2022 can be found in the income statements and management discussion sections., Citation: Pretax income (loss) and total revenues net of interest expense can be used to calculate the effective tax rate.\nChunk ID: 178, Answer: None, Explanation: The effective tax rate and related financial data for FY2021 and FY2022 cannot be directly extracted from the provided document excerpt. However, we can infer the pretax income (loss) for each year, which can be used to calculate the effective tax rate if the total tax expense is known., Citation: Pretax income (loss) for FY2021 and FY2022: 4,296 and 4,296 (note: the same value is provided for both years, suggesting a recast of prior period pretax income (loss) for FY2022).\nChunk ID: 179, Answer: Effective tax rate for FY2021: (248 / 10689) * 100 = -2.32%\nEffective tax rate for FY2022: (244 / 9585) * 100 = -2.54%, Explanation: The effective tax rate can be calculated by dividing the income tax benefit by the pretax income from continuing operations. Relevant information is found in the income statements for FY2021 and FY2022., Citation: Pretax income (loss) from continuing operations: 10,689 (FY2021), 9,585 (FY2022)\nIncome tax benefit: (248) (FY2021), (244) (FY2022)\nChunk ID: 180, Answer: Unfortunately, the provided document excerpt does not contain the necessary information to calculate the effective tax rate for FY2021 and FY2022. However, we can infer the net income for FY2021 and FY2022 from the net cash provided by operating activities and the adjustments to reconcile net income to cash provided by operating activities.\n\nFor FY2021: Net cash provided by operating activities = $8,297, Adjustments to reconcile net income to cash provided by operating activities = ($8,560) + $5,549 + $160 = -$2,851. Therefore, net income for FY2021 is $8,297 + $2,851 = $11,148.\n\nFor FY2022: Net cash provided by operating activities = $5,318, Adjustments to reconcile net income to cash provided by operating activities = ($7,905) + $5,549 + $160 = -$2,196. Therefore, net income for FY2022 is $5,318 + $2,196 = $7,514., Explanation: The effective tax rate and related financial data for FY2021 and FY2022 can be found in the income statement or tax notes section, but since the provided document excerpt does not contain these sections, we will look for relevant information in the cash flow statement., Citation: Net income is not directly provided in the cash flow statement, but we can infer the net income from the net cash provided by operating activities and the adjustments to reconcile net income to cash provided by operating activities.\nChunk ID: 182, Answer: None, Explanation: The required information is not directly provided in the given excerpt.

However, we can infer that the information might be available in the income statements, tax notes, or management discussion sections of the company's annual reports., Citation: \nChunk ID: 186, Answer: None, Explanation: The effective tax rate and related financial data for FY2021 and FY2022 are not explicitly mentioned in the provided document excerpt. However, we can infer that the information might be present in the income statements, tax notes, or management discussion sections of the company's annual reports., Citation: \nChunk ID: 188, Answer: The U.S. federal statutory tax rate used for FY2021 and FY2022 is 21 percent., Explanation: The effective tax rate and related financial data for FY2021 and FY2022 can be found in the footnote related to the calculation of average yields for non-taxable investment securities., Citation: (c) Average yields for both taxable and non-taxable investment securities have been calculated using amortized cost balances and do not include changes in fair value recorded in other comprehensive loss. Average yield on non-taxable investment securities is calculated on a tax-equivalent basis using the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21 percent for 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nChunk ID: 189, Answer: None, Explanation: The effective tax rate and related financial data for FY2021 and FY2022 are not explicitly mentioned in the provided excerpts. However, we can infer the income before taxes and income taxes from the 'Interest Expense' and 'Net Interest Income' sections., Citation: Interest Expense and Net Interest Income sections\nChunk ID: 193, Answer: None, Explanation: The effective tax rate and related financial data for FY2021 and FY2022 are not explicitly mentioned in the provided document excerpt. However, we can infer the income before taxes and income taxes from the 'Allocation of Reserve for Credit Losses' table, which shows the reserve for credit losses allocated to Card Member loans, Card Member receivables, and Other loans., Citation: December 31, 2022 2021 (Millions, except percentages) Reserve for credit losses at end of year applicable to Amount Percentage Amount Percentage Card Member loans $3,747 93% $3,305 97% Card Member receivables 229 6 64 2 Other loans 59 1 52 1 Total Reserve for credit losses $4,035 100% $3,421 100%\nChunk ID: 196, Answer: The applicable federal rate (AFR) for FY2021 is 120% of the AFR for December 2019, and for FY2022 is 120% of the AFR for December 2020. However, the actual AFR values for these years are not provided in the document excerpt., Explanation: The effective tax rate and related financial data for FY2021 and FY2022 are not explicitly mentioned in the provided document excerpt. However, we can infer the applicable federal rate (AFR) for FY2021 and FY2022, which is linked to the AFR-Based Option., Citation: The applicable federal rate (AFR) is linked to 120% of the applicable federal rate (the 'AFR-Based Option')\nChunk ID: 209, Answer: None, Explanation: The effective tax rate and related financial data for FY2021 and FY2022 are not explicitly mentioned in the provided document excerpt. However, the document does mention the 'AFR' (Annual Funding Requirement) which is related to the interest credit method for crediting earnings on Formerly Grandfathered Deferral Benefits., Citation: For the portion of 2012 prior to the date of payment, earnings on Formerly Grandfathered Deferral Benefits shall be credited with earnings at the AFR.\nChunk ID: 210, Answer: None, Explanation: The provided text does not contain financial data for FY2021 and FY2022, but it does mention the applicable federal long-term rate (AFR) which is used to calculate earnings on Deferral Benefits., Citation: The AFR is defined as 120% of the applicable federal long-term rate for December of the prior Plan Year, as prescribed under Section 1274(d) of the Code.\nChunk ID: 233, Answer: None, Explanation: The provided text does not contain financial data for FY2021 and FY2022. However, it does mention the Alternative Financial Rate (AFR) which is related to financial data. Unfortunately, the AFR is not specified for FY2021 and FY2022., Citation: The text does not mention FY2021 and FY2022, but it does mention the AFR in Section 3(b): 'and provided, however, that earnings credited in 2010 (to the extent not paid out by October 27, 2010) will not exceed the AFR if Amex’s ROE is Below ROE Target Range; and provided further that for those Executive Officers who received payment in the 2010 Plan Year prior to October 27, 2010, earnings on the amounts paid prior to October 27, 2010 were calculated based on the Interest Method without reference to any AFR limitation.'\nChunk ID: 249, Answer: None, Explanation: The effective tax rate and related financial data for FY2021 and FY2022 are not explicitly mentioned in the provided document excerpt.

However, we can infer that the highest marginal rate of federal income taxation and state and local income taxes are used to calculate the tax rate., Citation: The Firm will be paid reasonable compensation by the Company for its services. (i) As soon as practicable following a Change in Control, but in no event later than 30 days thereafter, the Company shall provide to each Participant with respect to whom it is proposed that Payments be reduced, a written statement setting forth the manner in which the Total Payments in respect of such Participant were calculated and the basis for such calculations, including, without limitation, any opinions or other advice the Company has received from the Firm or other advisors or consultants (and any such opinions or advice which are in writing shall be attached to the statement).\nChunk ID: 259, Answer: None, Explanation: The provided text does not contain income statements, tax notes, or management discussion sections for FY2021 and FY2022. However, it does mention 'Amex's consolidated annual return on equity for such calendar year' which could be related to the return on equity (ROE) for the company., Citation: Amex's 'ROE' for a calendar year means Amex's consolidated annual return on equity for such calendar year, as reported by Amex, subject to adjustment for significant accounting changes as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion.\nChunk ID: 274, Answer: None, Explanation: The effective tax rate and related financial data for FY2021 and FY2022 are not explicitly mentioned in the provided document excerpt.

      "output": "From the collected outputs, we have gathered several pieces of information regarding the effective tax rates for American Express for FY2021 and FY2022. Here are the key findings:\n\n1. **Effective Tax Rates Identified:**\n   - Chunk ID 71 and 65 both mention that the effective tax rate for FY2022 was 21.6% and for FY2021 was 24.6%. This is consistent across these chunks and provides a clear comparison.\n   - Chunk ID 123 also supports this with a slight variation, stating FY2021: 24.6% and FY2022: 21.7%.\n\n2. **Other Calculations and Inferences:**\n   - Some chunks attempted to calculate the effective tax rate using different methods or assumptions, leading to varying results. For example, Chunk ID 74 calculated different rates based on inferred data, but these do not align with the more consistent findings from other chunks.\n\n3. **Sufficient Information:**\n   - The consistent information from multiple chunks (IDs 71, 65, and 123) provides a reliable basis to answer the question. The effective tax rate decreased from 24.6% in FY2021 to approximately 21.6% in FY2022.\n\n4. **Calculation of Change:**\n   - The change in the effective tax rate can be calculated as: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Change} = 24.6\\% - 21.6\\% = 3.0\\%\n     \\]\n   - This indicates a decrease of 3.0 percentage points in the effective tax rate from FY2021 to FY2022.\n\n5. **Conflicting Information:**\n   - While there are conflicting calculations in some chunks, the consistent data from chunks with clear citations (e.g., income statement sections) should be prioritized. The cited sections in chunks 71 and 65 provide a more reliable source for the effective tax rates.\n\nIn conclusion, the effective tax rate for American Express decreased by 3.0 percentage points from FY2021 to FY2022, based on the most consistent and cited data available."
