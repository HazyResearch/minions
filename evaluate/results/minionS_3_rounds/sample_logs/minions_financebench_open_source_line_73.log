--- Question ---
How much has the effective tax rate of Corning changed between FY2021 and FY2022?

--- Predicted Answer ---
The effective tax rate of Corning increased by 2.7 percentage points from FY2021 to FY2022.

--- Ground Truth ---
['The effective tax rate of Corning has changed from 20% in FY2021 to 23% in FY 2022.']

--- Correctness Evaluation ---
Is correct: False
Confidence: 0.80
Reasoning: The ground truth states the effective tax rate changed from 20% to 23%, which is a 3 percentage point increase. The predicted answer states a 2.7 percentage point increase. The difference of 0.3 percentage points is outside the 10% tolerance range (0.3 is more than 10% of 3), so the predicted answer is incorrect.
