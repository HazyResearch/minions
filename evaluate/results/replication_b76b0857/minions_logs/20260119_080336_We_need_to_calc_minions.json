      "output": "To calculate Nike's three-year average of cost of goods sold (COGS) as a percentage of revenue from FY2016 to FY2018, focus on extracting specific financial data from the statement of income for each fiscal year. You need to identify the total revenue and the cost of goods sold figures for FY2016, FY2017, and FY2018. Once you have these figures, calculate the COGS as a percentage of revenue for each year by dividing the COGS by the total revenue and multiplying by 100 to convert it to a percentage. After obtaining the percentages for each year, find the average of these three percentages to determine the three-year average. Ensure that all calculations are rounded to one decimal place for precision."

      "prompt": "# Decomposition Round #1\n\nYou (the supervisor) cannot directly read the document(s). Instead, you can assign small, isolated tasks to a less capable worker model that sees only a single chunk of text at a time. Any cross-chunk or multi-document reasoning must be handled by you.\n\n## Your Job: Write Two Python Functions\n\n### FUNCTION #1: `prepare_jobs(context, prev_job_manifests, prev_job_outputs) -> List[JobManifest]`\n- Break the document(s) into chunks (using the provided chunking function, if needed). Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 12 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`. All **multi-chunk integration** or **global reasoning** is your responsibility here.\n- Return one **aggregated string** suitable for further supervisor inspection.\n\n\n\n## Relevant Pydantic Models\n\nThe following models are already in the global scope. **Do NOT redefine or re-import them.**\n\n### JobManifest Model\n```\nclass JobManifest(BaseModel):\n    chunk: str  # the actual text for the chunk of the document\n    task: str  # the actual task instruction for the small model\n    advice: str  # optional, any additional advice on how to perform the task\n\n    chunk_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    task_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    job_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n\n```\n\n### JobOutput Model\n```\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    citation: Optional[str]\n    answer: Optional[str]\n\n```\n\n## Function Signatures\n```\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        context (List[str]): A list of documents.

The administration has also targeted the specific practices of certain U.S. multinational corporations in public statements which, if\ndirected at us, could harm our reputation or otherwise negatively impact our business.\nIn addition, disease outbreaks, terrorist acts and military conflict have increased the risks of doing business abroad.

Adjustments to the\nincremental provisional tax expense may be made in future periods as actual amounts may differ due to, among other factors, a change in interpretation of the applicable\nrevisions to the U.S. tax code and related tax accounting guidance, changes in assumptions made in developing these estimates, regulatory guidance that may be issued with\nrespect to the applicable revisions to the U.S. tax code, and state tax implications. As we complete our analysis of the Tax Act, we may make adjustments to provisional\namounts we have recorded, which could negatively impact our business, results of operations or financial condition. Changes or challenges to or the repeal of the Tax Act\ncannot be predicted with certainty and could have a material impact on our future tax expense.\nWe earn a substantial portion of our income in foreign countries and are subject to the tax laws of those jurisdictions. There have been proposals to reform foreign tax laws that\ncould significantly impact how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings.

If the tax holidays and rulings are not extended, or if we\nfail to satisfy the conditions of the reduced tax rate, our effective income tax rate would increase in the future.\nWe are also subject to the examination of our tax returns by the United States Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and other tax authorities.

Our  goal  is  to  deliver  value  to  our\nshareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear, apparel, equipment and accessories businesses. Our strategy is to achieve long-term revenue growth\nby creating innovative, “must have” products, building deep personal consumer connections with our brands and delivering compelling consumer experiences through digital\nplatforms and at retail.\nIn June 2017, we announced the Consumer Direct Offense, a new company alignment designed to allow NIKE to better serve the consumer personally, at scale. Leveraging\nthe power of digital, NIKE plans to drive growth — by accelerating innovation and product creation, moving even closer to the consumer through key cities, and deepening one-\nto-one connections. As  a result  of  this  organizational  realignment,  beginning  in  fiscal  2018,  the  Company’s  reportable  operating  segments  for  the  NIKE  Brand  are:  North\nAmerica; Europe, Middle East & Africa (EMEA); Greater China; and Asia Pacific & Latin America (APLA).\nThrough the Consumer Direct Offense, we are focusing on our Triple Double strategy, with the objective of doubling the impact of innovation, increasing our speed to market\nand growing our direct connections with consumers. As a result of the execution of this strategy, our long-term financial goals through fiscal 2023, on average, per year, are as\nfollows:\n•\nHigh single-digit revenue growth;\n•\nGross margin expansion of as much as 50 basis points ;\n•\nSlight selling and administrative expense leverage;\n•\nMid-teens earnings per share growth; and\n•\nLow-thirties percentage rate of return on invested capital.\nOver the past ten years, we have achieved strong growth in many of these metrics. During this time, revenues for NIKE, Inc. have grown 7% on an annual compounded basis,\nannual gross margin has ranged from 43.5% to 46.4%, diluted earnings per common share has grown steadily and our return on invested capital has been as high as 34.7%.\nOur fiscal 2018 results demonstrated the power of the NIKE, Inc. portfolio to generate revenue growth, while investing in capabilities in support of our Triple Double strategy to\nfuel our next phase of long-term growth and profitability. We achieved record revenues for fiscal 2018, growing 6% to $36.4 billion. The NIKE Brand, which represents over\n90%  of  NIKE,  Inc. Revenues ,  delivered  7%  revenue  growth.  On  a  currency-neutral  basis,  NIKE  Brand  revenues  grew  5%,  driven  by  strong  revenue  growth  across  all\ninternational geographies and NIKE Direct, as well as growth in footwear, apparel and most key categories. Revenues for Converse decreased 8% and 11% on a reported and\ncurrency-neutral basis, respectively, primarily driven by lower revenues in North America.\nIncome before income taxes decreased 11% for fiscal 2018, in part reflecting the negative impact of weakening foreign currency exchange rates. Revenue growth was more\nthan offset by higher sellin",

NIKE, Inc. gross\nmargin  decreased  80  basis  points  primarily  due  to  foreign  currency  exchange  rate  headwinds.  Selling  and  administrative  expense  was  higher  as  a  percent  of  revenues,\nreflecting investments in digital capabilities, consumer experiences and product and brand marketing to drive long-term growth under the Consumer Direct Offense.\nDiluted earnings per common share reflects a 2% decline in the weighted average diluted common shares outstanding, driven by our share repurchase program.\nWhile foreign currency markets remain volatile, we continue to see opportunities to drive future growth and profitability, and remain committed to effectively managing our\nbusiness to achieve our financial goals over the long-term by executing against the operational strategies outlined above.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThroughout  this  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K,  we  discuss  non-GAAP  financial  measures,  including  references  to  wholesale  equivalent  revenues  and  currency-neutral\nrevenues, which should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, the financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). References to wholesale equivalent revenues are intended to provide context as to the total size of our NIKE Brand\nmarket footprint if we had no NIKE Direct operations. NIKE Brand wholesale equivalent revenues consist of (1) sales to external wholesale customers and (2) internal sales\nfrom  our  wholesale  operations  to  our  NIKE  Direct  operations,  which  are  charged  at  prices  comparable  to  those  charged  to  external  wholesale  customers.  Additionally,\ncurrency-neutral revenues are calculated using actual exchange rates in use during the comparative prior year period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends\nexcluding the impact of translation arising from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nManagement uses these non-GAAP financial measures when evaluating the Company ’ s performance, including when making financial and operating decisions. Additionally,\nmanagement believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with additional financial information that should be considered when assessing our underlying\nbusiness  performance  and  trends.  However,  references  to  wholesale  equivalent  revenues  and  currency-neutral  revenues  should  not  be  considered  in  isolation  or  as  a\nsubstitute for other financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by\nother companies.\n20\n\n\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\n \n(Dollars in millions, except per share data)\nFiscal 2018\nFiscal 2017\n% Change\nFiscal 2016\n% Change\nRevenu",

Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are:\n•\nProduct Costs — NIKE’s product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways:\n1.\nProduct purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity:\na.\nCertain  NIKE  entities  purchase  product  from  the  NTC,  a  wholly-owned  sourcing  hub  that  buys  NIKE  branded  products  from  third-party  factories,\npredominantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the products to NIKE entities in their respective functional\ncurrencies. NTC sales to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency result in a foreign currency exposure for the NTC.\nb.\nOther NIKE entities purchase product directly from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those\nNIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar.\nIn both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U.S. Dollar decreases inventory costs incurred by NIKE whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar increases its cost.\n2.\nFactory input costs: NIKE operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign\ncurrency risk by assuming certain of the factories’ foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures.\nUnder this program, our payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies (“factory currency exposure index”) in which the\nlabor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products (“factory input costs”) are denominated.\nFor the currency within the factory currency exposure indices that is the local or functional currency of the factory, the currency rate fluctuation affecting the",

In certain\ncases,  the  Company  has  entered  into  contractual  agreements  which  have  payments  indexed  to  foreign  currencies  that  create  embedded  derivative  contracts\nrecorded at fair value through   Other expense (income), net .

Our post invoice sales discounts consist of contractual programs with certain customers or discretionary discounts expected to be granted to certain\ncustomers  at  a  later  date.

In general, endorsement payments are expensed on a straight-line\nbasis over the term of the contract. However, certain contract elements may be accounted for differently based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract.\nCertain contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports (e.g., winning a championship). We record demand creation\nexpense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal.\nCertain contracts provide for variable payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time (e.g., maintaining a\nspecified ranking in a sport for a year). When we determine payments are probable, the amounts are reported in Demand creation expense ratably over the contract period\nbased on our best estimate of the endorser’s performance. In these instances, to the extent actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the\nendorser’s performance, adjustments to Demand creation expense may be recorded in a future period.\n37\n\n\nTable of Contents\nCertain contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percent of sales of particular products. We expense these payments in Cost of sales\nas the related sales occur. In certain contracts, we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payments.

If such facts indicate a potential impairment, we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group\nexceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the\nprimary asset in the asset group.

Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the\nasset group’s carrying amount and its estimated fair value.\nHedge Accounting for Derivatives\nWe  use  derivative  contracts  to  hedge  certain  anticipated  foreign  currency  and  interest  rate  transactions  as  well  as  certain  non-functional  currency  monetary  assets  and\nliabilities. When the specific criteria to qualify for hedge accounting has been met, changes in the fair value of contracts hedging probable forecasted future cash flows are\nrecorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income , rather than Net income , until the underlying hedged transaction affects Net income . In most cases, this results in\ngains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from Other comprehensive income into Net income sometime after the maturity of the derivative. One of the criteria for\nthis accounting treatment is that the notional value of these derivative contracts should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions. By their very nature,\nour estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions. When anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction\namounts decline below hedged levels, or if it is no longer probable a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional\ntwo-month period of time thereafter, we are required to reclassify the cumulative change in fair value of the over-hedged portion of the related hedge contract from Other\ncomprehensive income to Other expense (income), net during the quarter in which the decrease occurs.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe account for stock-based compensation by estimating the fair value of stock-based compensation on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The\nBlack-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including volatility. Expected volatility is estimated based on implied volatility in market\ntraded options on our common stock with a term greater than one year, along with other factors. Our decision to use implied volatility was based on the availability of actively\ntraded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. If factors change and\nwe use different assumptions for estimating stock-based compensation expense in future periods, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from\nthat recorded in the current period.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to taxation in the United States, as well as various state and foreign jurisdictions.

On an interim basis, we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal\nyear. This estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the year-to-date Income before income taxes excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items, to determine\nthe year-to-date Income tax expense . The income tax effects  of infrequent  or unusual items are recognized  in the interim period in which they occur. As the fiscal year\nprogresses, we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year.

When this occurs, we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs.\nWe record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, when necessary. Realization of deferred tax assets (such as net operating loss carry-forwards) is dependent\non future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain. At least quarterly, we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable\nincome. To the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset, which increases our Income tax expense in\nthe period when such determination is made.\nOn a quarterly basis, we evaluate the probability a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions based\non factors including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, settled audit issues and new audit activity.

We have, in the past, and may in the future, also use forward or options contracts to hedge our investment in the\nnet assets of certain international  subsidiaries  to offset  foreign currency translation  adjustments  related to our net investment  in those subsidiaries.  Where exposures are\nhedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe timing for hedging exposures, as well as the type and duration of the hedge instruments employed, are guided by our hedging policies and determined based upon the\nnature of the exposure and prevailing market conditions. Typically, the Company may enter into hedge contracts starting up to 12 to 24 months in advance of the forecasted\ntransaction and may place incremental hedges up to 100% of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs. The majority of derivatives outstanding as of May 31,\n2018 are designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges, primarily for Euro/U.S. Dollar, British Pound/Euro and Japanese Yen/U.S. Dollar currency pairs. Refer to Note 16 —\nRisk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nOur earnings are also exposed to movements in short- and long-term market interest rates. Our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of\ninterest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we maintain a mix of commercial paper, bank loans, and\nfixed-rate debt of varying maturities.\nMarket Risk Measurement\nWe monitor foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value, sensitivity analysis and Value-at-\nRisk (“VaR”). Our market-sensitive derivative and other financial instruments are foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts, interest rate swaps,\nintercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies, fixed interest rate U.S. Dollar denominated debt and fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt.\nWe use VaR to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only. The VaR determines the maximum\npotential one-day loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate-sensitive financial instruments. The VaR model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95%\nconfidence level. There are various modeling techniques that can be used in the VaR computation. Our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and\ninterest rates (a “variance/co-variance” technique). These interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the\npreceding one-year period.

We adjust the potential\nloss in option value for the estimated sensitivity (the “delta” and “gamma”) to changes in the underlying currency rate. This calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency\nrate fluctuations on the derivative instruments  only and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations  on non-functional  currency transactions  (such as anticipated\ntransactions, firm commitments, cash balances and accounts and loans receivable and payable), including those which are hedged by these instruments.\nThe VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value we will incur nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in\nmarket rates. It also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur. Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or\ndifferences in market rates and interrelationships, hedging instruments and hedge percentages, timing and other factors.\nThe estimated maximum one-day loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments, derived using the VaR model, was $93 million and $97\nmillion  at  May  31,  2018  and  2017,  respectively.  The  VAR  decreased  year-over-year  as  a  result  of  a  decrease  in  foreign  currency  volatilities  at  May  31,  2018.  Such  a\nhypothetical loss in the fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged. The average monthly change in the\nfair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was $260 million and $161 million during fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively.\nThe instruments not included in the VaR are intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies, fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt, fixed interest\nrate U.S. Dollar denominated debt and interest rate swaps.

Furthermore, our non-functional\ncurrency intercompany loans are substantially hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts, which are included in the VaR calculation above.\nTherefore, we consider the interest rate and foreign currency market risks associated with our non-functional currency intercompany loans to be immaterial to our consolidated\nfinancial position, results from operations and cash flows.\nDetails of third-party debt are provided in the table below.

In some markets outside the U.S., these trademarks are licensed to third parties who design, distribute, market and sell similar\nproducts. Operating results of the Converse brand are reported on a stand-alone basis.\nBasis of Consolidation\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of NIKE, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”). All significant intercompany transactions and balances have\nbeen eliminated.\nOn November 19, 2015, the Company announced a two -for-one split of both NIKE Class A and Class B Common Stock. The stock split was in the form of a 100 percent stock\ndividend payable on December 23, 2015 to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 9, 2015. Common stock began trading at the split-adjusted price on\nDecember 24, 2015. All share and per share amounts presented reflect the stock split.\nReclassifications\nCertain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to fiscal 2018 presentation, including reclassified geographic operating segment data to reflect the changes in the\nCompany’s operating structure, which became effective on June 1, 2017. Refer to Note 17 — Operating Segments and Related Information for additional information.\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, management identified a misstatement related to the historical allocation of repurchases of Class B Common stock between Capital in\nexcess of stated value and Retained earnings . The Company assessed the materiality of these misstatements on prior period financial statements in accordance with U.S.\nSecurities  and  Exchange  Commission Staff  Accounting  Bulletin  No.  99,  Materiality,  codified  in  ASC  250,  Presentation  of  Financial  Statements,  and  concluded  that  these\nmisstatements were not material to any prior annual or interim period. As such, the Company has revised the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of May 31, 2017 , and has\nreduced Capital in excess of stated value by $2.9 billion and increased Retained earnings by the same amount. Within the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity,\nthe Company has made corresponding revisions of $2.6 billion , $0.1 billion and $0.2 billion for the periods ended May 31, 2015, 2016 and, 2017, respectively.\nRevenue Recognition\nWholesale revenues are recognized when title and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer, based on the terms of sale. This occurs upon shipment or\nupon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. Retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale and digital\ncommerce revenues are recorded upon delivery to the customer. Amounts collected from custom",

Estimates  of\ndiscretionary discounts, returns and claims are based on (1) historical rates, (2) specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from\ncustomers and (3) estimated discounts, returns and claims expected, but not yet finalized with customers. As of May 31, 2018 and 2017 , the Company’s reserve balances for\npost-invoice sales discounts, returns and miscellaneous claims were $675 million and $643 million , respectively.\nCost of Sales\nCost of sales consists primarily of inventory costs, as well as warehousing costs (including the cost of warehouse labor), third-party royalties, certain foreign currency hedge\ngains and losses and product design costs. Outbound shipping and handling costs are expensed as incurred and included in Cost of sales .\nDemand Creation Expense\nDemand  creation  expense consists  of  advertising  and  promotion  costs,  including  costs  of  endorsement  contracts,  complimentary  product,  television,  digital  and  print\nadvertising and media costs, brand events and retail brand presentation.

Costs related  to brand events  are expensed  when the event occurs.  Costs  related to retail  brand presentation  are\nexpensed when the presentation is complete and delivered.\nA significant  amount of the Company’s promotional expenses result from payments under endorsement  contracts.  In general, endorsement  payments are expensed on a\nstraight-line basis over the term of the contract. However, certain contract elements may be accounted for differently based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual\ncontract. Prepayments made under contracts are included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets or Deferred income taxes and other assets depending on the period to\nwhich the prepayment applies.\nCertain  contracts  provide  for  contingent  payments  to  endorsers  based  upon  specific  achievements  in  their  sports  (e.g.,  winning  a  championship).

The Company expenses these payments in\nCost of sales as the related sales occur. In certain contracts, the Company offers minimum guaranteed royalty payments. For contracts the Company estimates will not meet\nthe minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product, the Company records the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales\nof product in Demand creation expense uniformly over the contract period.\nThrough cooperative advertising programs, the Company reimburses customers for certain costs of advertising the Company’s products. The Company records these costs in\nDemand creation expense at the point in time when it is obligated to its customers for the costs. This obligation may arise prior to the related advertisement being run.\nTotal advertising and promotion expenses, which the Company refers to as Demand creation expense, were $3,577 million , $3,341 million and $3,278 million for the years\nended May  31,  2018 , 2017 and 2016 ,  respectively.

The Company makes ongoing estimates relating to the collectability of its accounts receivable\nand maintains an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. In determining the amount of the allowance, the\nCompany considers historical levels of credit losses and makes judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations.

Costs  associated  with\npreliminary project stage activities, training, maintenance and all other post-implementation stage activities are expensed as incurred.\nComputer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed : Development costs of computer software to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed as an integral part of a\nproduct are subject to capitalization beginning when a product’s technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to\ncustomers. In most instances, the Company’s products are released soon after technological feasibility has been established. Therefore, software development costs incurred\nsubsequent to achievement of technological feasibility are usually not significant, and generally most software development costs have been expensed as incurred.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company reviews the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying\namount of the assets might not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in\nwhich an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable\nmarket value of an asset, among others. If such facts indicate a potential impairment, the Company would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the\ncarrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the\nremaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, the Company\nwill estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies, which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. Any impairment\nwould be measured as the difference between the asset group’s carrying amount and its estimated fair value.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nThe  Company  performs",

Events or\nchanges in circumstances that may trigger interim impairment reviews include significant changes in business climate, operating results, planned investments in the reporting\nunit, planned divestitures or an expectation the carrying amount may not be recoverable, among other factors. The Company may first assess qualitative factors to determine\nwhether it is more likely than not the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, the Company\ndetermines  it  is  more  likely  than  not  the  fair  value  of  the  reporting  unit  is  greater  than  its  carrying  amount,  the  two-step  impairment  test  is  unnecessary.  The  two-step\nimpairment test first requires the Company to estimate the fair value of its reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the goodwill of that\nreporting unit is potentially impaired and the Company proceeds to step two of the impairment analysis. In step two of the analysis, the Company measures and records an\nimpairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill over its implied fair value, if any.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of acquired trade names and trademarks. The Company may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is\nmore likely than not an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, the C ompany determines it is more likely than\nnot that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is not impaired, no quantitative fair value measurement is necessary. If a quantitative fair value measurement calculation is required\nfor these intangible assets, the Company utilizes the relief-from-royalty method. This method assumes trade names and trademarks have value to the extent their owner is\nrelieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them. This method requires the Company to estimate the future revenue for the related brands, the\nappropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital.\nOperating Leases\nThe  Company  leases  retail  store  space,  certain  distribution  and  warehouse  facilities,  office  space,  equipment  and  other  non-real  estate  assets  under  operating  leases.\nOperating lease agreements may contain rent escalation clauses, renewal options, rent holidays or certain landlord incentives, including tenant improvement allowances.

A  contingent  rent  liability  is  recognized  together  with  the\ncorresponding rent expense when specified levels have been achieved or when the Company determines that achieving the specified levels during the period is probable.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis, including derivatives and available-for-sale securities. Fair value is the price the\nCompany would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date. The Company uses a three-\nlevel hierarchy established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) that prioritizes fair value measurements based on the types of inputs used for the various\nvaluation techniques (market approach, income approach and cost approach).\n52\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:\n•\nLevel 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n•\nLevel 2: Inputs other than observable quoted prices for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; these include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in\nactive markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.\n•\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs with little or no market data available, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.\nThe Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or\nliability. Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the most conservative level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nPricing vendors are utilized for a majority of Level 1 and Level 2 investments. These vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs\nwithout applying significant adjustments in their pricing. Observable inputs include broker quotes, interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals,\nvolatilities and credit risks. The fair value of derivative contracts is determined using observable market inputs such as the daily market foreign currency rates, forward pricing\ncurves, currency volatilities, currency correlations and interest rates and considers nonperformance risk of the Company and its counterparties.\nLevel 1 investments include U.S. Treasury securities.

The Company adopted the ASU in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.\nThe  updated  guidance  requires  excess  tax  benefits  and  deficiencies  from  share-based  payment  awards  to  be  recorded  in  income  tax  expense  in  the  income  statement.\nPreviously, excess tax benefits and deficiencies were recognized in shareholders’ equity on the balance sheet. This change is required to be applied prospectively. As a result\nof the adoption, during fiscal 2018, the Company recognized  $230 million of excess tax benefits related to share-based payment awards in  Income tax expense  in the\nConsolidated Statements of Income.\nAdditionally, ASU 2016-09 modified the classification of certain share-based payment activities within the statement of cash flows, which the Company applied retrospectively.\nAs a result, for fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, the Company reclassified cash inflows of  $177 million and $281 million , respectively, related to excess tax benefits from share-\nbased payment awards, from  Cash used by financing activities  to  Cash provided by operations , and reclassified cash outflows of  $29 million  and $22 million , for the\nrespective periods, related to tax payments for the net settlement of share-based payment awards, from  Cash provided by operations  to  Cash used by financing activities\n within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nIn August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12,  Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities , which expands and\nrefines hedge accounting for both financial and non-financial risk components, aligns the recognition and presentation of the effects of hedging instruments and hedge items in\nthe financial statements, and includes certain targeted improvements to ease the application of current guidance related to the assessment of hedge effectiveness.

In all situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued and the derivative remains outstanding, the Company will account for the derivative as an undesignated\ninstrument as discussed below.\nThe purpose of the Company ’ s foreign exchange risk management program is to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on the Company ’ s\nconsolidated  results  of  operations,  financial  position  and  cash  flows.  Foreign  currency  exposures  the  Company  may  elect  to  hedge  in  this  manner  include  product  cost\nexposures, non-functional currency denominated external and intercompany revenues, selling and administrative expenses, investments in U.S. Dollar-denominated available-\nfor-sale debt securities and certain other intercompany transactions.\nProduct  cost  exposures  are  primarily  generated  through  non-functional  currency  denominated  product  purchases  and  the  foreign  currency  adjustment  program  described\nbelow. NIKE entities primarily purchase products in two ways: (1) Certain NIKE entities purchase product from the NIKE Trading Company (NTC), a wholly owned sourcing hub\nthat buys NIKE branded products from third party factories, predominantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the product to\nNIKE entities in their respective functional currencies. NTC sales to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency results in a foreign currency exposure for the NTC. (2)\nOther NIKE entities purchase product directly from third party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a\nfunctional currency other than the U.S. Dollar.\nThe Company operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming\ncertain  of  the  factories’  foreign  currency  exposures,  some  of  which  are  natural  offsets  to  the  Company ’ s  existing  foreign  currency  exposures.  Under  this  program,  the\nCompany’s payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies (“factory currency exposure index”) in which the labor, materials and\noverhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products (“factory input costs”) are denominated. For the portion of the indices denominated in the\nlocal or functional currency of the factory, the Company may elect to place formally designated cash flow hedges. For all currencies wit",

Embedded derivative\ncontracts are separated from the related purchase order, as further described within the Embedded Derivatives section below.\nThe Company’s policy permits the utilization of derivatives to reduce its foreign currency exposures where internal netting or other strategies cannot be effectively employed.\nTypically, the Company may enter into hedge contracts starting up to 12 to 24 months in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental hedges up to 100%\nof the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs. The total notional amount of outstanding foreign currency derivatives designated as cash flow hedges was \n$12.2 billion  as of May 31, 2018 .\nAs of May 31, 2018 , $96 million of deferred net gains (net of tax) on both outstanding and matured derivatives in Accumulated other comprehensive income are expected to be\nreclassified to Net income during  the  next  12  months  concurrent  with  the  underlying  hedged  transactions  also  being  recorded  in Net income .  Actual  amounts  ultimately\nreclassified to Net income are dependent on the exchange rates in effect when derivative contracts currently outstanding mature. As of May 31, 2018 , the maximum term over\nwhich the Company is hedging exposures to the variability of cash flows for its forecasted transactions was 24 months.\nFair Value Hedges\nThe Company has, in the past, been exposed to the risk of changes in the fair value of certain fixed-rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates. Derivatives used by the\nCompany to hedge this risk are receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps. All interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges of the related long-term debt meet the\nshortcut method requirements under U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, changes in the fair values of the interest rate swaps are considered to exactly offset changes in the fair value of\nthe underlying long-term debt. The Company recorded no ineffectiveness from its interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges for the years ended May 31, 2018 , 2017\nor 2016 .

The total notional amount of outstanding undesignated derivative instruments was  $6.1 billion  as of  May 31, 2018 .\nEmbedded Derivatives\nAs part of the foreign currency adjustment program described above, an embedded derivative contract is created upon the factory’s acceptance of NIKE’s purchase order for\ncurrencies within the factory currency exposure indices that are neither the U.S. Dollar nor the local or functional currency of the factory. In addition, embedded derivative\ncontracts are created when the Company enters into certain other contractual agreements which have payments that are indexed to currencies that are not the functional\ncurrency  of  either  substantial  party  to  the  contracts.  Embedded  derivative  contracts  are  treated  as  foreign  currency  forward  contracts  that  are  bifurcated  from  the  related\npurchase order and recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with their corresponding change in fair value recognized in \nOther expense (income), net , through the date the foreign currency fluctuations cease to exist.\nAt May 31, 2018 , the total notional amount of all embedded derivatives outstanding was approximately $260 million .\nCredit Risk\nThe Company is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to hedging instruments. The counterparties to all derivative transactions are\nmajor financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings; however, this does not eliminate the Company’s exposure to credit risk with these institutions. This credit risk is\nlimited to the unrealized gains in such contracts should any of these counterparties fail to perform as contracted. To manage this risk, the Company has established strict\ncounterparty credit guidelines that are continually monitored.\nThe Company’s derivative contracts contain credit risk-related contingent features designed to protect against significant deterioration in counterparties’ creditworthiness and\ntheir ultimate ability to settle outstanding derivative contracts in the normal course of business.

The NIKE Brand segments are defined by geographic regions for\noperations participating in NIKE Brand sales activity.\nEach NIKE Brand geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel and equipment. In\nJune 2017, NIKE, Inc. announced a new company alignment designed to allow NIKE to better serve the consumer personally, at scale. As a result of this organizational\nrealignment, the Company’s reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America; Europe, Middle East & Africa; Greater China; and Asia Pacific & Latin\nAmerica, and include results for the NIKE, Jordan and Hurley brands. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to fiscal 2018 presentation. This includes\nreclassified operating segment data to reflect the changes in the Company’s operating structure, which became effective June 1, 2017. These changes had no impact on\npreviously reported consolidated statements of income, balance sheets, statements of cash flows or statements of shareholders’ equity.\nThe Company’s NIKE Direct operations are managed within each NIKE Brand geographic operating segment. Converse is also a reportable segment for the Company, and\noperates in one industry: the design, marketing, licensing and selling of casual sneakers, apparel and accessories.\nGlobal Brand Divisions is included within the NIKE Brand for presentation purposes to align with the way management views the Company.

Other Information\nOn July 20, 2018, the Compensation Committee (the “Committee”) of the Board of Directors of NIKE, Inc. (the “Company”), approved a form of discretionary performance\naward agreement (the “DPA”) to enable the Company to award cash incentives to employees in recognition of Company and individual performance. The form of DPA is\nintended to enhance the Company’s ability to pay for performance on a case-by-case basis by supplementing the Company’s existing performance-based compensation plans,\nincluding the Amended and Restated Long-Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) and the Executive Performance Sharing Plan. The foregoing is qualified in its entirety by reference to\nthe form of DPA, which is filed as Exhibit 10.22 hereto and incorporated by reference herein.\nAdditionally, on July 20, 2018, the Committee approved awards under the form of DPA to the Company’s continuing named executive officers (collectively, the “Officers”) as\nfollows: Mark G. Parker, $1,295,000; Andrew Campion, $277,500; Eric D. Sprunk, $277,500; Hilary K. Krane, $185,000; and John F. Slusher, $185,000. As further described in\nthe Company’s 2018 Proxy Statement, the Committee adjusted the payouts for LTIP awards covering the fiscal 2016-2018 performance period to primarily account for the\nimpact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Because the terms of the LTIP awards, as applicable to the Company's named executive officers, did not contemplate the Tax Cuts and\nJobs Act, the Committee determined to award these one-time DPA grants so as to put the Officers in the same position as the non-executive officer LTIP participants.\n73\n\n\nTable of Contents\nPART III\nITEM 10.

During EMPLOYEE’s employment at NIKE, under the terms of any employment contract or\notherwise, and for one (1) year thereafter (the \"Restriction Period\"), EMPLOYEE will not directly or indirectly own,\nmanage, control or participate in the ownership, management or control of, or be employed by, consult for or be\nconnected in any manner\n\n\nwith, any business engaged anywhere in the world in the athletic footwear, athletic apparel or sports equipment,\nsports electronics/technology and sports accessories business, or any other business that directly competes with\nNIKE or any of its parent, subsidiaries or affiliated corporations (a \"Competitor\"). This provision is subject to NIKE's\noption to waive all or any portion of the Restriction Period as more specifically provided below.\n(b)\nExtension of Time. In the event EMPLOYEE breaches this covenant not to compete, the Restriction Period shall\nautomatically toll from the date of the first breach, and all subsequent breaches, until the resolution of the breach\nthrough private settlement, judicial or other action, including all appeals. The Restriction Period shall continue upon\nthe effective date of any such settlement, judicial or other resolution. NIKE shall not be obligated to pay EMPLOYEE\nthe additional compensation described in paragraph 1.1 below during any period of time in which this Agreement is\ntolled due to EMPLOYEE's breach. In the event EMPLOYEE receives such additional compensation after any such\nbreach, EMPLOYEE must immediately reimburse NIKE in the amount of all such compensation upon the receipt of a\nwritten request by NIKE.\n(c)\nWaiver of Non-Compete. NIKE has the option, in its sole discretion, to elect to waive all or a portion of the\nRestriction Period or to limit the definition of Competitor by giving EMPLOYEE seven (7) days' prior notice of such\nelection.

Question to answer:\nWe need to calculate a reasonable approximation (or exact number if possible) of a financial metric.

However, the exact figures for each year are not visible in the input provided.\n\n2. **Sufficiency of Information**: To answer the question, we need the total revenue and COGS for each of the three fiscal years. This information is necessary to calculate the COGS as a percentage of revenue for each year and then find the average of these percentages over the three years.\n\n3. **Missing Information**: If the extracted data does not include the revenue and COGS figures for each fiscal year, we are missing critical information. We need these figures to perform the calculations.\n\n4. **Calculation Method**: If we have the revenue and COGS for each year, we would calculate the COGS as a percentage of revenue for each year using the formula: \\((\\text{COGS} / \\text{Revenue}) \\times 100\\). Then, we would average these percentages over the three years to get the final answer.\n\n5. **Conflicting Answers**: If there are conflicting figures for revenue or COGS, we would need to refer to the citations provided in the job outputs to determine the most reliable data source.\n\nIn summary, we need to ensure that we have the specific revenue and COGS figures for FY2016, FY2017, and FY2018.

The loss of the services of key individuals, or\nany negative  perception  with respect  to these  individuals,  could  harm our business.  Our  success  also depends  on our  ability  to recruit,  retain  and  engage  our personnel\nsufficiently, both to maintain our current business and to execute our strategic initiatives. Competition for employees in our industry is intense and we may not be successful in\nattracting and retaining such personnel.

If, on June 30, 2018, all of these shares were converted into Class B\nCommon Stock, the commensurate ownership percentage of our Class B Common Stock would be approximately 17%. The shares are available for resale, subject to the\nrequirements of the U.S. securities laws and the terms of the limited liability company agreement governing Swoosh, LLC. The sale or prospect of a sale of a substantial\nnumber of these shares could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. Swoosh, LLC was formed by Philip H.

Unit sales of apparel increased 4% and higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 5 percentage points of apparel revenue growth, primarily due to\nhigher ASPs from full-price, off-price and NIKE Direct sales.\nFor fiscal 2018, NIKE Direct revenues represented approximately 30% of our total NIKE Brand revenues compared to 28% for fiscal 2017. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE\nDirect revenues increased 12% for fiscal 2018, driven by strong digital commerce sales growth of 25%, the addition of new stores and 4% comparable store sales growth.\nComparable store sales include revenues from NIKE-owned in-line and factory stores for which all three of the following requirements have been met: (1) the store has been\nopen at least one year, (2) square footage has not changed by more than 15% within the past year and (3) the store has not been permanently repositioned within the past\nyear.

Demand creation was flat as higher sports marketing and retail\nbrand presentation costs offset lower marketing and advertising costs.\n27\n\n\nTable of Contents\nEurope, Middle East & Africa\n(Dollars in millions)\nFiscal 2018\nFiscal 2017\n% Change\n% Change\nExcluding\nCurrency\nChanges\nFiscal 2016\n% Change\n% Change\nExcluding\nCurrency\nChanges\nRevenues by:\n \nFootwear\n$\n5,875\n$\n5,192\n13%\n6%\n$\n5,043\n3 %\n8%\nApparel\n2,940\n2,395\n23%\n16%\n2,149\n11 %\n17%\nEquipment\n427\n383\n11%\n6%\n376\n2 %\n7%\nTOTAL REVENUES\n$\n9,242\n$\n7,970\n16%\n9%\n$\n7,568\n5 %\n10%\nRevenues by:\n \n \n \nSales to Wholesale Customers\n$\n6,765\n$\n5,917\n14%\n8%\n$\n5,869\n1 %\n5%\nSales through NIKE Direct\n2,477\n2,053\n21%\n13%\n1,699\n21 %\n27%\nTOTAL REVENUES\n$\n9,242\n$\n7,970\n16%\n9%\n$\n7,568\n5 %\n10%\nEARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST\nAND TAXES\n$\n1,587\n$\n1,507\n5%\n$\n1,787\n-16 %\n \nFiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017\nOn a currency-neutral basis, EMEA revenues for fiscal 2018 increased 9%, driven by higher revenues in every territory, most notably our UK & Ireland territory, which grew\n21%.

The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the products to NIKE entities in their respective functional\ncurrencies. NTC sales to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency result in a foreign currency exposure for the NTC.\nb.\nOther NIKE entities purchase product directly from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those\nNIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar.\nIn both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U.S. Dollar decreases inventory costs incurred by NIKE whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar increases its cost.\n2.\nFactory input costs: NIKE operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign\ncurrency risk by assuming certain of the factories’ foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures.\nUnder this program, our payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies (“factory currency exposure index”) in which the\nlabor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products (“factory input costs”) are denominated.\nFor the currency within the factory currency exposure indices that is the local or functional currency of the factory, the currency rate fluctuation affecting the",

The increase in Cash used by financing activities\nwas also impacted by increased repurchases of common stock, which resulted in a cash outflow of $4,254 million for fiscal 2018 compared to an outflow of $3,223 million for\nfiscal 2017 .\nIn fiscal 2018 , we purchased 69.7 million shares of NIKE’s Class B Common Stock for $4,267 million (an average price of $ 61.25 per share) under the four-year, $12 billion\nprogram approved by the Board of Directors in November 2015. As of May 31, 2018, we had repurchased 149.4 million shares at a cost of $8,704 million (an average price of\n$58.25 per share) under this program. Although the timing and number of shares purchased will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions, we currently\nanticipate completing this program during fiscal 2019. In June 2018, our Board of Directors approved a new four-year, $15 billion program to repurchase shares of NIKE’s\nClass B Common Stock, which we anticipate will commence at the completion of our current program. We continue to expect funding of share repurchases will come from\noperating cash flows, excess cash and/or proceeds from debt.\n34\n\n\nTable of Contents\nCapital Resources\nOn July 21, 2016, we filed a shelf registration statement (the “Shelf”) with the SEC which permits us to issue an unlimited amount of debt securities from time to time.

Our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of\ninterest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we maintain a mix of commercial paper, bank loans, and\nfixed-rate debt of varying maturities.\nMarket Risk Measurement\nWe monitor foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value, sensitivity analysis and Value-at-\nRisk (“VaR”). Our market-sensitive derivative and other financial instruments are foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts, interest rate swaps,\nintercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies, fixed interest rate U.S. Dollar denominated debt and fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt.\nWe use VaR to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only. The VaR determines the maximum\npotential one-day loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate-sensitive financial instruments. The VaR model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95%\nconfidence level. There are various modeling techniques that can be used in the VaR computation. Our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and\ninterest rates (a “variance/co-variance” technique). These interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the\npreceding one-year period.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those\npolicies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of\nthe  company;  (ii)  provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded  as  necessary  to  permit  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  generally\naccepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the\ncompany; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could\nhave a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to\nfuture periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures\nmay deteriorate.\n/S/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nPortland, Oregon\nJuly 24, 2018\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1974.  \n43\n\n\nTable of Contents\nNIKE, Inc.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, as a result of further analysis of the provisions of the Tax Act and additional guidance, this provisional\ntax expense decreased by $135 million . The transition tax is based on the Company’s estimated total post-1986 undistributed foreign earnings at a tax rate of 15.5% for\nforeign cash and certain other specified assets, and 8% on the remaining earnings. The Company expects to pay the transition tax in installments over an eight -year period.\nAccordingly, the non-current portion of the provisional expense for the transition tax of $1,078 million , net of applicable foreign tax credits the Company expects to utilize, has\nbeen recorded in Deferred income taxes and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nImpact of Changes in the Tax Rate\nAs a result of the reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, the Company remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are\nexpected to be realized.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, as a result of further analysis of the provisions of the Tax Act and additional guidance, this provisional\ntax expense decreased by $135 million . The transition tax is based on the Company’s estimated total post-1986 undistributed foreign earnings at a tax rate of 15.5% for\nforeign cash and certain other specified assets, and 8% on the remaining earnings. The Company expects to pay the transition tax in installments over an eight -year period.\nAccordingly, the non-current portion of the provisional expense for the transition tax of $1,078 million , net of applicable foreign tax credits the Company expects to utilize, has\nbeen recorded in Deferred income taxes and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nImpact of Changes in the Tax Rate\nAs a result of the reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, the Company remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are\nexpected to be realized. The total provisional expense recorded during the period for the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities was $158 million .\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities comprise the following:  \n \nAs of May 31,\n(In millions)\n2018\n2017\nDeferred tax assets:\n \nInventories\n$\n73\n$\n90\nSales return reserves\n104\n130\nDeferred compensation\n250\n348\nStock-based compensation\n135\n225\nReserves and accrued liabilities\n102\n88\nNet operating loss carry-forwards\n88\n84\nForeign tax credit carry-forwards\n—\n208\nUndistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries\n—\n173\nOther\n106\n106\nTotal deferred tax assets\n858\n1,452\nValuation allowance\n(95)\n(82)\nTotal deferred tax assets after valuation allowance\n763\n1,370\nDeferred tax liabilities:\n \nForeign withholding tax on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries\n(155)\n—\nProperty, plant and equipment\n(167)\n(254)\nIntangibles\n(77)\n(90)\nOther\n(26)\n(2)\nTotal deferred tax liabilities\n(425)\n(346)\nNET DEFERRED TAX ASSET\n$\n338\n$\n1,024\nThe following is a reconciliation of the changes in the gross balance of unrecognized tax benefits:\n \nAs of May 31,\n(In millions)\n2018\n2017\n2016\nUnrecognized tax benefits, beginning of the period\n$\n461\n$\n506\n$\n438\nGross increases related to prior period tax positions\n19\n31\n49\nGross decreases related to prior period tax positions\n(12)\n(163)\n(20)\nGross increases related to current period tax positions\n249\n115\n81\nSettlements\n—\n(12)\n(13)\nLapse of statute of limitations\n(20)\n(21)\n(17)\nChanges due to currency translation\n1\n5\n(12)\nUNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS, END OF THE PERIOD\n$\n698\n$\n461\n$\n506\nAs of May 31, 2018 , total gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding related interest and penalties, were $698 million , $478 million of which would affect the Company’s\neffec",

Embedded  derivative  contracts  are  treated  as  foreign  currency  forward  contracts  that  are  bifurcated  from  the  related\npurchase order and recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with their corresponding change in fair value recognized in \nOther expense (income), net , through the date the foreign currency fluctuations cease to exist.\nAt May 31, 2018 , the total notional amount of all embedded derivatives outstanding was approximately $260 million .\nCredit Risk\nThe Company is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to hedging instruments. The counterparties to all derivative transactions are\nmajor financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings; however, this does not eliminate the Company’s exposure to credit risk with these institutions. This credit risk is\nlimited to the unrealized gains in such contracts should any of these counterparties fail to perform as contracted. To manage this risk, the Company has established strict\ncounterparty credit guidelines that are continually monitored.\nThe Company’s derivative contracts contain credit risk-related contingent features designed to protect against significant deterioration in counterparties’ creditworthiness and\ntheir ultimate ability to settle outstanding derivative contracts in the normal course of business.

The foregoing is qualified in its entirety by reference to\nthe form of DPA, which is filed as Exhibit 10.22 hereto and incorporated by reference herein.\nAdditionally, on July 20, 2018, the Committee approved awards under the form of DPA to the Company’s continuing named executive officers (collectively, the “Officers”) as\nfollows: Mark G.

We have both the total revenue and COGS figures for FY2016, FY2017, and FY2018.\n\n3. **Calculation**:\n   - To find the COGS as a percentage of revenue for each year, use the formula:\n     \\[\n     \\text{COGS \\% of Revenue} = \\left(\\frac{\\text{COGS}}{\\text{Revenue}}\\right) \\times 100\n     \\]\n   - Calculations:\n     - FY2016: \\(\\left(\\frac{17,405}{32,376}\\right) \\times 100 \\approx 53.8\\%\\)\n     - FY2017: \\(\\left(\\frac{19,038}{34,350}\\right) \\times 100 \\approx 55.4\\%\\)\n     - FY2018: \\(\\left(\\frac{20,441}{36,397}\\right) \\times 100 \\approx 56.2\\%\\)\n\n4. **Three-Year Average**:\n   - Calculate the average of the percentages:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Average COGS \\%} = \\frac{53.8 + 55.4 + 56.2}{3} \\approx 55.1\\%\n     \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The three-year average of COGS as a percentage of revenue for Nike from FY2016 to FY2018 is approximately 55.1\\%. This calculation is based on the extracted data, which is consistent across the relevant chunks."
