However, based on available financial data, the operating margin for FY2022 is estimated to be approximately 34.7%. The document does not contain explicit commentary on the usefulness of operating margin as a metric for Adobe, but it is implied to be relevant in certain contexts.",

  "correctness_reasoning": "The predicted answer does not match the ground truth answer in terms of the yes/no stance. The ground truth states that Adobe's operating margin declined, while the predicted answer does not explicitly confirm this decline. Additionally, the predicted operating margin of 34.7% is within the 10% tolerance of the ground truth's 34.6%, but the key conclusion about the decline is missing."
