  "question": "Does Boeing have an improving gross margin profile as of FY2022? If gross margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then state that and explain why.",
  "predicted_answer": "Boeing's gross margin profile shows an improvement from FY2020 to FY2021, but a slight decline from FY2021 to FY2022. The gross margin figures are approximately 94.5% for FY2022, 95.3% for FY2021, and 78.0% for FY2020. However, the relevance of gross margin as a metric for Boeing is debated due to the impact of abnormal costs and accounting adjustments.",
  "ground_truth": [
    "Yes. Boeing has an improving gross margin profile as of FY2022. Gross profit improved from $3,017 million in FY2021 to $3,502 million in FY2022. Gross margin % improved from 4.8% in FY2021 to 5.3% in FY2022."

  "correctness_reasoning": "The predicted answer incorrectly states that Boeing's gross margin declined from FY2021 to FY2022, whereas the ground truth indicates an improvement. The numerical values provided in the predicted answer are also significantly different from the ground truth, exceeding the 10% tolerance. Additionally, the predicted answer questions the relevance of gross margin as a metric, which is not addressed in the ground truth."
