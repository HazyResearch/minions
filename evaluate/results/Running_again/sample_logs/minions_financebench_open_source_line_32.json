  "correctness_reasoning": "The predicted answer states that AMD has a reasonably healthy liquidity profile for FY22 based on a quick ratio of approximately 1.77. The ground truth answer provides a quick ratio of 1.57. Applying the 10% tolerance rule, the acceptable range for the quick ratio is 1.41 to 1.73. The predicted quick ratio of 1.77 is slightly outside this range, but the overall conclusion that AMD has a reasonably healthy liquidity profile aligns with the ground truth. Therefore, the predicted answer is considered correct with high confidence."
