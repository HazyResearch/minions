  "question": "Does AMD have a reasonably healthy liquidity profile based on its quick ratio for FY22? If the quick ratio is not relevant to measure liquidity, please state that and explain why.",
  "predicted_answer": "Based on the available information, AMD appears to have a reasonably healthy liquidity position due to its substantial cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. However, due to incomplete data, a precise quick ratio cannot be calculated to definitively assess its liquidity profile for FY22.",
  "ground_truth": [
    "Yes. The quick ratio is 1.57, calculated as (cash and cash equivalents+Short term investments+Accounts receivable, net+receivables from related parties)/ (current liabilities)."
