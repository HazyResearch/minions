--- Question ---
Does AMD have a reasonably healthy liquidity profile based on its quick ratio for FY22? If the quick ratio is not relevant to measure liquidity, please state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
The information is insufficient to determine if AMD has a reasonably healthy liquidity profile based on its quick ratio for FY22. The quick ratio calculation requires accurate figures for current assets, inventory, and current liabilities, but the current liabilities data is inconsistent.

--- Ground Truth ---
['Yes. The quick ratio is 1.57, calculated as (cash and cash equivalents+Short term investments+Accounts receivable, net+receivables from related parties)/ (current liabilities).']
