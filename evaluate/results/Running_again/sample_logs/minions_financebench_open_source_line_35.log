--- Question ---
What drove operating margin change as of the FY22 for AMD? If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then please state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
AMD's operating margin in FY22 was primarily affected by increased costs from the Xilinx acquisition, higher operating expenses, and a decrease in gross margin due to increased COGS.

--- Ground Truth ---
["The decrease in AMD's operating income was primarily driven by amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition"]

--- Correctness Evaluation ---
Is correct: True
Confidence: 0.90
Reasoning: The predicted answer correctly identifies the impact of the Xilinx acquisition on AMD's operating margin, which aligns with the ground truth. It also provides additional context about increased operating expenses and COGS, which are reasonable factors that could affect operating margin. The key fact about the Xilinx acquisition is present, so the answer is considered correct.
