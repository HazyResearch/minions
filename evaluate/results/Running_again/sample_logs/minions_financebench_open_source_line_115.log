--- Question ---
We need to calculate a reasonable approximation (or exact number if possible) of a financial metric. Basing your judgment by information plainly provided in the statement of income, what is Nike's three year average of cost of goods sold as a % of revenue from FY2016 to FY2018? Answer in units of percents and round to one decimal place.

--- Predicted Answer ---
The three-year average COGS as a percentage of revenue is approximately 53.3%.

--- Ground Truth ---
['55.1%']

--- Correctness Evaluation ---
Is correct: False
Confidence: 0.90
Reasoning: The predicted answer of 53.3% is outside the 10% tolerance range of the ground truth answer, which is 55.1%. The acceptable range would be 49.6% to 60.6%.
