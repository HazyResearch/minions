--- Question ---
Roughly how many times has AES Corporation sold its inventory in FY2022? Calculate inventory turnover ratio for the FY2022; if conventional inventory management is not meaningful for the company then state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
The inventory turnover ratio for AES Corporation in FY2022 cannot be calculated due to the absence of average inventory data. The COGS is $10,069 million, but the average inventory is not available. AES Corporation may not use conventional inventory management due to its business model.

--- Ground Truth ---
['AES has converted inventory 9.5 times in FY 2022.']

--- Correctness Evaluation ---
Is correct: False
Confidence: 0.80
Reasoning: The predicted answer states that the inventory turnover ratio cannot be calculated due to the absence of average inventory data, which contradicts the ground truth answer that provides a specific turnover ratio of 9.5 times. The predicted answer also suggests that conventional inventory management may not be meaningful for AES Corporation, but it does not provide a definitive conclusion or explanation as required by the question.
