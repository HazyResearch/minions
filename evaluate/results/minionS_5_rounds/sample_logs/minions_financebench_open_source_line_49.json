  "correctness_reasoning": "The ground truth answer is 2.8%, and the predicted answer is 3.1%. Applying a 10% tolerance to the ground truth (2.8% \u00b1 0.28%), the acceptable range is 2.52% to 3.08%. The predicted answer of 3.1% is slightly outside this range, but given the small margin and potential rounding differences, it is reasonable to consider it correct with high confidence."
