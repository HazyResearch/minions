--- Question ---
Has AMCOR's quick ratio improved or declined between FY2023 and FY2022? If the quick ratio is not something that a financial analyst would ask about a company like this, then state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
Due to the lack of specific financial data, it is not possible to determine whether AMCOR's quick ratio has improved or declined between FY2023 and FY2022. The document does not provide the necessary figures for current assets, inventories, and current liabilities for these fiscal years.

--- Ground Truth ---
['The quick ratio has slightly improved from 0.67 times to 0.69 times between FY 2023 and FY 2022.(3.4% jump)']
