--- Question ---
What drove operating margin change as of the FY22 for AMD? If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then please state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
AMD's operating margin in FY22 was primarily affected by increased costs from the Xilinx acquisition, higher operating expenses, and a decrease in gross margin due to increased COGS.

--- Ground Truth ---
["The decrease in AMD's operating income was primarily driven by amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition"]
