--- Question ---
Does Boeing have an improving gross margin profile as of FY2022? If gross margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
The document does not provide explicit gross margin figures for Boeing for FY2022. However, it suggests that gross margin might not be a useful metric due to the complexities of Boeing's operations, such as fixed-price contracts and development programs. Alternative metrics like operating margins, reach-forward losses, and cash flows are considered more relevant for evaluating Boeing's financial performance.

--- Ground Truth ---
['Yes. Boeing has an improving gross margin profile as of FY2022. Gross profit improved from $3,017 million in FY2021 to $3,502 million in FY2022. Gross margin % improved from 4.8% in FY2021 to 5.3% in FY2022.']

--- Correctness Evaluation ---
Is correct: False
Confidence: 0.80
Reasoning: The predicted answer does not match the ground truth answer. The ground truth states that Boeing has an improving gross margin profile as of FY2022, with specific figures provided. The predicted answer suggests that gross margin might not be a useful metric for Boeing and does not confirm the improvement, which contradicts the ground truth.
