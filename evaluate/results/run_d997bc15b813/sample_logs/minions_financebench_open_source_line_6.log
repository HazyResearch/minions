--- Question ---
Does 3M have a reasonably healthy liquidity profile based on its quick ratio for Q2 of FY2023? If the quick ratio is not relevant to measure liquidity, please state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
Due to inconsistent data on current assets excluding inventory and missing data on current liabilities, we cannot determine if 3M has a reasonably healthy liquidity profile based on its quick ratio for Q2 FY2023.

--- Ground Truth ---
["No. The quick ratio for 3M was 0.96 by Jun'23 close, which needs a bit of an improvement to touch the 1x mark"]

--- Correctness Evaluation ---
Is correct: False
Confidence: 0.90
Reasoning: The predicted answer states that the quick ratio cannot be determined due to inconsistent data, while the ground truth provides a specific quick ratio value of 0.96. The stance on whether 3M has a healthy liquidity profile does not match, as the ground truth concludes 'No' based on the quick ratio, while the predicted answer does not provide a definitive stance. Therefore, the predicted answer does not align with the ground truth.
