--- Question ---
Roughly how many times has AES Corporation sold its inventory in FY2022? Calculate inventory turnover ratio for the FY2022; if conventional inventory management is not meaningful for the company then state that and explain why.

Conventional inventory management is not applicable to AES Corporation, and the inventory turnover ratio cannot be calculated due to the absence of a financial average inventory value.

--- Ground Truth ---
['AES has converted inventory 9.5 times in FY 2022.']
