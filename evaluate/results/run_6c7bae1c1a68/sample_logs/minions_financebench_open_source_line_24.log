--- Question ---
Has AMCOR's quick ratio improved or declined between FY2023 and FY2022? If the quick ratio is not something that a financial analyst would ask about a company like this, then state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
The quick ratio for AMCOR cannot be accurately determined due to missing and inconsistent data on marketable securities for both FY2023 and FY2022. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude whether the quick ratio has improved or declined between these fiscal years.

--- Ground Truth ---
['The quick ratio has slightly improved from 0.67 times to 0.69 times between FY 2023 and FY 2022.(3.4% jump)']
