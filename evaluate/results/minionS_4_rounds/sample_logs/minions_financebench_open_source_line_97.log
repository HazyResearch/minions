--- Question ---
Are JPM's gross margins historically consistent (not fluctuating more than roughly 2% each year)? If gross margins are not a relevant metric for a company like this, then please state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
Gross margins are not a relevant metric for JPMorgan Chase due to the nature of banking operations.

--- Ground Truth ---
['Since JPM is a financial institution, gross margin is not a relevant metric.']

--- Correctness Evaluation ---
Is correct: True
Confidence: 1.00
Reasoning: The predicted answer correctly states that gross margins are not a relevant metric for JPMorgan Chase, aligning with the ground truth answer. Both answers recognize the nature of banking operations as the reason for this irrelevance.
