Total length: 376493 characters.: \n\n## Question\nDoes Adobe have an improving operating margin profile as of FY2022? If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then state that and explain why.\n\n---\n\nPlease provide succinct advice on the critical information we need to extract from the Financial document. Total length: 376493 characters to answer this question. \n\nAlso consider the following constraints:\n- In your response do NOT use numbered lists.\n- Do NOT structure your response as a sequence of steps.\n",
      "output": "To determine if Adobe has an improving operating margin profile as of FY2022, focus on extracting key financial metrics related to operating margin from the document. Look for Adobe's operating income and revenue figures for FY2022 and compare them to previous fiscal years to identify any trends or improvements. Pay attention to any commentary or analysis provided in the document that discusses changes in operating expenses, revenue growth, or cost management strategies, as these can impact the operating margin. If the document includes management's discussion and analysis (MD&A) or financial highlights, these sections often provide insights into the company's financial performance and strategic initiatives that could affect the operating margin.\n\nIf operating margin is not a useful metric for Adobe, consider the nature of its business model. For a software company like Adobe, other metrics such as recurring revenue growth, customer acquisition costs, or subscription renewal rates might be more indicative of financial health and performance. The document might discuss these alternative metrics in the context of Adobe's strategic focus on cloud services and subscription-based revenue models. Understanding the relevance of operating margin in the context of Adobe's business strategy and industry standards will help determine its usefulness as a performance indicator."

      "prompt": "# Decomposition Round #1\n\nYou (the supervisor) cannot directly read the document(s). Instead, you can assign small, isolated tasks to a less capable worker model that sees only a single chunk of text at a time. Any cross-chunk or multi-document reasoning must be handled by you.\n\n## Your Job: Write Two Python Functions\n\n### FUNCTION #1: `prepare_jobs(context, prev_job_manifests, prev_job_outputs) -> List[JobManifest]`\n- Break the document(s) into chunks (using the provided chunking function, if needed). Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 12 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`. All **multi-chunk integration** or **global reasoning** is your responsibility here.\n- Return one **aggregated string** suitable for further supervisor inspection.\n\n\n\n## Relevant Pydantic Models\n\nThe following models are already in the global scope. **Do NOT redefine or re-import them.**\n\n### JobManifest Model\n```\nclass JobManifest(BaseModel):\n    chunk: str  # the actual text for the chunk of the document\n    task: str  # the actual task instruction for the small model\n    advice: str  # optional, any additional advice on how to perform the task\n\n    chunk_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    task_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    job_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n\n```\n\n### JobOutput Model\n```\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    citation: Optional[str]\n    answer: Optional[str]\n\n```\n\n## Function Signatures\n```\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        context (List[str]): A list of documents.

Any of these factors could create downward pressure on pricing and gross margins \nand could adversely affect our renewal and upsell and cross-sell rates, as well as our ability to attract new customers. \nOur future success will depend on our continued ability to enhance and integrate our existing products and services, \nintroduce new products and services in a timely and cost-effective manner, meet changing customer expectations and needs, \nextend our core technology into new applications, and anticipate emerging standards, business models, software delivery \nmethods and other technological developments. For example, consumers continue to migrate from personal computers to tablet \nand mobile devices and from desktop to the web. While we offer our products on a variety of platforms, if we cannot continue \nadapting our products to tablet and mobile devices or the web, or if our competitors can adapt their products more quickly than \nus, our business could be harmed. In addition, releases of new devices or operating systems may make it more difficult for our \nproducts to perform or may require significant cost to adapt our solutions. The potential costs and delays incurred as a result \ncould harm our business. If we fail to anticipate or misjudge customers’ rapidly changing needs and expectations or adapt to \nemerging technological trends, our market share and results of operations could suffer.\nFurthermore, some of our competitors and potential competitors enjoy competitive advantages, such as greater financial, \ntechnical, sales, marketing and other resources, broader brand awareness and access to larger customer bases. As a result of \nthese advantages, potential and current customers might select the products and services of our competitors, causing a loss of \nour market share. Our competitors, including large enterprises, may develop products, features or services that are similar to \nours or that achieve greater acceptance, may undertake more far-reaching and successful product development efforts or \nmarketing campaigns, or may adopt more aggressive pricing policies.\nFor additional information regarding our competition and the risks arising out of the competitive environment in which \nwe operate, see the section title",

For \nadditional information regarding new standards that may have significant impact to our consolidated financial statements, see \nthe section titled “Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Effective” in Note 1 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial \nStatements.\nSuch changes in accounting principles may have an adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of \noperations, or cause an adverse deviation from our revenue and profitability targets, which may negatively impact our financial \nresults. \nChanges in tax rules and regulations or interpretations thereof may adversely affect our effective tax rates.\nWe are a United States-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple domestic and foreign tax jurisdictions. \nSignificant judgment is required in determining our current provision for income taxes and deferred tax assets or liabilities.

In the current global tax policy environment, any changes in laws, regulations and interpretations could \nadversely affect our effective tax rates, cause us to respond by making changes to our business structure, or result in other costs \nto us which could adversely affect our operations and financial results.\nMoreover, we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by domestic and foreign tax authorities.

Since our customers have no \nobligation to renew their subscriptions for our services after the expiration of their initial subscription period, which typically \nranges from 1 to 36 months, our customers may not renew their subscriptions at the same or a higher level of service, for the \nsame number of seats or for the same duration of time",

If our customers do not renew their subscriptions or if they renew on terms \nless favorable to us, our revenue may decline.\nWe generally recognize revenue from our subscription offerings ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements. \nAs a result, most of the subscription revenue we report in each quarter is the result of subscription agreements entered into \nduring previous quarters. Any reduction in new or renewed subscriptions in a quarter may not be reflected in our revenue \nresults until a later quarter and may decrease our revenue in future quarters. Lower sales, reduced demand for our products and \nservices and increases in our attrition rate may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. Our \nsubscription model could also make it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue from subscription-based or hosted services \nthrough additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers will be recognized over the applicable subscription term. \nAdditionally, in connection with our sales efforts to enterprise customers, a number of factors could affect our revenue, \nincluding longer-than-expected sales and implementation cycles, potential deferral of revenue and alternative licensing \narrangements.

We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on \nhistorical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could \ndiffer materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We evaluate our assumptions, judgments and \nestimates on a regular basis. We also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the \nBoard of Directors.\nWe believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition, business \ncombinations and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. These areas are \nkey components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules requiring us to make judgments and estimates, and \nconsequently, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Historically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates \nrelative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results.\nRevenue Recognition \nOur contracts with customers may include multiple goods and services. For example, some of our offerings include both \non-premise and/or on-device software licenses and cloud services. Determining whether the software licenses and the cloud \nservices are distinct from each other, and therefore performance obligations to be accounted for separately, or not distinct from \neach other, and therefore part of a single performance obligation, may require significant judgment. We have concluded that the \non-premise/on-device software licenses and cloud services provided in our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud subscription \nofferings are not distinct from each other such that revenue from each offering should be recognized ratably over the \nsubscription period for which the cloud services ",

The estimated fair value of these obligations is determined utilizing a cost build-up approach. The cost \nbuild-up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin. \nUnanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, \nestimates or actual results.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is \nrecognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are \nrecognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of \nassets and liabilities, and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Significant judgment is required in determining our \ncurrent provision for income taxes and deferred tax assets or liabilities. We record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax \nassets to an amount for which realization is more likely than not.\nOur assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account our \ninterpretation and application of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future examinations conducted by \ndomestic and foreign tax authorities. We have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving \ntax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these \nexaminations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and associated reserves. To the extent that the final \ndetermination of any of these examinations is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for \nincome taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination is made.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements \nSee Note 1 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding recent accounting \npronouncements that are of significance, or potential significance to us. \nACQUISITIONS \nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we completed the acquisition of Frame.io, a privately held company that provides a \ncloud-based video collaboration platform, for approximately $1.24 billion and we began integrating Frame.io into our Digital \nMedia reportable segment.

We expect Creative Cloud will drive sustained \nlong-term revenue growth through a continued expansion of our customer base by attracting new users with new features and \nproducts like Adobe Express that make creative tools accessible to first-time creators and communicators, and delivering new \nfeatures and technologies to existing customers with our latest releases such as share for review.

These strategies include increasing the value Creative Cloud users receive, such \nas offering new desktop, web and mobile applications, as well as targeted promotions and offers that attract past customers and \npotential users to experience and ultimately subscribe to Creative Cloud.

If the total unrecognized tax benefits as of December 2, 2022, \nDecember 3, 2021 and November 27, 2020 were recognized, $203 million, $199 million and $136 million would decrease the \nrespective effective tax rates.\nAs of December 2, 2022 and December 3, 2021, the combined amounts of accrued interest and penalties related to tax \npositions taken on our tax returns were approximately $17 million and $22 million, respectively. These amounts were included \nin long-term income taxes payable in their respective years.\nThe timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax \npayments that are part of any audit settlement process. These events could cause large fluctuations in the balance sheet \nclassification of our tax assets and liabilities. We believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either \ncertain audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. Although \nthe timing of resolution, settlement and closing of audits is not certain, it is reasonably possible that the underlying \nunrecognized tax benefits may decrease by up to $25 million over the next 12 months.\nOur future effective tax rates may be materially affected by changes in the tax rates in jurisdictions where our income is \nearned, changes in jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed, changes in the valuation of our \ndeferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in or interpretation of tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do \nbusiness, or unexpected changes in business and market conditions that could reduce certain tax benefits.\nIn addition, the United States and other countries and jurisdictions in which we conduct business, including those \ncovered by governing bodies that enact tax laws applicable to us, such as the European Commission of the European Union, \ncould make changes to relevant tax, accounting or other laws and interpretations thereof that have a material impact to us. \nThese countries, governmental bodies and intergovernmental economic organizations such as the Organization for Economic \nCooperation and Development, have or could make unprecedented assertions about how taxation is determined and, in some \ncases, have proposed or enacted new laws that are contrary to the way in which rules and regulations have historically been \ninterpreted and applied.

This sensitivity \nanalysis measures the hypothetical market value resulting from a 10% shift in the value of exchange rates relative to the U.S. \nDollar. For option contracts, the Black-Scholes option pricing model was used. A 10% increase in the value of the U.S. Dollar \nand a corresponding decrease in the value of the hedged foreign currency asset would lead to an increase in the fair value of our \nfinancial hedging instruments by $75 million. A 10% decrease in the value of the U.S. Dollar would lead to an increase in the \nfair value of these financial instruments by $17 million.\nAs a general rule, we do not use foreign exchange contracts to hedge local currency denominated operating expenses in \ncountries where a natural hedge exists. For example, in many countries, revenue in the local currencies substantially offsets the \nlocal currency denominated operating expenses. We also have long-term investment exposures consisting of the capitalization \nand retained earnings in our non-U.S. Dollar functional currency foreign subsidiaries. As of December 2, 2022 and \nDecember 3, 2021, this long-term investment exposure totaled an absolute notional equivalent of $770 million and $749 \nmillion, respectively. At this time, we do not hedge these long-term investment exposures.\nWe do not use foreign exchange contracts for speculative trading purposes, nor do we hedge our foreign currency \nexposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates. We regularly review our hedging \nprogram and assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis.\nCash Flow Hedges of Forecasted Foreign Currency Revenue and Expenses\nWe may use foreign exchange purchased options or forward contracts to hedge foreign currency revenue denominated in \nEuros, British Pounds, Japanese Yen and Australian Dollars, or foreign currency expenses in Indian Rupees. We hedge these \ncash flow exposures to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. \nThese foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, have maturities of up to twelve months. We enter into these foreign \nexchange contracts to hedge forecasted revenue and expenses in the normal course of business and accordingly, they are not \nspeculative in nature.\nWe record changes in fair value of these cash flow hedges of foreign currency denominated revenue and expenses in \naccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, until the forecasted transaction occurs.",

In the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur, or it becomes probable that \nit will not occur, we reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income \n(loss) to revenue or operating expenses, as applicable. For the fiscal year ended December 2, 2022, there were no net gains or \nlosses recognized in revenue or operating expenses relating to hedges of forecasted transactions that did not occur.\nNon-Designated Hedges of Foreign Currency Assets and Liabilities\nOur derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist of foreign currency forward contracts that we primarily \nuse to hedge monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies to reduce the risk that our earnings and \ncash flows will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts are \ncarried at fair value with changes in fair value of these contracts recorded to other income (expense), net in our Consolidated \nStatements of Income. These contracts reduce the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. At \nDecember 2, 2022, the outstanding balance sheet hedging derivatives had maturities of 180 days or less.\nSee Note 6 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our derivative financial \ninstruments.\nInterest Rate Risk\nShort-Term Investments and Fixed Income Securities\nAt December 2, 2022, we had debt securities classified as short-term investments of $1.86 billion. Changes in interest \nrates could adversely affect the market value of these investments. A sensitivity analysis was performed on our short-term \ninvestment portfolio as of December 2, 2022, based on an estimate of the hypothetical changes in market value of the portfolio \nthat would result from an immediate parallel shift in the yield curve. A 150 basis point increase in interest rates would lead to a \n$20 million decrease in the market value of our short-term investments. Conversely, a 150 basis point decrease in interest rates \nwould lead to a $20 million increase in the market value of our short-term investments.\nSenior Notes\nAs of December 2, 2022, we had $4.15 billion of senior notes outstanding which bear interest at fixed rates, and \ntherefore do not subject us to financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates. As of December 2, 2022, the \ntotal carrying amount of our senior notes was $4.13 billion and the related fair value based on observable market prices in less \nactive markets was $3.88 billion.\nSee Note 17 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our senior notes.\nTable of Contents\n51\n\n\nITEM 8.

Timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing \nto customers. Certain performance obligations may require payment before delivery of the license or service to the customer. \nIncluded in trade receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are unbilled receivable balances which have not yet been \ninvoiced, and are typically related to license revenue or services which are delivered prior to invoicing. As of December 2, \n2022, the balance of trade receivables, net of allowances for doubtful accounts, was $2.07 billion, inclusive of unbilled \nreceivables of $93 million. As of December 3, 2021, the balance of trade receivables, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, \nwas $1.88 billion, inclusive of unbilled receivables of $82 million.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts which reflects our best estimate of potentially uncollectible trade \nreceivables and is based on both specific and general reserves. We maintain general reserves on a collective basis by \nconsidering factors such as historical experience, credit-worthiness, the age of the trade receivable balances, current economic \nconditions and a reasonable and supportable forecast of future economic conditions. The allowance for doubtful accounts was \n$23 million and $16 million as of December 2, 2022 and December 3, 2021, respectively.\nContract Assets\nA contract asset is recognized when a conditional right to consideration exists and transfer of control has \noccurred.

Contract assets are typically related to subscription and hosted service contracts where the transaction price allocated \nto the satisfied performance obligations exceeds the value of billings to date. Contract assets are included in prepaid expenses \nand other current assets for the current portion and other assets for the long-term portion on the Consolidated Balance \nSheets. We regularly review contract asset balances for impairment, considering factors such as historical experience, credit-\nworthiness, age of the balance, current economic conditions and a reasonable and supportable forecast of future economic \nconditions. Contract asset impairments were not material in fiscal 2022 and 2021. Contract assets were $97 million and $85 \nmillion as of December 2, 2022 and December 3, 2021, respectively.\nDeferred Revenue and Remaining Performance Obligations\nDeferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from \nsubscription services, including non-cancellable and non-refundable committed funds and refundable customer deposits. \nDeferred revenue is recognized as revenue when transfer of control to customers has occurred. Customers are typically invoiced \nfor these agreements in regular installments and revenue is recognized ratably over the contractual subscription period. The \ndeferred revenue balance is influenced by several factors, including the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, \ninvoice timing, size and new business linearity within the quarter. Deferred revenue does not represent the total contract value \nof annual or multi-year non-cancellable subscription agreements. \nPayment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within \n30 to 60 days. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined \nour contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to \nprovide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services, such as invoicing at the \nbeginning of a subscription term with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, and not to receive financing from our \ncustomers. Any potential financing fees are considered insignificant in the context of our contracts.\nAs of December 2, 2022, the balance of deferred revenue was $5.41 billion, which includes $99 million of refundable \ncustomer deposits. Refundable customer deposits represent arrangements in which the customer has a unilateral cancellation \nright for which we are obligated to refund amounts paid related to products or services not yet delivered or provided at the time \nof cancellation on a prorated basis. Arrangements with some of our enterprise customers with non-cancellable and non-\nrefundable committed funds provide options to either renew monthly on-premise term-based licenses or use some or a",

Significant movements in the deferred \nrevenue balance during the period consisted of increases due to payments received prior to transfer of control of the underlying \nperformance obligations to the customer and deferred revenue assumed through acquisition, which were offset by decreases due \nto revenue recognized in the period. During the year ended December 2, 2022, approximately $4.72 billion of revenue was \nrecognized that was included in the balance of deferred revenue as of December 3, 2021.\nTransaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations represents contracted revenue that has not yet been \nrecognized, which includes deferred revenue and unbilled amounts that will be recognized as revenue in future periods. \nTransaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations is influenced by several factors, including the timing of \nrenewals and average contract term. We applied practical expedients to exclude amounts related to performance obligations that \nare billed and recognized as they are delivered, optional purchases that do not represent material rights, sales- and usage-based \nroyalties not yet consumed and any estimated amounts of variable consideration that are subject to constraint. \nRemaining performance obligations were approximately $15.19 billion as of December 2, 2022. Non-cancellable and \nnon-refundable committed funds related to some of our enterprise customer agreements referred to in the paragraph above \ncomprised approximately 5% of the total remaining performance obligations. Approximately 72% of the remaining \nperformance obligations, excluding the aforementioned enterprise customer agreements, are expected to be recognized over the \nnext 12 months with the remainder recognized thereafter.\nContract Acquisition Costs\nWe recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefit of those \ncosts to be longer than one year. We have determined that certain sales incentive programs meet the requirements to be \ncapitalized. \nThe costs capitalized are primarily sales commissions paid to our sales force personnel. Capitalized costs may also \ninclude portions of fringe benefits and payroll taxes associated with compensation for incremental costs to acquire customer \ncontracts and incentive payments to partners.\nCapitalized costs to obtain a contract are amortized over the expected period of benefit, which we have determined, \nbased on analysis, to be 5 years.

The ECC approves the terms of each of our Performance Share Programs, including the award \ncalculation methodology.\nIn January 2022, the ECC approved the 2022 Performance Share Program. Shares outstanding under our 2022 \nPerformance Share Program may be earned based on the achievement of (i) an objective relative total stockholder return \nmeasured over a three-year performance period, as well as (ii) revenue-based financial metrics measured over three one-year \nperformance periods. Each type of performance goal is weighted 50% and achievement of each performance goal is determined \nindependently of the other. Shares associated with each performance goal are not awarded until the corresponding performance \ntargets are defined.\nShares outstanding under our 2021 and 2020 Performance Share Programs may be earned based on the achievement of \nan objective relative total stockholder return measured over a three-year performance period. \nPerformance share awards in each of our 2022, 2021 and 2020 Performance Share Programs will be earned and cliff-vest \nupon the later of (i) the three-year anniversary of the earliest vesting commencement date in the respective Performance Share \nProgram, or (ii) the ECC's certification of the level of achievement of the final performance period in the respective \nPerformance Share Program, contingent upon the participant’s continued service. Participants can earn between 0% and 200% \nof the target number of performance shares.\nAs of December 2, 2022, the shares awarded under our 2022, 2021 and 2020 Performance Share Programs remained \noutstanding and were yet to be earned.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nOur Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) allows eligible employee participants to purchase shares of our common \nstock at a discount through payroll deductions. The ESPP consists of twenty-four-month offering periods with four six-month \npurchase periods in each offering period.

If treasury stock is not available, common stock will be issued. In order to minimize the impact of on-going \ndilution from issuance of shares, we instituted a stock repurchase program. See Note 14 for information regarding our stock \nrepurchase programs.\nValuation of Stock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award. \nOur restricted stock units are valued based on the fair market value of the award on the grant date. Our performance \nshare awards which are contingent upon achievement of relative total stockholder return are valued using a Monte Carlo \nSimulation model. Our performance share awards which are contingent upon achievement of revenue-based financial metrics \nare valued based on the fair market value of the award on the grant date.\n We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of ESPP purchase rights. The determination \nof the grant date fair value of our ESPP purchase rights is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a \nnumber of complex and subjective variables. These variables include our expected stock price volatility over the expected term \nof the awards, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, a risk-free interest rate and any expected \ndividends.\nSummary of Restricted Stock Units\nRestricted stock unit activity for fiscal 2022 was as follows:\nNumber of\nShares\n(in millions)\nWeighted Average\nGrant Date \nFair Value\nAggregate\nFair Value(1)\n(in millions)\nWeighted Average\nRemaining \nContractual Life\n(years)\nBeginning outstanding balance\n \n6.6 $ \n411.52 \nAwarded\n \n4.5 $ \n457.96 \nReleased\n \n(3.0) $ \n381.22 \nForfeited\n \n(0.7) $ \n441.41 \nEnding outstanding balance\n \n7.4 $ \n449.94 $ \n2,511 \n1.33\nExpected to vest\n \n6.7 $ \n449.35 $ \n2,287 \n1.26\n_________________________________________\n(1) \nThe aggregate fair value is calculated using the closing stock price as of December 2, 2022 of $341.53.\nThe weighted average grant date fair values of restricted stock units granted during fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 were \n$457.96, $504.69 and $358.68, respectively.

The related discount and issuance costs are amortized to interest expense over \nthe respective terms of the notes using the effective interest method. Interest is payable semi-annually, in arrears on February 1 \nand August 1.\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we reclassified the senior notes due February 1, 2023 as current debt in our \nConsolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 2, 2022, the carrying value of our current debt was $500 million, net of the \nrelated discount and issuance costs. We intend to repay the current portion of our debt on or before the due date.\nOur senior notes rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. We may redeem the notes at \nany time, subject to a make-whole premium. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain change of control triggering events, we \nmay be required to repurchase the notes, at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to \nthe date of repurchase. The notes do not contain financial covenants but include covenants that limit our ability to grant liens on \nassets and to enter into sale and leaseback transactions, subject to significant allowances.\nRevolving Credit Agreement\nIn June 2022, we entered into a credit agreement (“Revolving Credit Agreement”), providing for a five-year $1.5 billion \nsenior unsecured revolving credit facility, which replaced our previous five-year $1 billion senior unsecured revolving credit \nagreement entered into in October 2018 (the “Prior Revolving Credit Agreement”). The Revolving Credit Agreement provides \nfor loans to Adobe and certain of its subsidiaries that may be designated from time to time as additional borrowers. Pursuant to \nthe terms of the Revolving Credit Agreement, we may, subject to the agreement of lenders to provide additional commitments, \nobtain up to an additional $500 million in commitments, for a maximum aggregate commitment of $2 billion.

Any of these factors could create downward pressure on pricing and gross margins \nand could adversely affect our renewal and upsell and cross-sell rates, as well as our ability to attract new customers. \nOur future success will depend on our continued ability to enhance and integrate our existing products and services, \nintroduce new products and services in a timely and cost-effective manner, meet changing customer expectations and needs, \nextend our core technology into new applications, and anticipate emerging standards, business models, software delivery \nmethods and other technological developments. For example, consumers continue to migrate from personal computers to tablet \nand mobile devices and from desktop to the web. While we offer our products on a variety of platforms, if we cannot continue \nadapting our products to tablet and mobile devices or the web, or if our competitors can adapt their products more quickly than \nus, our business could be harmed. In addition, releases of new devices or operating systems may make it more difficult for our \nproducts to perform or may require significant cost to adapt our solutions. The potential costs and delays incurred as a result \ncould harm our business. If we fail to anticipate or misjudge customers’ rapidly changing needs and expectations or adapt to \nemerging technological trends, our market share and results of operations could suffer.\nFurthermore, some of our competitors and potential competitors enjoy competitive advantages, such as greater financial, \ntechnical, sales, marketing and other resources, broader brand awareness and access to larger customer bases. As a result of \nthese advantages, potential and current customers might select the products and services of our competitors, causing a loss of \nour market share. Our competitors, including large enterprises, may develop products, features or services that are similar to \nours or that achieve greater acceptance, may undertake more far-reaching and successful product development efforts or \nmarketing campaigns, or may adopt more aggressive pricing policies.\nFor additional information regarding our competition and the risks arising out of the competitive environment in which \nwe operate, see the section title",

In the current global tax policy environment, any changes in laws, regulations and interpretations could \nadversely affect our effective tax rates, cause us to respond by making changes to our business structure, or result in other costs \nto us which could adversely affect our operations and financial results.\nMoreover, we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by domestic and foreign tax authorities.

Since our customers have no \nobligation to renew their subscriptions for our services after the expiration of their initial subscription period, which typically \nranges from 1 to 36 months, our customers may not renew their subscriptions at the same or a higher level of service, for the \nsame number of seats or for the same duration of time",

If our customers do not renew their subscriptions or if they renew on terms \nless favorable to us, our revenue may decline.\nWe generally recognize revenue from our subscription offerings ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements. \nAs a result, most of the subscription revenue we report in each quarter is the result of subscription agreements entered into \nduring previous quarters.

Lower sales, reduced demand for our products and \nservices and increases in our attrition rate may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. Our \nsubscription model could also make it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue from subscription-based or hosted services \nthrough additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers will be recognized over the applicable subscription term. \nAdditionally, in connection with our sales efforts to enterprise customers, a number of factors could affect our revenue, \nincluding longer-than-expected sales and implementation cycles, potential deferral of revenue and alternative licensing \narrangements.

We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on \nhistorical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could \ndiffer materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We evaluate our assumptions, judgments and \nestimates on a regular basis. We also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the \nBoard of Directors.\nWe believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition, business \ncombinations and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. These areas are \nkey components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules requiring us to make judgments and estimates, and \nconsequently, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Historically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates \nrelative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results.\nRevenue Recognition \nOur contracts with customers may include multiple goods and services. For example, some of our offerings include both \non-premise and/or on-device software licenses and cloud services. Determining whether the software licenses and the cloud \nservices are distinct from each other, and therefore performance obligations to be accounted for separately, or not distinct from \neach other, and therefore part of a single performance obligation, may require significant judgment. We have concluded that the \non-premise/on-device software licenses and cloud services provided in our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud subscription \nofferings are not distinct from each other such that revenue from each offering should be recognized ratably over the \nsubscription period for which the cloud services ",

The cost \nbuild-up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin. \nUnanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, \nestimates or actual results.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is \nrecognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are \nrecognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of \nassets and liabilities, and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Significant judgment is required in determining our \ncurrent provision for income taxes and deferred tax assets or liabilities. We record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax \nassets to an amount for which realization is more likely than not.\nOur assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account our \ninterpretation and application of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future examinations conducted by \ndomestic and foreign tax authorities. We have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving \ntax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these \nexaminations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and associated reserves. To the extent that the final \ndetermination of any of these examinations is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for \nincome taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination is made.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements \nSee Note 1 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding recent accounting \npronouncements that are of significance, or potential significance to us. \nACQUISITIONS \nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we completed the acquisition of Frame.io, a privately held company that provides a \ncloud-based video collaboration platform, for approximately $1.24 billion and we began integrating Frame.io into our Digital \nMedia reportable segment.

As we execute on our long-term growth initiatives, we have continued to \nexperience growth in software-based subscription revenue across our portfolio of offerings.\nDigital Media\nIn our Digital Media segment, we are a market leader with Creative Cloud, our subscription-based offering which \nprovides desktop tools, mobile apps and cloud-based services for designing, creating and publishing rich content and immersive \n3D experiences. Starting in December 2021, Creative Cloud includes Adobe Express, a web and mobile application designed to \nenable a broad spectrum of users, including novice content creators, communicators and creative professionals, to create, edit \nand customize content quickly and easily with content-first, task-based solutions.

We expect Creative Cloud will drive sustained \nlong-term revenue growth through a continued expansion of our customer base by attracting new users with new features and \nproducts like Adobe Express that make creative tools accessible to first-time creators and communicators, and delivering new \nfeatures and technologies to existing customers with our latest releases such as share for review. We have also built out a \nmarketplace for Creative Cloud subscribers to enable the delivery and purchase of stock content in our Adobe Stock service. \nOverall, our strategy with Creative Cloud is designed to enable us to increase our revenue with users, attract more new \ncustomers, and grow our recurring and predictable revenue stream that is recognized ratably.\nWe continue to implement strategies that are designed to accelerate awareness, consideration and purchase of \nsubscriptions to our Creative Cloud offerings. These strategies include increasing the value Creative Cloud users receive, such \nas offering new desktop, web and mobile applications, as well as targeted promotions and offers that attract past customers and \npotential users to experience and ultimately subscribe to Creative Cloud.

If the total unrecognized tax benefits as of December 2, 2022, \nDecember 3, 2021 and November 27, 2020 were recognized, $203 million, $199 million and $136 million would decrease the \nrespective effective tax rates.\nAs of December 2, 2022 and December 3, 2021, the combined amounts of accrued interest and penalties related to tax \npositions taken on our tax returns were approximately $17 million and $22 million, respectively. These amounts were included \nin long-term income taxes payable in their respective years.\nThe timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax \npayments that are part of any audit settlement process. These events could cause large fluctuations in the balance sheet \nclassification of our tax assets and liabilities. We believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either \ncertain audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. Although \nthe timing of resolution, settlement and closing of audits is not certain, it is reasonably possible that the underlying \nunrecognized tax benefits may decrease by up to $25 million over the next 12 months.\nOur future effective tax rates may be materially affected by changes in the tax rates in jurisdictions where our income is \nearned, changes in jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed, changes in the valuation of our \ndeferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in or interpretation of tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do \nbusiness, or unexpected changes in business and market conditions that could reduce certain tax benefits.\nIn addition, the United States and other countries and jurisdictions in which we conduct business, including those \ncovered by governing bodies that enact tax laws applicable to us, such as the European Commission of the European Union, \ncould make changes to relevant tax, accounting or other laws and interpretations thereof that have a material impact to us. \nThese countries, governmental bodies and intergovernmental economic organizations such as the Organization for Economic \nCooperation and Development, have or could make unprecedented assertions about how taxation is determined and, in some \ncases, have proposed or enacted new laws that are contrary to the way in which rules and regulations have historically been \ninterpreted and applied.

A 10% increase in the value of the U.S. Dollar \nand a corresponding decrease in the value of the hedged foreign currency asset would lead to an increase in the fair value of our \nfinancial hedging instruments by $75 million. A 10% decrease in the value of the U.S. Dollar would lead to an increase in the \nfair value of these financial instruments by $17 million.\nAs a general rule, we do not use foreign exchange contracts to hedge local currency denominated operating expenses in \ncountries where a natural hedge exists. For example, in many countries, revenue in the local currencies substantially offsets the \nlocal currency denominated operating expenses. We also have long-term investment exposures consisting of the capitalization \nand retained earnings in our non-U.S. Dollar functional currency foreign subsidiaries. As of December 2, 2022 and \nDecember 3, 2021, this long-term investment exposure totaled an absolute notional equivalent of $770 million and $749 \nmillion, respectively. At this time, we do not hedge these long-term investment exposures.\nWe do not use foreign exchange contracts for speculative trading purposes, nor do we hedge our foreign currency \nexposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates. We regularly review our hedging \nprogram and assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis.\nCash Flow Hedges of Forecasted Foreign Currency Revenue and Expenses\nWe may use foreign exchange purchased options or forward contracts to hedge foreign currency revenue denominated in \nEuros, British Pounds, Japanese Yen and Australian Dollars, or foreign currency expenses in Indian Rupees. We hedge these \ncash flow exposures to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. \nThese foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, have maturities of up to twelve months. We enter into these foreign \nexchange contracts to hedge forecasted revenue and expenses in the normal course of business and accordingly, they are not \nspeculative in nature.\nWe record changes in fair value of these cash flow hedges of foreign currency denominated revenue and expenses in \naccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, until the forecasted transaction occurs.",

In the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur, or it becomes probable that \nit will not occur, we reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income \n(loss) to revenue or operating expenses, as applicable. For the fiscal year ended December 2, 2022, there were no net gains or \nlosses recognized in revenue or operating expenses relating to hedges of forecasted transactions that did not occur.\nNon-Designated Hedges of Foreign Currency Assets and Liabilities\nOur derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist of foreign currency forward contracts that we primarily \nuse to hedge monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies to reduce the risk that our earnings and \ncash flows will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts are \ncarried at fair value with changes in fair value of these contracts recorded to other income (expense), net in our Consolidated \nStatements of Income. These contracts reduce the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. At \nDecember 2, 2022, the outstanding balance sheet hedging derivatives had maturities of 180 days or less.\nSee Note 6 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our derivative financial \ninstruments.\nInterest Rate Risk\nShort-Term Investments and Fixed Income Securities\nAt December 2, 2022, we had debt securities classified as short-term investments of $1.86 billion. Changes in interest \nrates could adversely affect the market value of these investments. A sensitivity analysis was performed on our short-term \ninvestment portfolio as of December 2, 2022, based on an estimate of the hypothetical changes in market value of the portfolio \nthat would result from an immediate parallel shift in the yield curve. A 150 basis point increase in interest rates would lead to a \n$20 million decrease in the market value of our short-term investments. Conversely, a 150 basis point decrease in interest rates \nwould lead to a $20 million increase in the market value of our short-term investments.\nSenior Notes\nAs of December 2, 2022, we had $4.15 billion of senior notes outstanding which bear interest at fixed rates, and \ntherefore do not subject us to financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates. As of December 2, 2022, the \ntotal carrying amount of our senior notes was $4.13 billion and the related fair value based on observable market prices in less \nactive markets was $3.88 billion.\nSee Note 17 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our senior notes.\nTable of Contents\n51\n\n\nITEM 8.

We have operations \nin the Americas; Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”); and Asia-Pacific (“APAC”).\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include those of Adobe and its subsidiaries, after elimination of \nall intercompany accounts and transactions. We have prepared the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements in \naccordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and pursuant to the rules \nand regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).\nUse of Estimates\nIn preparing Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP and pursuant to the \nrules and regulations of the SEC, we must make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated \nFinancial Statements and accompanying Notes. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, sales allowances and programs, bad \ndebts, stock-based compensation, determining the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities, litigation and income \ntaxes.

Operating leases are recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Right-of-use \n(“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities are measured at the lease commencement date based on the present value of the remaining \nlease payments over the lease term, determined using the discount rate for the lease at the commencement date.

Timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing \nto customers. Certain performance obligations may require payment before delivery of the license or service to the customer. \nIncluded in trade receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are unbilled receivable balances which have not yet been \ninvoiced, and are typically related to license revenue or services which are delivered prior to invoicing. As of December 2, \n2022, the balance of trade receivables, net of allowances for doubtful accounts, was $2.07 billion, inclusive of unbilled \nreceivables of $93 million. As of December 3, 2021, the balance of trade receivables, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, \nwas $1.88 billion, inclusive of unbilled receivables of $82 million.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts which reflects our best estimate of potentially uncollectible trade \nreceivables and is based on both specific and general reserves. We maintain general reserves on a collective basis by \nconsidering factors such as historical experience, credit-worthiness, the age of the trade receivable balances, current economic \nconditions and a reasonable and supportable forecast of future economic conditions. The allowance for doubtful accounts was \n$23 million and $16 million as of December 2, 2022 and December 3, 2021, respectively.\nContract Assets\nA contract asset is recognized when a conditional right to consideration exists and transfer of control has \noccurred.

Contract assets are typically related to subscription and hosted service contracts where the transaction price allocated \nto the satisfied performance obligations exceeds the value of billings to date. Contract assets are included in prepaid expenses \nand other current assets for the current portion and other assets for the long-term portion on the Consolidated Balance \nSheets. We regularly review contract asset balances for impairment, considering factors such as historical experience, credit-\nworthiness, age of the balance, current economic conditions and a reasonable and supportable forecast of future economic \nconditions. Contract asset impairments were not material in fiscal 2022 and 2021. Contract assets were $97 million and $85 \nmillion as of December 2, 2022 and December 3, 2021, respectively.\nDeferred Revenue and Remaining Performance Obligations\nDeferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from \nsubscription services, including non-cancellable and non-refundable committed funds and refundable customer deposits. \nDeferred revenue is recognized as revenue when transfer of control to customers has occurred. Customers are typically invoiced \nfor these agreements in regular installments and revenue is recognized ratably over the contractual subscription period. The \ndeferred revenue balance is influenced by several factors, including the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, \ninvoice timing, size and new business linearity within the quarter. Deferred revenue does not represent the total contract value \nof annual or multi-year non-cancellable subscription agreements. \nPayment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within \n30 to 60 days. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined \nour contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to \nprovide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services, such as invoicing at the \nbeginning of a subscription term with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, and not to receive financing from our \ncustomers. Any potential financing fees are considered insignificant in the context of our contracts.\nAs of December 2, 2022, the balance of deferred revenue was $5.41 billion, which includes $99 million of refundable \ncustomer deposits. Refundable customer deposits represent arrangements in which the customer has a unilateral cancellation \nright for which we are obligated to refund amounts paid related to products or services not yet delivered or provided at the time \nof cancellation on a prorated basis. Arrangements with some of our enterprise customers with non-cancellable and non-\nrefundable committed funds provide options to either renew monthly on-premise term-based licenses or use some or a",

Significant movements in the deferred \nrevenue balance during the period consisted of increases due to payments received prior to transfer of control of the underlying \nperformance obligations to the customer and deferred revenue assumed through acquisition, which were offset by decreases due \nto revenue recognized in the period. During the year ended December 2, 2022, approximately $4.72 billion of revenue was \nrecognized that was included in the balance of deferred revenue as of December 3, 2021.\nTransaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations represents contracted revenue that has not yet been \nrecognized, which includes deferred revenue and unbilled amounts that will be recognized as revenue in future periods. \nTransaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations is influenced by several factors, including the timing of \nrenewals and average contract term. We applied practical expedients to exclude amounts related to performance obligations that \nare billed and recognized as they are delivered, optional purchases that do not represent material rights, sales- and usage-based \nroyalties not yet consumed and any estimated amounts of variable consideration that are subject to constraint. \nRemaining performance obligations were approximately $15.19 billion as of December 2, 2022. Non-cancellable and \nnon-refundable committed funds related to some of our enterprise customer agreements referred to in the paragraph above \ncomprised approximately 5% of the total remaining performance obligations. Approximately 72% of the remaining \nperformance obligations, excluding the aforementioned enterprise customer agreements, are expected to be recognized over the \nnext 12 months with the remainder recognized thereafter.\nContract Acquisition Costs\nWe recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefit of those \ncosts to be longer than one year. We have determined that certain sales incentive programs meet the requirements to be \ncapitalized. \nThe costs capitalized are primarily sales commissions paid to our sales force personnel. Capitalized costs may also \ninclude portions of fringe benefits and payroll taxes associated with compensation for incremental costs to acquire customer \ncontracts and incentive payments to partners.\nCapitalized costs to obtain a contract are amortized over the expected period of benefit, which we have determined, \nbased on analysis, to be 5 years.

The ECC approves the terms of each of our Performance Share Programs, including the award \ncalculation methodology.\nIn January 2022, the ECC approved the 2022 Performance Share Program. Shares outstanding under our 2022 \nPerformance Share Program may be earned based on the achievement of (i) an objective relative total stockholder return \nmeasured over a three-year performance period, as well as (ii) revenue-based financial metrics measured over three one-year \nperformance periods. Each type of performance goal is weighted 50% and achievement of each performance goal is determined \nindependently of the other. Shares associated with each performance goal are not awarded until the corresponding performance \ntargets are defined.\nShares outstanding under our 2021 and 2020 Performance Share Programs may be earned based on the achievement of \nan objective relative total stockholder return measured over a three-year performance period. \nPerformance share awards in each of our 2022, 2021 and 2020 Performance Share Programs will be earned and cliff-vest \nupon the later of (i) the three-year anniversary of the earliest vesting commencement date in the respective Performance Share \nProgram, or (ii) the ECC's certification of the level of achievement of the final performance period in the respective \nPerformance Share Program, contingent upon the participant’s continued service. Participants can earn between 0% and 200% \nof the target number of performance shares.\nAs of December 2, 2022, the shares awarded under our 2022, 2021 and 2020 Performance Share Programs remained \noutstanding and were yet to be earned.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nOur Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) allows eligible employee participants to purchase shares of our common \nstock at a discount through payroll deductions.

If treasury stock is not available, common stock will be issued. In order to minimize the impact of on-going \ndilution from issuance of shares, we instituted a stock repurchase program. See Note 14 for information regarding our stock \nrepurchase programs.\nValuation of Stock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award. \nOur restricted stock units are valued based on the fair market value of the award on the grant date. Our performance \nshare awards which are contingent upon achievement of relative total stockholder return are valued using a Monte Carlo \nSimulation model. Our performance share awards which are contingent upon achievement of revenue-based financial metrics \nare valued based on the fair market value of the award on the grant date.\n We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of ESPP purchase rights. The determination \nof the grant date fair value of our ESPP purchase rights is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a \nnumber of complex and subjective variables. These variables include our expected stock price volatility over the expected term \nof the awards, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, a risk-free interest rate and any expected \ndividends.\nSummary of Restricted Stock Units\nRestricted stock unit activity for fiscal 2022 was as follows:\nNumber of\nShares\n(in millions)\nWeighted Average\nGrant Date \nFair Value\nAggregate\nFair Value(1)\n(in millions)\nWeighted Average\nRemaining \nContractual Life\n(years)\nBeginning outstanding balance\n \n6.6 $ \n411.52 \nAwarded\n \n4.5 $ \n457.96 \nReleased\n \n(3.0) $ \n381.22 \nForfeited\n \n(0.7) $ \n441.41 \nEnding outstanding balance\n \n7.4 $ \n449.94 $ \n2,511 \n1.33\nExpected to vest\n \n6.7 $ \n449.35 $ \n2,287 \n1.26\n_________________________________________\n(1) \nThe aggregate fair value is calculated using the closing stock price as of December 2, 2022 of $341.53.\nThe weighted average grant date fair values of restricted stock units granted during fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 were \n$457.96, $504.69 and $358.68, respectively.

The related discount and issuance costs are amortized to interest expense over \nthe respective terms of the notes using the effective interest method. Interest is payable semi-annually, in arrears on February 1 \nand August 1.\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we reclassified the senior notes due February 1, 2023 as current debt in our \nConsolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 2, 2022, the carrying value of our current debt was $500 million, net of the \nrelated discount and issuance costs. We intend to repay the current portion of our debt on or before the due date.\nOur senior notes rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. We may redeem the notes at \nany time, subject to a make-whole premium. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain change of control triggering events, we \nmay be required to repurchase the notes, at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to \nthe date of repurchase. The notes do not contain financial covenants but include covenants that limit our ability to grant liens on \nassets and to enter into sale and leaseback transactions, subject to significant allowances.\nRevolving Credit Agreement\nIn June 2022, we entered into a credit agreement (“Revolving Credit Agreement”), providing for a five-year $1.5 billion \nsenior unsecured revolving credit facility, which replaced our previous five-year $1 billion senior unsecured revolving credit \nagreement entered into in October 2018 (the “Prior Revolving Credit Agreement”). The Revolving Credit Agreement provides \nfor loans to Adobe and certain of its subsidiaries that may be designated from time to time as additional borrowers. Pursuant to \nthe terms of the Revolving Credit Agreement, we may, subject to the agreement of lenders to provide additional commitments, \nobtain up to an additional $500 million in commitments, for a maximum aggregate commitment of $2 billion.

Subject to certain conditions \nstated in the Revolving Credit Agreement, Adobe and any of its subsidiaries designated as additional borrowers may borrow, \nprepay and re-borrow amounts at any time during the term of the Revolving Credit Agreement.\nThe Revolving Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, \nincluding events of default and indemnification provisions in favor of the lenders. The negative covenants include restrictions \nregarding the incurrence of liens and indebtedness, certain merger transactions, dispositions and other matters, all subject to \ncertain exceptions. \nThe facility will terminate and all amounts owing thereunder will be due and payable on the maturity date unless (a) the \ncommitments are terminated earlier upon the occurrence of certain events, including an event of default, or (b) the maturity date \nis further extended upon our request, subject to the agreement of the lenders.\nAs of December 2, 2022, there were no outstanding borrowings under this Revolving Credit Agreement.\nIn connection with and at the time that we entered into the Revolving Credit Agreement, the Prior Revolving Credit \nAgreement originally scheduled to expire in October 2023 was terminated.

Any of these factors could create downward pressure on pricing and gross margins \nand could adversely affect our renewal and upsell and cross-sell rates, as well as our ability to attract new customers. \nOur future success will depend on our continued ability to enhance and integrate our existing products and services, \nintroduce new products and services in a timely and cost-effective manner, meet changing customer expectations and needs, \nextend our core technology into new applications, and anticipate emerging standards, business models, software delivery \nmethods and other technological developments. For example, consumers continue to migrate from personal computers to tablet \nand mobile devices and from desktop to the web. While we offer our products on a variety of platforms, if we cannot continue \nadapting our products to tablet and mobile devices or the web, or if our competitors can adapt their products more quickly than \nus, our business could be harmed. In addition, releases of new devices or operating systems may make it more difficult for our \nproducts to perform or may require significant cost to adapt our solutions. The potential costs and delays incurred as a result \ncould harm our business. If we fail to anticipate or misjudge customers’ rapidly changing needs and expectations or adapt to \nemerging technological trends, our market share and results of operations could suffer.\nFurthermore, some of our competitors and potential competitors enjoy competitive advantages, such as greater financial, \ntechnical, sales, marketing and other resources, broader brand awareness and access to larger customer bases. As a result of \nthese advantages, potential and current customers might select the products and services of our competitors, causing a loss of \nour market share. Our competitors, including large enterprises, may develop products, features or services that are similar to \nours or that achieve greater acceptance, may undertake more far-reaching and successful product development efforts or \nmarketing campaigns, or may adopt more aggressive pricing policies.\nFor additional information regarding our competition and the risks arising out of the competitive environment in which \nwe operate, see the section title",

We believe our tax estimates \nto be reasonable; however, we cannot provide assurance that the final determination of any of these examinations will not have \nan adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nContracting with government entities exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government procurement process. \nWe provide products and services, directly and indirectly, to a variety of domestic and foreign government entities, \nwhich introduces certain risks, including extended sales and collection cycles, varying governmental budgeting processes and \nadherence to complex procurement regulations and other government-specific contractual requirements. We have been, are \ncurrently and may in the future be subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts and any violations \ncould result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, payment of \nfines and suspension or debarment from future government business, as well as harm to our reputation and financial results.\nRisks Related to Financial Performance\nIf our customers fail to renew subscriptions in accordance with our expectations, our future revenue and operating results \ncould suffer, and our subscription offerings may create additional risk related to the timing of revenue recognition.\nOur offerings are typically subscription-based, pursuant to product and service agreements. Since our customers have no \nobligation to renew their subscriptions for our services after the expiration of their initial subscription period, which typically \nranges from 1 to 36 months, our customers may not renew their subscriptions at the same or a higher level of service, for the \nsame number of seats or for the same duration of time",

If our customers do not renew their subscriptions or if they renew on terms \nless favorable to us, our revenue may decline.\nWe generally recognize revenue from our subscription offerings ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements. \nAs a result, most of the subscription revenue we report in each quarter is the result of subscription agreements entered into \nduring previous quarters. Any reduction in new or renewed subscriptions in a quarter may not be reflected in our revenue \nresults until a later quarter and may decrease our revenue in future quarters. Lower sales, reduced demand for our products and \nservices and increases in our attrition rate may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. Our \nsubscription model could also make it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue from subscription-based or hosted services \nthrough additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers will be recognized over the applicable subscription term. \nAdditionally, in connection with our sales efforts to enterprise customers, a number of factors could affect our revenue, \nincluding longer-than-expected sales and implementation cycles, potential deferral of revenue and alternative licensing \narrangements. If any of our assumptions about revenue from our subscription-based offerings prove incorrect, our actual results \nmay vary materially from those anticipated.\nWe may incur losses associated with currency fluctuations and may not be able to effectively hedge our exposure.\nOur operating results are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates due to the global scope of our \nbusiness.

We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on \nhistorical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could \ndiffer materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We evaluate our assumptions, judgments and \nestimates on a regular basis. We also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the \nBoard of Directors.\nWe believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition, business \ncombinations and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. These areas are \nkey components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules requiring us to make judgments and estimates, and \nconsequently, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Historically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates \nrelative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results.\nRevenue Recognition \nOur contracts with customers may include multiple goods and services. For example, some of our offerings include both \non-premise and/or on-device software licenses and cloud services. Determining whether the software licenses and the cloud \nservices are distinct from each other, and therefore performance obligations to be accounted for separately, or not distinct from \neach other, and therefore part of a single performance obligation, may require significant judgment. We have concluded that the \non-premise/on-device software licenses and cloud services provided in our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud subscription \nofferings are not distinct from each other such that revenue from each offering should be recognized ratably over the \nsubscription period for which the cloud services ",

Under this method, income tax expense is \nrecognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are \nrecognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of \nassets and liabilities, and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Significant judgment is required in determining our \ncurrent provision for income taxes and deferred tax assets or liabilities. We record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax \nassets to an amount for which realization is more likely than not.\nOur assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account our \ninterpretation and application of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future examinations conducted by \ndomestic and foreign tax authorities. We have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving \ntax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these \nexaminations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and associated reserves.

As we execute on our long-term growth initiatives, we have continued to \nexperience growth in software-based subscription revenue across our portfolio of offerings.\nDigital Media\nIn our Digital Media segment, we are a market leader with Creative Cloud, our subscription-based offering which \nprovides desktop tools, mobile apps and cloud-based services for designing, creating and publishing rich content and immersive \n3D experiences. Starting in December 2021, Creative Cloud includes Adobe Express, a web and mobile application designed to \nenable a broad spectrum of users, including novice content creators, communicators and creative professionals, to create, edit \nand customize content quickly and easily with content-first, task-based solutions.

We expect Creative Cloud will drive sustained \nlong-term revenue growth through a continued expansion of our customer base by attracting new users with new features and \nproducts like Adobe Express that make creative tools accessible to first-time creators and communicators, and delivering new \nfeatures and technologies to existing customers with our latest releases such as share for review. We have also built out a \nmarketplace for Creative Cloud subscribers to enable the delivery and purchase of stock content in our Adobe Stock service. \nOverall, our strategy with Creative Cloud is designed to enable us to increase our revenue with users, attract more new \ncustomers, and grow our recurring and predictable revenue stream that is recognized ratably.\nWe continue to implement strategies that are designed to accelerate awareness, consideration and purchase of \nsubscriptions to our Creative Cloud offerings. These strategies include increasing the value Creative Cloud users receive, such \nas offering new desktop, web and mobile applications, as well as targeted promotions and offers that attract past customers and \npotential users to experience and ultimately subscribe to Creative Cloud. Because of the shift towards Creative Cloud \nsubscriptions and Enterprise Term License Agreements (“ETLAs”), revenue from perpetual licensing of our Creative products \nhas been immaterial to our business.\nWe are also a market leader with our Docume",

Document Cloud, which enhances the way people manage \ncritical documents at home, in the office and across devices, includes Adobe Acrobat, Adobe Acrobat Sign and Adobe Scan. \nAdobe Acrobat is offered both through subscription and perpetual licenses.\nAs part of our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud strategies, we utilize a data-driven operating model (“DDOM”) and \nour Adobe Experience Cloud solutions to raise awareness of our products, drive new customer acquisition, engagement and \nretention, and optimize customer journeys, and it continues to contribute strong growth in the business.\nAnnualized Recurring Revenue (“ARR”) is currently the key performance metric our management uses to assess the \nhealth and trajectory of our overall Digital Media segment.

We adjust our reported ARR on an annual basis to reflect any exchange rate changes.

While we continued to provide Digital Media services in Ukraine, we \nalso reduced our Digital Media ARR balance by an additional $12 million, which represented our Digital Media business in \nUkraine.

If the total unrecognized tax benefits as of December 2, 2022, \nDecember 3, 2021 and November 27, 2020 were recognized, $203 million, $199 million and $136 million would decrease the \nrespective effective tax rates.\nAs of December 2, 2022 and December 3, 2021, the combined amounts of accrued interest and penalties related to tax \npositions taken on our tax returns were approximately $17 million and $22 million, respectively. These amounts were included \nin long-term income taxes payable in their respective years.\nThe timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax \npayments that are part of any audit settlement process. These events could cause large fluctuations in the balance sheet \nclassification of our tax assets and liabilities. We believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either \ncertain audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. Although \nthe timing of resolution, settlement and closing of audits is not certain, it is reasonably possible that the underlying \nunrecognized tax benefits may decrease by up to $25 million over the next 12 months.\nOur future effective tax rates may be materially affected by changes in the tax rates in jurisdictions where our income is \nearned, changes in jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed, changes in the valuation of our \ndeferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in or interpretation of tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do \nbusiness, or unexpected changes in business and market conditions that could reduce certain tax benefits.\nIn addition, the United States and other countries and jurisdictions in which we conduct business, including those \ncovered by governing bodies that enact tax laws applicable to us, such as the European Commission of the European Union, \ncould make changes to relevant tax, accounting or other laws and interpretations thereof that have a material impact to us. \nThese countries, governmental bodies and intergovernmental economic organizations such as the Organization for Economic \nCooperation and Development, have or could make unprecedented assertions about how taxation is determined and, in some \ncases, have proposed or enacted new laws that are contrary to the way in which rules and regulations have historically been \ninterpreted and applied.

Changes in interest \nrates could adversely affect the market value of these investments. A sensitivity analysis was performed on our short-term \ninvestment portfolio as of December 2, 2022, based on an estimate of the hypothetical changes in market value of the portfolio \nthat would result from an immediate parallel shift in the yield curve. A 150 basis point increase in interest rates would lead to a \n$20 million decrease in the market value of our short-term investments. Conversely, a 150 basis point decrease in interest rates \nwould lead to a $20 million increase in the market value of our short-term investments.\nSenior Notes\nAs of December 2, 2022, we had $4.15 billion of senior notes outstanding which bear interest at fixed rates, and \ntherefore do not subject us to financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates. As of December 2, 2022, the \ntotal carrying amount of our senior notes was $4.13 billion and the related fair value based on observable market prices in less \nactive markets was $3.88 billion.\nSee Note 17 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our senior notes.\nTable of Contents\n51\n\n\nITEM 8.

We have operations \nin the Americas; Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”); and Asia-Pacific (“APAC”).\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include those of Adobe and its subsidiaries, after elimination of \nall intercompany accounts and transactions. We have prepared the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements in \naccordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and pursuant to the rules \nand regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).\nUse of Estimates\nIn preparing Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP and pursuant to the \nrules and regulations of the SEC, we must make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated \nFinancial Statements and accompanying Notes. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, sales allowances and programs, bad \ndebts, stock-based compensation, determining the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities, litigation and income \ntaxes. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates.\nFiscal Year\nOur fiscal year is a 52- or 53-week year that ends on the Friday closest to November 30. Our financial results for fiscal \n2021 benefited from an extra week in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 due to our 52/53 week financial calendar whereby fiscal \n2021 was a 53-week year compared with fiscal 2022 and 2020 which were 52-week years.\nReclassifications\nCertain prior year amounts, which are not material, have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation in the \nConsolidated Balance Sheets and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenue is derived from the sale of cloud-enabled software subscriptions, cloud-hosted offerings, term-based, \nroyalty, and perpetual software licenses, associated software maintenance and support plans, consulting services, training and \ntechnical support. Most of our enterprise customer arrangements involve multiple promises to our customers.\nRevenue is recognized when a contract exists between us and a customer and upon transfer of control of promised \nproducts or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those \nproducts or services. We enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which may be \nTable of Contents\nADOBE INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n58\n\n\ncapable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations, or in the case of offerings such as cloud-\nenabled Creative Cloud and Document Cloud, accounted for as a single performance obligation.

Certain revenue arrangements provide customers with unilateral \ncancellation rights, or options to either renew monthly on-premise term-based licenses or use committed funds to purchase \nother Adobe products or services.\nFully hosted subscription services (SaaS) allow customers to access hosted software during the contractual term without \ntaking possession of the software. Cloud-hosted subscription services may be sold on a fee-per-subscription period basis or \nbased on consumption or usage.\nWe recognize revenue ratably over the contractual service term for hosted services that are priced based on a committed \nnumber of transactions where the delivery and consumption of the benefit of the services occur evenly over time, beginning on \nthe date the services associated with the committed transactions are first made available to the customer and continuing through \nthe end of the contractual service term. Over-usage fees and fees based on the actual number of transactions are billed in \naccordance with contract terms as these fees are incurred and are included in the transaction price of an arrangement as variable \nconsideration. Fees based on a number of transactions, where invoicing is aligned to the pattern of performance, customer \nbenefit and consumption, are typically accounted for utilizing the “as-invoiced” practical expedient. Revenue for subscriptions \nsold as a fee per period is recognized ratably over the contractual term as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes \nthe benefit of the underlying service.\nWhen cloud-enabled services are highly integrated and interrelated with on-premise software, such as in our cloud-\nenabled Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings, the individual components are not considered distinct and revenue is \nrecognized ratably over the subscription period for which the cloud-enabled services are provided.\nThe subscription support plans related to those customer arrangements whose revenues we classify as subscription \nrevenues represent stand-ready performance obligations. Revenue from these subscription support plans is recognized ratably \nover their respective contractual terms and classified as subscription revenue.\nLicenses for on-premise software may be purchased on a perpetual basis, as a subscription for a fixed period of time or \nbased on usage for certain of our OEM and royalty agreements.

Contract assets are typically related to subscription and hosted service contracts where the transaction price allocated \nto the satisfied performance obligations exceeds the value of billings to date. Contract assets are included in prepaid expenses \nand other current assets for the current portion and other assets for the long-term portion on the Consolidated Balance \nSheets. We regularly review contract asset balances for impairment, considering factors such as historical experience, credit-\nworthiness, age of the balance, current economic conditions and a reasonable and supportable forecast of future economic \nconditions. Contract asset impairments were not material in fiscal 2022 and 2021. Contract assets were $97 million and $85 \nmillion as of December 2, 2022 and December 3, 2021, respectively.\nDeferred Revenue and Remaining Performance Obligations\nDeferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from \nsubscription services, including non-cancellable and non-refundable committed funds and refundable customer deposits. \nDeferred revenue is recognized as revenue when transfer of control to customers has occurred. Customers are typically invoiced \nfor these agreements in regular installments and revenue is recognized ratably over the contractual subscription period. The \ndeferred revenue balance is influenced by several factors, including the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, \ninvoice timing, size and new business linearity within the quarter. Deferred revenue does not represent the total contract value \nof annual or multi-year non-cancellable subscription agreements. \nPayment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within \n30 to 60 days. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined \nour contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to \nprovide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services, such as invoicing at the \nbeginning of a subscription term with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, and not to receive financing from our \ncustomers. Any potential financing fees are considered insignificant in the context of our contracts.\nAs of December 2, 2022, the balance of deferred revenue was $5.41 billion, which includes $99 million of refundable \ncustomer deposits. Refundable customer deposits represent arrangements in which the customer has a unilateral cancellation \nright for which we are obligated to refund amounts paid related to products or services not yet delivered or provided at the time \nof cancellation on a prorated basis. Arrangements with some of our enterprise customers with non-cancellable and non-\nrefundable committed funds provide options to either renew monthly on-premise term-based licenses or use some or a",

Significant movements in the deferred \nrevenue balance during the period consisted of increases due to payments received prior to transfer of control of the underlying \nperformance obligations to the customer and deferred revenue assumed through acquisition, which were offset by decreases due \nto revenue recognized in the period. During the year ended December 2, 2022, approximately $4.72 billion of revenue was \nrecognized that was included in the balance of deferred revenue as of December 3, 2021.\nTransaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations represents contracted revenue that has not yet been \nrecognized, which includes deferred revenue and unbilled amounts that will be recognized as revenue in future periods. \nTransaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations is influenced by several factors, including the timing of \nrenewals and average contract term. We applied practical expedients to exclude amounts related to performance obligations that \nare billed and recognized as they are delivered, optional purchases that do not represent material rights, sales- and usage-based \nroyalties not yet consumed and any estimated amounts of variable consideration that are subject to constraint. \nRemaining performance obligations were approximately $15.19 billion as of December 2, 2022. Non-cancellable and \nnon-refundable committed funds related to some of our enterprise customer agreements referred to in the paragraph above \ncomprised approximately 5% of the total remaining performance obligations. Approximately 72% of the remaining \nperformance obligations, excluding the aforementioned enterprise customer agreements, are expected to be recognized over the \nnext 12 months with the remainder recognized thereafter.\nContract Acquisition Costs\nWe recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefit of those \ncosts to be longer than one year. We have determined that certain sales incentive programs meet the requirements to be \ncapitalized. \nThe costs capitalized are primarily sales commissions paid to our sales force personnel. Capitalized costs may also \ninclude portions of fringe benefits and payroll taxes associated with compensation for incremental costs to acquire customer \ncontracts and incentive payments to partners.\nCapitalized costs to obtain a contract are amortized over the expected period of benefit, which we have determined, \nbased on analysis, to be 5 years.

We are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by various domestic and foreign tax authorities \nwith 2018 being the earliest fiscal year open for examination in all of our major tax jurisdictions. We regularly assess the \nlikelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have \nreserved for potential adjustments that may result from these examinations. We believe our tax estimates to be reasonable; \nhowever, we cannot provide assurance that the final determination of any of these examinations will not have an adverse effect \non our financial position and results of operations.\nThe timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax \npayments that are part of any audit settlement process. These events could cause large fluctuations in the balance sheet \nclassification of our tax assets and liabilities. We believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either \ncertain audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. Although \nthe timing of resolution, settlement and closing of audits is not certain, it is reasonably possible that the underlying \nunrecognized tax benefits may decrease by up to $25 million over the next 12 months.\nNOTE 11.

Our responsibility is to \nexpress an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over \nfinancial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting \nOversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with \nthe U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the \nPCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the \naudits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, \nwhether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material \nrespects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement \nof the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. \nSuch procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated \nfinancial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by \nmanagement, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal \ncontrol over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the \nrisk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based \non the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the \ncircumstances.

Any of these factors could create downward pressure on pricing and gross margins \nand could adversely affect our renewal and upsell and cross-sell rates, as well as our ability to attract new customers. \nOur future success will depend on our continued ability to enhance and integrate our existing products and services, \nintroduce new products and services in a timely and cost-effective manner, meet changing customer expectations and needs, \nextend our core technology into new applications, and anticipate emerging standards, business models, software delivery \nmethods and other technological developments. For example, consumers continue to migrate from personal computers to tablet \nand mobile devices and from desktop to the web. While we offer our products on a variety of platforms, if we cannot continue \nadapting our products to tablet and mobile devices or the web, or if our competitors can adapt their products more quickly than \nus, our business could be harmed. In addition, releases of new devices or operating systems may make it more difficult for our \nproducts to perform or may require significant cost to adapt our solutions. The potential costs and delays incurred as a result \ncould harm our business. If we fail to anticipate or misjudge customers’ rapidly changing needs and expectations or adapt to \nemerging technological trends, our market share and results of operations could suffer.\nFurthermore, some of our competitors and potential competitors enjoy competitive advantages, such as greater financial, \ntechnical, sales, marketing and other resources, broader brand awareness and access to larger customer bases. As a result of \nthese advantages, potential and current customers might select the products and services of our competitors, causing a loss of \nour market share. Our competitors, including large enterprises, may develop products, features or services that are similar to \nours or that achieve greater acceptance, may undertake more far-reaching and successful product development efforts or \nmarketing campaigns, or may adopt more aggressive pricing policies.\nFor additional information regarding our competition and the risks arising out of the competitive environment in which \nwe operate, see the section title",

We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on \nhistorical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could \ndiffer materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We evaluate our assumptions, judgments and \nestimates on a regular basis. We also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the \nBoard of Directors.\nWe believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition, business \ncombinations and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. These areas are \nkey components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules requiring us to make judgments and estimates, and \nconsequently, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Historically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates \nrelative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results.\nRevenue Recognition \nOur contracts with customers may include multiple goods and services. For example, some of our offerings include both \non-premise and/or on-device software licenses and cloud services. Determining whether the software licenses and the cloud \nservices are distinct from each other, and therefore performance obligations to be accounted for separately, or not distinct from \neach other, and therefore part of a single performance obligation, may require significant judgment. We have concluded that the \non-premise/on-device software licenses and cloud services provided in our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud subscription \nofferings are not distinct from each other such that revenue from each offering should be recognized ratably over the \nsubscription period for which the cloud services ",

The cost \nbuild-up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin. \nUnanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, \nestimates or actual results.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is \nrecognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are \nrecognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of \nassets and liabilities, and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Significant judgment is required in determining our \ncurrent provision for income taxes and deferred tax assets or liabilities. We record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax \nassets to an amount for which realization is more likely than not.\nOur assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account our \ninterpretation and application of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future examinations conducted by \ndomestic and foreign tax authorities. We have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving \ntax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these \nexaminations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and associated reserves. To the extent that the final \ndetermination of any of these examinations is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for \nincome taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination is made.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements \nSee Note 1 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding recent accounting \npronouncements that are of significance, or potential significance to us. \nACQUISITIONS \nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we completed the acquisition of Frame.io, a privately held company that provides a \ncloud-based video collaboration platform, for approximately $1.24 billion and we began integrating Frame.io into our Digital \nMedia reportable segment.

We calculate ARR as follows:\nCreative ARR\nAnnual Value of Creative Cloud Subscriptions and Services\n+ \nAnnual Creative ETLA Contract Value \nDocument Cloud ARR\nAnnual Value of Document Cloud Subscriptions and Services \n+\nAnnual Document Cloud ETLA Contract Value\nDigital Media ARR\nCreative ARR\n+ \nDocument Cloud ARR\nIn March 2022, in response to the Russia-Ukraine war, we announced a halt of all new sales of our products and services \nin Russia and Belarus. As a result, we reduced our Digital Media ARR balance by $75 million, which represented our Digital \nMedia ARR for existing business in Russia and Belarus. While we continued to provide Digital Media services in Ukraine, we \nalso reduced our Digital Media ARR balance by an additional $12 million, which represented our Digital Media business in \nUkraine. This resulted in a total ARR reduction of $87 million taken at the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal 2022.\nCreative ARR exiting fiscal 2022 was $11.60 billion, up from $10.22 billion at the end of fiscal 2021. Document Cloud \nARR exiting fiscal 2022 was $2.37 billion, up from $1.93 billion at the end of fiscal 2021. Total Digital Media ARR grew to \n$13.97 billion at the end of fiscal 2022, up from $12.15 billion at the end of fiscal 2021. Revaluing our ending ARR for fiscal \n2022 using currency rates at the beginning of fiscal 2023, our Digital Media ARR at the end of fiscal 2022 would be $13.26 \nbillion or approximately $712 million lower than the ARR reporte",

If the total unrecognized tax benefits as of December 2, 2022, \nDecember 3, 2021 and November 27, 2020 were recognized, $203 million, $199 million and $136 million would decrease the \nrespective effective tax rates.\nAs of December 2, 2022 and December 3, 2021, the combined amounts of accrued interest and penalties related to tax \npositions taken on our tax returns were approximately $17 million and $22 million, respectively. These amounts were included \nin long-term income taxes payable in their respective years.\nThe timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax \npayments that are part of any audit settlement process. These events could cause large fluctuations in the balance sheet \nclassification of our tax assets and liabilities. We believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either \ncertain audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. Although \nthe timing of resolution, settlement and closing of audits is not certain, it is reasonably possible that the underlying \nunrecognized tax benefits may decrease by up to $25 million over the next 12 months.\nOur future effective tax rates may be materially affected by changes in the tax rates in jurisdictions where our income is \nearned, changes in jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed, changes in the valuation of our \ndeferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in or interpretation of tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do \nbusiness, or unexpected changes in business and market conditions that could reduce certain tax benefits.\nIn addition, the United States and other countries and jurisdictions in which we conduct business, including those \ncovered by governing bodies that enact tax laws applicable to us, such as the European Commission of the European Union, \ncould make changes to relevant tax, accounting or other laws and interpretations thereof that have a material impact to us. \nThese countries, governmental bodies and intergovernmental economic organizations such as the Organization for Economic \nCooperation and Development, have or could make unprecedented assertions about how taxation is determined and, in some \ncases, have proposed or enacted new laws that are contrary to the way in which rules and regulations have historically been \ninterpreted and applied.

For option contracts, the Black-Scholes option pricing model was used.

For example, in many countries, revenue in the local currencies substantially offsets the \nlocal currency denominated operating expenses.

We have operations \nin the Americas; Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”); and Asia-Pacific (“APAC”).\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include those of Adobe and its subsidiaries, after elimination of \nall intercompany accounts and transactions. We have prepared the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements in \naccordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and pursuant to the rules \nand regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).\nUse of Estimates\nIn preparing Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP and pursuant to the \nrules and regulations of the SEC, we must make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated \nFinancial Statements and accompanying Notes. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, sales allowances and programs, bad \ndebts, stock-based compensation, determining the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities, litigation and income \ntaxes. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates.\nFiscal Year\nOur fiscal year is a 52- or 53-week year that ends on the Friday closest to November 30. Our financial results for fiscal \n2021 benefited from an extra week in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 due to our 52/53 week financial calendar whereby fiscal \n2021 was a 53-week year compared with fiscal 2022 and 2020 which were 52-week years.\nReclassifications\nCertain prior year amounts, which are not material, have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation in the \nConsolidated Balance Sheets and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenue is derived from the sale of cloud-enabled software subscriptions, cloud-hosted offerings, term-based, \nroyalty, and perpetual software licenses, associated software maintenance and support plans, consulting services, training and \ntechnical support. Most of our enterprise customer arrangements involve multiple promises to our customers.\nRevenue is recognized when a contract exists between us and a customer and upon transfer of control of promised \nproducts or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those \nproducts or services. We enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which may be \nTable of Contents\nADOBE INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n58\n\n\ncapable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations, or in the case of offerings such as cloud-\nenabled Creative Cloud and Document Cloud, accounted for as a single performance obligation.

Certain revenue arrangements provide customers with unilateral \ncancellation rights, or options to either renew monthly on-premise term-based licenses or use committed funds to purchase \nother Adobe products or services.\nFully hosted subscription services (SaaS) allow customers to access hosted software during the contractual term without \ntaking possession of the software. Cloud-hosted subscription services may be sold on a fee-per-subscription period basis or \nbased on consumption or usage.\nWe recognize revenue ratably over the contractual service term for hosted services that are priced based on a committed \nnumber of transactions where the delivery and consumption of the benefit of the services occur evenly over time, beginning on \nthe date the services associated with the committed transactions are first made available to the customer and continuing through \nthe end of the contractual service term. Over-usage fees and fees based on the actual number of transactions are billed in \naccordance with contract terms as these fees are incurred and are included in the transaction price of an arrangement as variable \nconsideration. Fees based on a number of transactions, where invoicing is aligned to the pattern of performance, customer \nbenefit and consumption, are typically accounted for utilizing the “as-invoiced” practical expedient. Revenue for subscriptions \nsold as a fee per period is recognized ratably over the contractual term as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes \nthe benefit of the underlying service.\nWhen cloud-enabled services are highly integrated and interrelated with on-premise software, such as in our cloud-\nenabled Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings, the individual components are not considered distinct and revenue is \nrecognized ratably over the subscription period for which the cloud-enabled services are provided.\nThe subscription support plans related to those customer arrangements whose revenues we classify as subscription \nrevenues represent stand-ready performance obligations. Revenue from these subscription support plans is recognized ratably \nover their respective contractual terms and classified as subscription revenue.\nLicenses for on-premise software may be purchased on a perpetual basis, as a subscription for a fixed period of time or \nbased on usage for certain of our OEM and royalty agreements.

Revenue from on-premise term license or term licensing arrangements with unilateral cancellation rights \nor monthly renewal options, and any associated maintenance and support, is classified as subscription revenue.\nOur services and other revenue is comprised primarily of fees related to consulting, training, maintenance and support for \ncertain on-premise licenses that are recognized at a point in time and our advertising offerings. We typically sell our consulting \ncontracts on a time-and-materials or fixed-fee basis. These revenues are recognized as the services are performed for time-and-\nmaterials contracts and on a relative performance basis for fixed-fee contracts.

Our transaction-based advertising offerings, where fees are based on a number of impressions per \nmonth and invoicing is aligned to the pattern of performance, customer benefit and consumption, are typically accounted for \nutilizing the “as-invoiced” practical expedient.\nJudgments\nOur contracts with customers may include multiple goods and services.

Individual products may have multiple values for standalone selling price depending on factors such as where they \nare sold and what channel they are sold through. Where standalone selling price may not be directly observable (e.g., the \nperformance obligation is not sold separately), we maximize the use of observable inputs by using information that may include \nreviewing pricing practices, performance obligations with similar customers and selling models.\nCapitalized costs to obtain a contract are amortized over the expected period of benefit, which we have determined, \nbased on analysis, to be 5 years. We evaluated qualitative and quantitative factors to determine the period of amortization, \nincluding contract length, renewals, customer life and the useful lives of our products and acquired products.

Distributors are allowed \nlimited rights of return of products purchased during the previous quarter. In addition, distributors are allowed to return \nproducts that have reached the end of their lives, as defined by us, and for products that are being replaced by new versions. We \noffer rebates to our distributors, resellers and/or end-user customers. Transaction price is reduced for these amounts based on \nactual performance against objectives set forth by us for a particular reporting period, such as volume and timely reporting. \nOn a quarterly basis, the amount of revenue that is reserved is calculated based on our historical trends and data specific \nto each reporting period. The primary method of establishing these reserves is to review historical data from prior periods as a \nTable of Contents\nADOBE INC.\n NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n60\n\n\npercent of revenue to determine a historical reserve rate. We then apply the historical rate to the current period revenue as a \nbasis for estimating future returns.

In the event a customer cancels their contract, \nthey are generally not entitled to a refund for prior services we have provided to them.

In certain of our lease arrangements, \nprimarily those related to our data center arrangements, judgment is required in determining if a contract contains a lease. For \nthese arrangements, there is judgment in evaluating if the arrangement involves an identified asset that is physically distinct or \nwhether we have the right to substantially all of the capacity of an identified asset that is not physically distinct. In \narrangements that involve an identified asset, there is also judgment in evaluating if we have the right to direct the use of that \nasset. \nWe do not have any finance leases. Operating leases are recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Right-of-use \n(“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities are measured at the lease commencement date based on the present value of the remaining \nlease payments over the lease term, determined using the discount rate for the lease at the commencement date. Because the rate \nimplicit in our leases is not readily determinable, we use our incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate, which \napproximates the interest rate at which we could borrow on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments and in \nsimilar economic environments. As of December 2, 2022, our leases had remaining lease terms of up to 9 years, some of which \nincluded options to extend the lease for up to 14 years and options to terminate the lease within 1 year. Optional periods to \nextend the lease, including by not exercising a termination option, are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain \nthat the option will be exercised. We also have one land lease that expires in 2091. Operating lease expense is recognized on a \nstraight-line basis over the lease term. We account for lease and non-lease components, principally common area maintenance \nfor our facilities leases, as a single lease component for our facilities and data center leases. \nIn accordance with accounting requirements, leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are recorded on the balance \nsheet, with lease expense for these leases recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Contract assets were $97 million and $85 \nmillion as of December 2, 2022 and December 3, 2021, respectively.\nDeferred Revenue and Remaining Performance Obligations\nDeferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from \nsubscription services, including non-cancellable and non-refundable committed funds and refundable customer deposits. \nDeferred revenue is recognized as revenue when transfer of control to customers has occurred. Customers are typically invoiced \nfor these agreements in regular installments and revenue is recognized ratably over the contractual subscription period. The \ndeferred revenue balance is influenced by several factors, including the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, \ninvoice timing, size and new business linearity within the quarter. Deferred revenue does not represent the total contract value \nof annual or multi-year non-cancellable subscription agreements. \nPayment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within \n30 to 60 days. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined \nour contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to \nprovide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services, such as invoicing at the \nbeginning of a subscription term with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, and not to receive financing from our \ncustomers. Any potential financing fees are considered insignificant in the context of our contracts.\nAs of December 2, 2022, the balance of deferred revenue was $5.41 billion, which includes $99 million of refundable \ncustomer deposits. Refundable customer deposits represent arrangements in which the customer has a unilateral cancellation \nright for which we are obligated to refund amounts paid related to products or services not yet delivered or provided at the time \nof cancellation on a prorated basis. Arrangements with some of our enterprise customers with non-cancellable and non-\nrefundable committed funds provide options to either renew monthly on-premise term-based licenses or use some or a",

Significant movements in the deferred \nrevenue balance during the period consisted of increases due to payments received prior to transfer of control of the underlying \nperformance obligations to the customer and deferred revenue assumed through acquisition, which were offset by decreases due \nto revenue recognized in the period. During the year ended December 2, 2022, approximately $4.72 billion of revenue was \nrecognized that was included in the balance of deferred revenue as of December 3, 2021.\nTransaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations represents contracted revenue that has not yet been \nrecognized, which includes deferred revenue and unbilled amounts that will be recognized as revenue in future periods. \nTransaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations is influenced by several factors, including the timing of \nrenewals and average contract term. We applied practical expedients to exclude amounts related to performance obligations that \nare billed and recognized as they are delivered, optional purchases that do not represent material rights, sales- and usage-based \nroyalties not yet consumed and any estimated amounts of variable consideration that are subject to constraint. \nRemaining performance obligations were approximately $15.19 billion as of December 2, 2022. Non-cancellable and \nnon-refundable committed funds related to some of our enterprise customer agreements referred to in the paragraph above \ncomprised approximately 5% of the total remaining performance obligations. Approximately 72% of the remaining \nperformance obligations, excluding the aforementioned enterprise customer agreements, are expected to be recognized over the \nnext 12 months with the remainder recognized thereafter.\nContract Acquisition Costs\nWe recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefit of those \ncosts to be longer than one year. We have determined that certain sales incentive programs meet the requirements to be \ncapitalized. \nThe costs capitalized are primarily sales commissions paid to our sales force personnel. Capitalized costs may also \ninclude portions of fringe benefits and payroll taxes associated with compensation for incremental costs to acquire customer \ncontracts and incentive payments to partners.\nCapitalized costs to obtain a contract are amortized over the expected period of benefit, which we have determined, \nbased on analysis, to be 5 years.

We are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by various domestic and foreign tax authorities \nwith 2018 being the earliest fiscal year open for examination in all of our major tax jurisdictions. We regularly assess the \nlikelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have \nreserved for potential adjustments that may result from these examinations. We believe our tax estimates to be reasonable; \nhowever, we cannot provide assurance that the final determination of any of these examinations will not have an adverse effect \non our financial position and results of operations.\nThe timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax \npayments that are part of any audit settlement process. These events could cause large fluctuations in the balance sheet \nclassification of our tax assets and liabilities. We believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either \ncertain audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. Although \nthe timing of resolution, settlement and closing of audits is not certain, it is reasonably possible that the underlying \nunrecognized tax benefits may decrease by up to $25 million over the next 12 months.\nNOTE 11.

Our responsibility is to \nexpress an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over \nfinancial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting \nOversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with \nthe U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the \nPCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the \naudits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, \nwhether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material \nrespects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement \nof the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. \nSuch procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated \nfinancial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by \nmanagement, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal \ncontrol over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the \nrisk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based \non the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the \ncircumstances.

      "output": "We have gathered information on Adobe's operating income and revenue for fiscal years 2020, 2021, and 2022. The operating income for 2022 is reported as \\$6,098 million, with a total revenue of \\$17,606 million. For 2021, the operating income is \\$5,802 million, with a total revenue of \\$15,785 million. For 2020, the operating income is \\$4,237 million, with a total revenue of \\$12,868 million. This allows us to calculate the operating margins for these years as follows:\n\n- 2022: (Operating Income / Total Revenue) * 100 = (6,098 / 17,606) * 100 ≈ 34.7%\n- 2021: (5,802 / 15,785) * 100 ≈ 36.8%\n- 2020: (4,237 / 12,868) * 100 ≈ 32.9%\n\nThe operating margin decreased from 36.8% in 2021 to 34.7% in 2022, indicating a decline rather than an improvement in the operating margin profile for FY2022.\n\nAdditionally, we have information on alternative metrics such as revenue growth, customer acquisition, and recurring revenue, which are relevant for a company like Adobe that focuses on subscription-based models. These metrics might be more indicative of Adobe's financial health and strategic focus than operating margin alone.\n\nThe information is sufficient to answer the question. Adobe does not have an improving operating margin profile as of FY2022, as the margin has decreased compared to the previous year. However, given Adobe's business model, alternative metrics like revenue growth and customer engagement might be more relevant indicators of performance."
