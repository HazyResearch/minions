--- Question ---
Are JPM's gross margins historically consistent (not fluctuating more than roughly 2% each year)? If gross margins are not a relevant metric for a company like this, then please state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
Gross margins are not a relevant metric for JPMorgan Chase. Focus on net interest margin and ROA instead.

--- Ground Truth ---
['Since JPM is a financial institution, gross margin is not a relevant metric.']

--- Correctness Evaluation ---
Is correct: True
Confidence: 1.00
Reasoning: The predicted answer correctly states that gross margins are not a relevant metric for JPMorgan Chase, aligning with the ground truth. It also provides additional context by suggesting more appropriate metrics like net interest margin and ROA, which is acceptable according to the evaluation rules.
