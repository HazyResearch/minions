--- Question ---
Does Adobe have an improving operating margin profile as of FY2022? If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
Adobe's operating margin profile for FY2022 cannot be conclusively determined due to missing explicit data and inconsistent inferred calculations. However, operating margin is generally a useful metric for Adobe, as it provides insight into the company's profitability and efficiency in generating revenue.

--- Ground Truth ---
['No the operating margins of Adobe have recently declined from 36.8% in FY 2021 to 34.6% in FY2022. A drop by 2.2% in a year.']

--- Correctness Evaluation ---
Is correct: False
Confidence: 0.90
Reasoning: The predicted answer does not match the ground truth answer. The ground truth states that Adobe's operating margin declined from 36.8% in FY2021 to 34.6% in FY2022, indicating a worsening margin profile. The predicted answer fails to acknowledge this decline and instead states that the operating margin cannot be conclusively determined, which contradicts the ground truth.
