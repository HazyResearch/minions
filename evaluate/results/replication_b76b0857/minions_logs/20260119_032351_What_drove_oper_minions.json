If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then please state that and explain why.\n\n---\n\nPlease provide succinct advice on the critical information we need to extract from the Financial document. Total length: 413989 characters to answer this question. \n\nAlso consider the following constraints:\n- In your response do NOT use numbered lists.\n- Do NOT structure your response as a sequence of steps.\n",
      "output": "To address the question about what drove the operating margin change for AMD as of FY22, focus on extracting key financial metrics and qualitative insights from the document. Look for sections discussing revenue growth, cost of goods sold, operating expenses, and any significant one-time charges or gains. Pay attention to management's commentary on market conditions, product launches, and competitive pressures, as these can influence operating margins. Additionally, consider any strategic initiatives or changes in business segments that might have impacted profitability. If operating margin is deemed not useful for AMD, it could be due to the company's focus on growth, investment in R&D, or other strategic priorities that prioritize long-term value over short-term profitability. In such cases, alternative metrics like EBITDA or gross margin might provide a better understanding of financial performance."

      "prompt": "# Decomposition Round #1\n\nYou (the supervisor) cannot directly read the document(s). Instead, you can assign small, isolated tasks to a less capable worker model that sees only a single chunk of text at a time. Any cross-chunk or multi-document reasoning must be handled by you.\n\n## Your Job: Write Two Python Functions\n\n### FUNCTION #1: `prepare_jobs(context, prev_job_manifests, prev_job_outputs) -> List[JobManifest]`\n- Break the document(s) into chunks (using the provided chunking function, if needed). Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 12 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`. All **multi-chunk integration** or **global reasoning** is your responsibility here.\n- Return one **aggregated string** suitable for further supervisor inspection.\n\n\n\n## Relevant Pydantic Models\n\nThe following models are already in the global scope. **Do NOT redefine or re-import them.**\n\n### JobManifest Model\n```\nclass JobManifest(BaseModel):\n    chunk: str  # the actual text for the chunk of the document\n    task: str  # the actual task instruction for the small model\n    advice: str  # optional, any additional advice on how to perform the task\n\n    chunk_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    task_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    job_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n\n```\n\n### JobOutput Model\n```\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    citation: Optional[str]\n    answer: Optional[str]\n\n```\n\n## Function Signatures\n```\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        context (List[str]): A list of documents.

These forward-\nlooking statements are based on current expectations and beliefs and involve numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ\nmaterially from expectations. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date hereof or as of the dates indicated in the statements and should not\nbe relied upon as predictions of future events, as we cannot assure you that the events or circumstances reflected in these statements will be achieved or will\noccur. You can identify forward-looking statements by the use of forward-looking terminology including “believes,” “expects,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “seeks,”\n“intends,” “plans,” “pro forma,” “estimates,” “anticipates,” or the negative of these words and phrases, other variations of these words and phrases or\ncomparable terminology. The forward-looking statements relate to, among other things: possible impact of future accounting rules on AMD’s consolidated\nfinancial statements; demand for AMD’s products; the growth, change and competitive landscape of the markets in which AMD participates; international sales\nwill continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future; that AMD’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment balances together\nwith the availability under that certain revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Agreement) made available to AMD and certain of its subsidiaries, our\ncommercial paper program, and our cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund AMD’s operations including capital expenditures and purchase\ncommitments over the next 12 months and beyond; AMD’s ability to obtain sufficient external financing on favorable terms, or at all; AMD’s expectation that\nbased on management’s current knowledge, the potential liability related to AMD’s current litigation will not have a material adverse effect on its financial\nposition, results of operation or cash flows; anticipated ongoing and increased costs related to enhancing and implementing information security controls; all\nunbilled accounts receivables are expected to be billed and collected within 12 months; revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations that are\nunsatisfied which will be recognized in the next 12 months; and a small number of customers will continue to account for a substantial part of AMD’s revenue in\nthe future.

Environmental laws are complex, change frequently and have tended to become\nmore stringent over time. For example, the European Union (EU) and China are two among a growing number of jurisdictions that have enacted restrictions on\nthe use of lead and other materials in electronic products. These regulations affect semiconductor devices and packaging. A number of jurisdictions including\nthe EU, Australia, California and China are developing or have finalized market entry or public procurement regulations for computers and servers based on\nENERGY STAR specifications as well as additional energy consumption limits.\n12\n\n\nTable of Contents\nCertain environmental laws, including the United States Comprehensive, Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or the Superfund\nAct, impose strict or, under certain circumstances, joint and several liability on current and previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal\nor remediation of hazardous substances and impose liability for damages to natural resources. These laws often impose liability even if the owner or operator\ndid not know of, or was not responsible for, the release of such hazardous substances. These environmental laws also assess liability on persons who arrange\nfor hazardous substances to be sent to disposal or treatment facilities when such facilities are found to be contaminated. Such persons can be responsible for\ncleanup costs even if they never owned or operated the contaminated facility.

Since 1981, we have discovered hazardous material releases to the groundwater\nfrom former underground tanks and proceeded to investigate and conduct remediation at these three sites. The chemicals released into the groundwater were\ncommonly used in the semiconductor industry in the United States in the wafer fabrication process prior to 1979.\nIn 1991, we received Final Site Clean-up Requirements Orders from the California Regional Water Quality Control Board relating to the three sites. We have\nentered into settlement agreements with other responsible parties on two of the orders. During the term of such agreements, other parties have agreed to\nassume most of the foreseeable costs as well as the primary role in conducting remediation activities under the orders. We remain responsible for additional\ncosts beyond the scope of the agreements as well as all remaining costs in the event that the other parties do not fulfill their obligations under the settlement\nagreements.\nTo address anticipated future remediation costs under the orders, we have computed and recorded an estimated environmental liability of approximately $3.9\nmillion and have not recorded any potential insurance recoveries in determining the estimated costs of the cleanup.

Intel’s market share, margins and significant financial resources\nenable it to market its products aggressively, to target our customers and our channel partners with special incentives and to influence customers who do\nbusiness with us. These aggressive activities have in the past resulted in lower unit sales and a lower average selling price for many of our products and\nadversely affected our margins and profitability.\nIntel exerts substantial influence over computer manufacturers and their channels of distribution through various brand and other marketing programs. As a\nresult of Intel’s position in the microprocessor market, Intel has been able to control x86 microprocessor and computer system standards and benchmarks and\nto dictate the type of products the microprocessor market requires of us. Intel also dominates the computer system platform, which includes core logic chipsets,\ngraphics chips, networking devices (wired and wireless), non-volatile storage and other components necessary to assemble a computer system. Additionally,\nIntel is able to drive de facto standards and specifications for x86 microprocessors that could cause us and other companies to have delayed access to such\nstandards.\nAs long as Intel remains in this dominant position, we may be materially adversely affected by Intel’s business practices, including rebating and allocation\nstrategies and pricing actions, designed to limit our market share and margins; product mix and introduction schedules; product bundling, marketing and\nmerchandising strategies; exclusivity payments to its current and potential customers, retailers and channel partners; de facto control over industry standards,\nand heavy influence on PC manufacturers and other PC industry participants, including motherboard, memory, chipset and basic input/output system (BIOS)\nsuppliers and software companies as well as the graphics interface for Intel platforms; and marketing and advertising expenditures in support of positioning the\nIntel brand over the brand of its original equipment manufacturer (OEM) customers and retailers.\nIntel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on marketing and research and\ndevelopment than we do.

To the extent Intel manufactures a significantly larger portion of its microprocessor products using more advanced process technologies,\nor introduces competitive new products into the market before we do, we may be more vulnerable to Intel’s aggressive marketing and pricing strategies for\nmicroprocessor products.\nIntel could also take actions that place our discrete graphics processing units (GPUs) at a competitive disadvantage, including giving one or more of our\ncompetitors in the graphics market, such as NVIDIA Corporation, preferential access to its proprietary graphics interface or other useful information or restricting\naccess to external companies. Also, Intel has developed and released their own high-end discrete GPUs, including gaming focused discrete GPUs. We also\ncompete with Intel in field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and Adaptive SoC products. Intel’s position in the microprocessor, and integrated graphics\nchipset markets, its introduction of competitive new products, its existing relationships with top-tier OEMs, and its aggressive marketing and pricing strategies\ncould result in lower unit sales and lower average selling prices for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nGlobal economic and market uncertainty may adversely impact our business and operating results.\nWe experienced a decline in our Client segment revenue as a result of weak PC market macroeconomic conditions and inventory correction actions across the\nPC supply chain in the second half of 2022.

The identification of suitable acquisition or joint venture\ncandidates can be difficult, time-consuming and costly, and we may not be able to successfully complete identified acquisitions or joint ventures.\n31\n\n\nTable of Contents\nFor example, on February 14, 2022, we completed our acquisition of Xilinx and on May 26, 2022, we completed our acquisition of Pensando. While we believe\nthese acquisitions will result in certain benefits, including certain operational synergies and cost efficiencies, and drive product innovations, achieving these\nanticipated benefits will depend on successfully combining our and the acquired companies’ businesses together. It is not certain that the acquired companies\ncan be successfully integrated with our business in a timely manner or at all, or that any of the anticipated benefits will be realized for a variety of reasons,\nincluding, but not limited to: our inability to integrate or benefit from acquired technologies or services in a profitable manner; diversion of capital and other\nresources, including management’s attention from our existing business; unanticipated costs or liabilities associated with the integration; failure to leverage the\nincreased scale of the combined businesses quickly and effectively; coordinating and integrating in countries in which we have not previously operated; the\npotential impact of the acquisitions on our relationships with employees, vendors, suppliers and customers; the impairment of relationships with, or the loss of,\nthe acquired companies’ employees, vendors, suppliers and customers; adverse changes in general economic conditions in regions in which we and the\nacquired companies operate; potential litigation associated with the acquisitions; difficulties in the assimilation of employees and culture; difficulties",

Many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in\nincreased costs, decreases in expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and attention, which could materially impact the combined company. In\naddition, even if the operations of the businesses are integrated successfully, the full benefits of the acquisitions may not be realized within the anticipated time\nframe or at all. All of these factors could decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the acquisitions and negatively impact the combined company. If we\ncannot successfully integrate our and the acquired companies’ businesses and operations, or if there are delays in combining the businesses, it could\nnegatively impact our ability to develop or sell new products and impair our ability to grow our business, which in turn could adversely affect our financial\ncondition and operating results.\nAcquisitions and joint ventures may also involve the entry into geographic or business markets in which we have little or no prior experience. Consequently, we\nmay not achieve anticipated benefits of acquisitions or joint ventures, which could harm our operating results. In addition, to complete an acquisition, we may\nissue equity securities, which would dilute our stockholders’ ownership and could adversely affect the price of our common stock, and/or incur debt, assume\ncontingent liabilities or have amortization expenses and write-downs of acquired assets, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Moreover, if\nsuch acquisitions or joint ventures require us to seek additional debt or equity financing, we may not be able to obtain such financing on terms favorable to us or\nat all. Even if we successfully complete an acquisition or joint venture, we may not be able to assimilate and integrate effectively or efficiently the acquired\nbusiness, technologies, solutions, assets, personnel or operations, particularly if key personnel of the acquired company decide not to work for us.\nAcquisitions and joint ventures may also reduce our cash available for operations and other uses, which could harm our business. Also, any failure on our part\nto effectively evaluate and execute new business initiatives could adversely affect our business. We may not adequately assess the risks of new business\ninitiatives and subsequent events may arise that alter the risks that were initially considered. Furthermore, we may not achieve the objectives and expectations\nwith respect to future operations, products and services.

We record assets acquired, including identifiable intangible\nassets, and liabilities assumed, at their respective fair values at the acquisition date. Any excess of the purchase price over the net fair value of such assets and\nliabilities will be recorded as goodwill. In connection with the Xilinx and Pensando acquisitions, we recorded significant goodwill and other intangible assets on\nour consolidated balance sheet.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are tested for impairment at least annually, and all tangible and intangible assets including goodwill will be\ntested for impairment when certain indicators are present. If, in the future, we determine that tangible or intangible assets, including goodwill, are impaired, we\nwould record an impairment charge at that time. Impairment testing of goodwill requires significant use of judgment and assumptions, particularly as it relates to\nthe determination of fair value. Subsequent to our annual goodwill impairment analysis, we monitor for any events or changes in circumstances, such as\nsignificant adverse changes in business climate or operating results, changes in management’s business strategy, an inability to successfully introduce new\nproducts in the marketplace, an inability to successfully achieve internal forecasts or significant declines in our stock price, which may represent an indicator of\nimpairment. A decrease in the long-term economic outlook and future cash flows of our business could significantly impact asset values and potentially result in\nthe impairment of goodwill and may require us to record future goodwill impairment charges, which may have a material adverse impact on our financial\nposition and results of operations.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources Risks\nThe agreements governing our notes, our guarantees of the Assumed Xilinx Notes, and our Revolving Credit Agr",

In February 2022, we completed our strategic\nacquisition of Xilinx, Inc. (Xilinx) which expanded our technology and product portfolio to include adaptable hardware platforms that enable hardware\nacceleration and rapid innovation across a variety of technologies and established AMD in multiple embedded markets where we have traditionally not had a\nsignificant presence. We now offer Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), Adaptive SoCs, and Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform (ACAP) products.\nWith the acquisition of Xilinx, we have access to a new set of markets and customers, further strengthening and diversifying our business model. In May 2022,\nwe expanded our data center solutions capabilities with the acquisition of Pensando Systems, Inc. (Pensando). We now offer high-performance data\nprocessing units (DPUs) and a software stack that complements our existing products. With the Xilinx and Pensando acquisitions, we are well positioned to\nprovide the industry’s broadest set of leadership compute engines and accelerators to help enable best performance, security, flexibility and total cost of\nownership for leading-edge data centers.\nOur 2022 financial results reflect the strength of our diversified business model despite the challenging PC market conditions in the second half of 2022. Net\nrevenue for 2022 was $23.6 billion, an increase of 44% compared to 2021 net revenue of $16.4 billion. The increase in net revenue was driven by a 64%\nincrease in Data Center segment revenue primarily due to higher sales of our EPYC™ server processors, a 21% increase in Gaming segment revenue\nprimarily due to higher semi-custom product sales, and a significant increase in Embedded segment revenue from the prior year period driven by the inclusion\nof Xilinx embedded product sales. This growth was partially offset by a 10% decrease in Client segment revenue primarily due to lower processor shipments\ndriven by a weak PC market and significant inventory correction actions across the PC supply chain. Gross margin, as a percentage of net revenue for 2022,\nwas 45%, compared to 48% in 2021. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition.\nOperating income for 2022 was $1.3 billion compared to operating income of $3.6 billion for 2021. The decrease in operating income was primarily driven by\namortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition. Net income for 2022 was $1.3 billion compared to $3.2 billion in the prior year. The\ndecrease in net income was primarily driven by lower operating income.\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2022 were $5.9 billion, compared to $3.6 billion at the end of 2021.

The agreement provides for a five-year unsecured revolving credit facility in the aggregate\nprincipal amount of $3.0 billion. There were no funds drawn from this facility during the year ended December 31, 2022. In November 2022, we established a\nnew commercial paper program, under which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum principal amount outstanding at any time of\n$3.0 billion with a maturity of up to 397 days from the date of issue. The commercial paper will be sold at a discount from par or, alternatively, will be sold at par\nand bear interest at rates that will vary based on market conditions at the time of issuance. As of December  31, 2022, we had no commercial paper\noutstanding.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, we returned a total of $3.7 billion to shareholders through the repurchase of 36.3 million shares of\ncommon stock under our stock repurchase program. As of December 31, 2022, $6.5 billion remained available for future stock repurchases under this program.\nThe repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any common stock, has no termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.\nWe continued executing our product technology roadmap by delivering a number of new leadership products and technologies during 2022.

The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make\nestimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis, including\nthose related to our revenue, inventories, business combination, goodwill, long-lived and intangible assets, and income taxes. We base our estimates on\nhistorical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for\nmaking judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Although actual results have historically been reasonably consistent with management’s\nexpectations, the actual results may differ from these estimates or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions.\nManagement believes the following critical accounting estimates are the most significant to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most\ndifficult, subjective and complex judgments.\nRevenue Allowances.  Revenue contracts with our customers include variable amounts which we evaluate under ASC 606-10-32-8 through 14 in order to\ndetermine the net amount of consideration to which we are entitled and which we recognize as revenue. We determine the net amount of consideration to\nwhich we are entitled by estimating the most likely amount of consideration we expect to receive from the customer after adjustments to the contract price for\nrights of return and rebates to our original equipment manufacturers (OEM) customers and rights of return, rebates and price protection on unsold merchandise\nto our distributor customers.\nWe base our determination of necessary adjustments to the contract price by reference to actual historical activity and experience, including actual historical\nreturns, rebates and credits issued to OEM and distributor customers adjusted, as applicable, to include adjustments, if any, for known events or current\neconomic conditions, or both.\nOur estimates of necessary adjustments for distributor price incentives and price protection on unsold products held by distributors are based on actual\nhistorical incentives provided to distributor customers and known future price movements based on our internal and external market data analysis.\nOur estimates of necessary adjustments for OEM price incentives utilize, in addition to known pricing agreements, actual historical rebate attainment rates and\nestimates of future OEM rebate program attainment based on internal and external market data analysis.\nWe offer incent",

Where funds provided for such programs can be estimated, we\nrecognize a reduction to revenue at the time the related revenue is recognized; otherwise, we recognize such reduction to revenue at the later of when: i) the\nrelated revenue transaction occurs; or ii) the program is offered. For transactions where we reimburse a customer for a portion of the customer’s cost to perform\nspecific product advertising or marketing and promotional activities, such amounts are recognized as a reduction to revenue unless they qualify for expense\nrecognition.\nWe also provide limited product return rights to certain OEMs and to most distribution customers. These return rights are generally limited to a contractual\npercentage of the customer’s prior quarter shipments, although, from time to time we may approve additional product returns beyond the contractual\narrangements based on the applicable facts and circumstances. In order to estimate adjustments to revenue to account for these returns, including product\nrestocking rights provided to distributor and OEM customers, we utilize relevant, trended actual historical product return rate information gathered, adjusted for\nactual known information or events, as applicable.\nOverall, our estimates of adjustments to contract price due to variable consideration under our contracts with OEM and distributor customers, based on our\nassumptions and include adjustments, if any, for known events, have been materially consistent with actual results; however, these estimates are subject to\nmanagement’s judgment and actual provisions could be different from our estimates and current provisions, resulting in future adjustments to our revenue and\noperating results.\n42\n\n\nTable of Contents\nInventory Valuation. We value inventory at standard cost, adjusted to approximate the lower of actual cost or estimated net realizable value using assumptions\nabout future demand and market conditions.

In determining excess or obsolescence reserves for products, we consider assumptions such as\nchanges in business and economic conditions, other-than-temporary decreases in demand for our products, and changes in technology or customer\nrequirements. In determining the lower of cost or net realizable value reserves, we consider assumptions such as recent historical sales activity and selling\nprices, as well as estimates of future selling prices. If in any period we anticipate a change in assumptions such as future demand or market conditions to be\nless favorable than our previous estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales, resulting in a negative\nimpact to our gross margin in that period.

Overall, our estimates of inventory carrying value adjustments have been materially consistent with actual results.\nBusiness Combinations. We allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired\nbased on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is\nrecorded as goodwill. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets.\nSignificant estimates in valuing developed technology, in-process research and development, customer relationships and other identifiable intangible assets\ninclude, but are not limited to, expected future revenue growth rates and margins, future changes in technology, time to recreate customer relationships, useful\nlives, and discount rates.\nManagement's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a\nresult, actual results may differ from estimates. Allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable assets and liabilities affects our amortization expense, as\nacquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the useful life, whereas any indefinite lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortized.\nDuring the measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill.

The fair values of our reporting units are estimated using a combination of the income approach, which requires estimating the present value of expected\nfuture cash flows of a reporting unit, and the market approach, which uses financial ratios of comparable companies to arrive at an estimated value for the\nreporting unit. Significant estimates and assumptions used in the income approach include assessments of macroeconomic conditions, growth rates of our\nreporting units in the near- and long-term, expectations of our ability to execute on our roadmap and projections, and the discount rate applied to cash flows.\nSignificant estimates used in the market approach include the identification of comparable companies for each reporting unit, the determination of an\nappropriate control premium that a market participant would apply to a reporting unit, and the determination of appropriate multiples to apply to a reporting unit\nbased on adjustments and consideration of specific attributes of that reporting unit.\n43\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe most significant assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair values of our reporting units are the sales and earnings growth rates\n(including long-term growth rates) and discount rates. Long-term growth rates are dependent on overall market growth rates, the competitive environment and\ninflation. As a result, long-term growth rates could be adversely impacted by a sustained deceleration in category growth or an increased competitive\nenvironment. Discount rates, which are consistent with a weighted average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by a market participant, are based upon\nindustry required rates of return, including consideration of both debt and equity components of the capital structure. Our discount rates may be impacted by\nadverse changes in the macroeconomic environment, prolonged and continuing inflationary pressures, volatility in the equity and debt markets and other factors\nthat otherwise create or exacerbate risks in our reporting units. Changes in operating plans or adverse changes in the business or in the macroeconomic\nenvironment in the future could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair values and could result in a decline in fair value that would trigger future\nimpairment charges of our reporting units’ goodwill. Based on our annual impairment testing, the fair values of all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying\nvalues.\nLong-Lived and Intangible Assets. Long-lived and intangible assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment if indicators of potential impairment exist\nand at least annually for indefinite-lived intangible assets. Impairment indicators are reviewed on a quarterly basis. Assets are grouped and evaluated for\nimpairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. When indi",

In the event such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the recorded value of the assets, the\nassets are written down to their estimated fair values based on the expected discounted future cash flows attributable to the asset group or based on\nappraisals. Factors affecting impairment of assets held for use include the ability of the specific assets to generate separately identifiable positive cash flows.\nWhen assets are removed from operations and held for sale, we estimate impairment losses as the excess of the carrying value of the assets over their fair\nvalue. Market conditions are among the factors affecting impairment of assets held for sale. Changes in any of these factors could necessitate impairment\nrecognition in future periods for assets held for use or assets held for sale.\nIncome Taxes. In determining taxable income for financial statement reporting purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and\njudgments are applied in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets which arise from temporary\ndifferences between the recognition of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement reporting purposes.\nWe regularly assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. Unless recovery is considered more-likely-than-not (a probability level\nof more than 50%), we will record a charge to income tax expense in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not\nultimately be recoverable or maintain the valuation allowance recorded in prior periods. When considering all available evidence, if we determine it is more-\nlikely-than-not we will realize our deferred tax assets, we will reverse some or all of the existing valuation allowance, which would result in a credit to income tax\nexpense and the establishment of an asset in the period of reversal.\nIn determining the need to establish or maintain a valuation allowance, we consider the four sources of jurisdictional taxable income: (i) carryback of net\noperating losses to prior years; (ii) future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences; (iii) viable and prudent tax planning strategies; and (iv) future\ntaxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards.\nThrough the end of 2022, we continue to maintain a valuation allowance of approximately $2.1 billion for certain federal, state, and foreign tax attributes. The\nfederal valuation allowance maintained is due to limitations, under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 or 383, separate return loss year rules, or dual\nconsolidated loss rules. Certain state and foreign valuation allowances are maintained due to a lack of sufficient sources of future taxable income.\nIn addition, the c",

Historically, our net revenue has been generally higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the\nyear, although market conditions and product transitions could impact these trends.\nThe following table provides a summary of net revenue and operating income (loss) by segment for 2022 and 2021:\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2022\nDecember 25,\n2021\n(In millions)\nNet revenue:\nData Center\n$\n6,043 \n$\n3,694 \nClient\n6,201 \n6,887 \nGaming\n6,805 \n5,607 \nEmbedded\n4,552 \n246 \nTotal net revenue\n$\n23,601 \n$\n16,434 \nOperating income (loss):\nData Center\n$\n1,848 \n$\n991 \nClient\n1,190 \n2,088 \nGaming\n953 \n934 \nEmbedded\n2,252 \n44 \nAll Other\n(4,979)\n(409)\nTotal operating income (loss)\n$\n1,264 \n$\n3,648 \nData Center\nData Center net revenue of $6 billion in 2022 increased by 64%, compared to net revenue of $3.7 billion in 2021.

The increase was\nprimarily due to an increase in headcount through acquisitions and organic growth, go-to-market activities, and acquisition-related costs.\nAmortization of Acquisition-Related Intangibles\nIn 2022, cost of sales and operating expense included $1.4 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively, of amortization expense from intangible assets acquired as a\nresult of the acquisitions of Xilinx and Pensando.\nLicensing Gain\nDuring 2022, we recognized $102 million of licensing gain from milestone achievement and royalty income associated with the licensed IP to the THATIC JV,\nour two joint ventures with Higon Information Technology Co., Ltd., a third-party Chinese entity.

The change was primarily due to a $62 million decrease in the\nfair value of equity investments in 2022 compared to an increase in fair value of $56 million from equity investments in 2021, partially offset by $65 million of\ninterest income driven mainly by rising interest rates in 2022 compared to losses from conversion of our convertible debt of $7 million in 2021.\nIncome Tax Provision (Benefit)\nWe recorded an income tax benefit of $122 million in 2022 and an income tax provision of $513 million in 2021, representing effective tax rates of (10%) and\n14%, respectively. The reduction in income tax expense in 2022 was primarily due to the lower pre-tax income coupled with a $261 million foreign-derived\nintangible income tax benefit and $241 million of research and development tax credits.\nThrough the end of fiscal year 2022, we continued to maintain a valuation allowance of approximately $2.1 billion for certain federal, state, and foreign tax\nattributes.

From time to time, the Company may also sell or license portions of its intellectual property (IP) portfolio.\nOn February 14, 2022 (the Xilinx Acquisition Date), the Company completed the acquisition of Xilinx, Inc. (Xilinx). On May 26, 2022 (the Pensando Acquisition\nDate), the Company completed the acquisition of Pensando Systems, Inc. (Pensando). See Note 5 - Business Combinations for additional information on these\nacquisitions.\nNOTE 2 – Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies\nFiscal Year. The Company uses a 52- or 53-week fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in December. Fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 ended on December 31,\n2022, December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020, respectively. Fiscal 2022 consisted of 53 weeks, and fiscal 2021 and 2020 each consisted of 52 weeks.\nPrinciples of Consolidation.  The consolidated financial statements include the Company’s accounts and those of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Upon\nconsolidation, all inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated.\nReclassification. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.\nUse of Estimates. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requires\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of commitments and contingencies at\nthe date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results are likely to differ from\nthose estimates, and such differences may be material to the financial statements. Areas where management uses subjective judgment include, but are not\nlimited to, revenue allowances, inventory valuation, valuation of goodwill and long-lived and intangible assets, and income taxes.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration which the\nCompany expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Sales, value-added, and other taxes collected concurrently with the provision of goods or\nservices are excluded from revenue. Shipping and handling costs associated with product sales are included in cost of sales. Substantially all the Company’s\nrevenue is derived from product sales, representing a single performance obligation.\nCustomers are generally required to pay for products and services within the Company’s standard contractual terms, which are typically net 30 to 60 days. The\nCompany has determined that it does not have significant financing components in its contracts with customers.\nNon-custom products\nThe Company transf",

Non-custom product arrangements generally comprise a single\nperformance obligation. Certain OEMs may be entitled to rights of return and rebates under OEM agreements. The Company also sells to distributors under\nterms allowing the majority of distributors certain rights of return and price protection on unsold merchandise held by them. The Company estimates the amount\nof variable consideration under OEM and distributor arrangements and, accordingly, records a provision for product returns, allowances for price protection and\nrebates based on actual historical experience and any known events.\n57\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe Company offers incentive programs to certain customers, including cooperative advertising, marketing promotions, volume-based incentives and special\npricing arrangements. Where funds provided for such programs can be estimated, the Company recognizes a reduction to revenue at the time the related\nrevenue is recognized; otherwise, the Company recognizes such reduction to revenue at the later of when: i) the related revenue transaction occurs; or ii) the\nprogram is offered. For transactions where the Company reimburses a customer for a portion of the customer’s cost to perform specific product advertising or\nmarketing and promotional activities, such amounts are recognized as a reduction to revenue unless they qualify for expense recognition.\nConstraints of variable consideration have not been material.\nCustom products\nCustom products which are associated with the Company’s Gaming segment (semi-custom products), sold under non-cancellable purchases orders, for which\nthe Company has an enforceable right to payment, and which have no alternative use to the Company at contract inception, are recognized as revenue, over\nthe time of production of the products by the Company. The Company utilizes a cost-based input method, calculated as cost incurred plus estimated margin, to\ndetermine the amount of revenue to recognize for in-process, but incomplete, customer orders at a reporting date. The Company believes that a cost-based\ninput method is the most appropriate manner to measure how the Company satisfies its performance obligations to customers because the effort and costs\nincurred best depict the Company’s satisfaction of its performance obligation.\nSales of semi-custom products are not subject to a right of return. Custom products arrangements generally involve a single performance obligation. There are\nno variable consideration estimates associated with custom products.\nDevelopment and intellectual property licensing agreements\nFrom time to time, the Company may enter into arrangements with customers that combine the provision of development services and a license to the right to\nuse the Company’s IP.

Revenue\nis recognized upon the transfer of control, over time or at a point in time, depending on the nature of the arrangements. The Company evaluates whether the\nlicensing component is distinct. A licensing component is distinct if it is both (i) capable of being distinct and (ii) distinct in the context of the arrangement. If the\nlicense is not distinct, it is combined with the development services as a single performance obligation and recognized over time. If the license is distinct,\nrevenue is recognized at a point in time when the customer has the ability to benefit from the license.\nFrom time to time, the Company may enter into arrangements with customers that solely involve the sale or licensing of its patents or IP. Generally, there are no\nperformance obligations beyond transferring the designated license to the Company’s patents or IP. Accordingly, revenue is recognized at a point in time when\nthe customer has the ability to benefit from the license.\nThere are no variable consideration estimates associated with either combined development and IP arrangements or for standalone arrangements involving\neither the sale or licensing of IP.\nInventories\nThe Company values inventory at standard cost, adjusted to approximate the lower of actual cost or estimated net realizable value using assumptions about\nfuture demand and market conditions. In determining excess or obsolescence reserves for its products, the Company considers assumptions such as changes\nin business and economic conditions, other-than-temporary decreases in demand for its products, and changes in technology or customer requirements. In\ndetermining the lower of cost or net realizable value reserves, the Company considers assumptions such as recent historical sales activity and selling prices, as\nwell as estimates of future selling prices. The Company fully reserves for inventories and non-cancellable purchase orders for inventory deemed obsolete. The\nCompany performs periodic reviews of inventory items to identify excess inventories on hand by comparing on-hand balances and non-cancellable purchase\norders to anticipated usage using recent historical activity as well as anticipated or forecasted demand. If estimates of customer demand diminish further or\nmarket conditions become less favorable than those projected by the Company, additional inventory carrying value adjustments may be required.\n58\n\n\nTable of Contents\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company is required to use the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations.

When determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially\nwith respect to intangible assets. Critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, expected future revenue growth rates and\nmargins, future changes in technology, time to recreate customer relationships, useful lives, and discount rates. Fair value estimates are based on the\nassumptions that management believes a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability. These estimates are inherently uncertain and, therefore,\nactual results may differ from the estimates made. As a result, during the measurement period of up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may\nrecord adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or\nfinal determination of the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded in the\nConsolidated Statements of Operations.\nGoodwill\nThe Company performs its goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year and, if certain events or circumstances indicate that\nan impairment loss may have been incurred, on a more frequent basis. The analysis may include both qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the\nlikelihood of an impairment.\nThe Company has the option to first perform qualitative testing to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying\namount. Qualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, share price trends and market capitalization and\nCompany-specific events. If the Company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, the Company\ndoes not proceed to perform a quantitative impairment test.\nIf the Company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value or elects to bypass the qualitative test, a\nquantitative goodwill impairment test will be performed by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. The Company’s quantitative\nimpairment analysis uses a combination of the income approach, which requires estimates of the present value of expected future cash flows of a reporting\nunit, and the market approach, which uses financial ratios of comparable companies to arrive at an estimated value for the reporting units. Significant estimates\nand assumptions used in the income approach include assessments of macroeconomic conditions, growth rates of reporting units in the near- and long-term,\nexpectations of the Company’s ability to execute on roadmaps and projections, and the discount rate applied to cash flows.

Significant estimates used in the\nmarket approach include the identification of comparable companies for each reporting unit, and the determination of the appropriate multiples to apply to a\nreporting unit based on adjustments and consideration of specific attributes of that reporting unit. If a reporting unit’s fair value is determined to be less than its\ncarrying value, a goodwill impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying value, not to exceed\nthe total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nLong-Lived and Intangible Assets\nLong-lived and intangible assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment if indicators of potential impairment exist and at least annually for indefinite-\nlived intangible assets. Impairment indicators are reviewed on a quarterly basis. Assets are grouped and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level of\nidentifiable cash flows.\nWhen indicators of impairment exist and assets are held for use, the Company estimates future undiscounted cash flows attributable to the related asset\ngroups. In the event such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the recorded value of the assets, the assets are written down to their estimated\nfair values based on the expected discounted future cash flows attributable to the asset group or based on appraisals. Factors affecting impairment of assets\nheld for use include the ability of the specific assets to generate separately identifiable positive cash flows.\nWhen assets are removed from operations and held for sale, the Company estimates impairment losses as the excess of the carrying value of the assets over\ntheir fair value. Market conditions are among the factors affecting impairment of assets held for sale. Changes in any of these factors could necessitate\nimpairment recognition in future periods for assets held for use or assets held for sale.\n59\n\n\nTable of Contents\nCash Equivalents\nCash equivalents consist of financial instruments that are readily convertible into cash and have original maturities of three months or less at the time of\npurchase.\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable are primarily comprised of trade receivables presented net of rebates, price protection and an allowance for credit loss. Accounts\nreceivable also include unbilled receivables, which primarily represent work completed on development services recognized as revenue but not yet invoiced to\ncustomers and semi-custom products under non-cancellable purchase orders that have no alternative use to the Company at contract inception, for which\nrevenue has been recognized but not yet invoiced to customers. All unbilled accounts receivables are expected to be billed and collected within twelve months.\nThe Company manages its exposure to customer credit risk through credit limits, credit lines, ongoing monitoring procedures and credit approvals.\nFurthermore, the Company performs in-depth credit evalua",

From this, the Company may\nrequire letters of credit, bank or corporate guarantees or advance payments if deemed necessary. The Company maintains an allowance for credit loss,\nconsisting of known specific troubled accounts as well as an amount based on overall estimated potential uncollectible accounts receivable based on historical\nexperience and review of their current credit quality. The Company does not believe the receivable balance from its customers represents a significant credit\nrisk.\nInvestments\nAvailable for Sale Debt Securities. The Company classifies its investments in debt securities at the date of acquisition as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale\ndebt securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a\ncomponent of stockholders’ equity. If an available-for-sale debt security’s fair value is less than its amortized cost basis, then the Company evaluates whether\nthe decline is the result of a credit loss, in which case an impairment is recorded through an allowance for credit losses. Unrealized gains and losses not\nattributable to credit losses are included, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders’ equity. Classification of\navailable-for-sale debt securities as current or non-current is based on the Company’s intent and belief in its ability to sell these securities and use the proceeds\nfrom sale in operations within 12 months.\nNon-marketable Securities. The Company’s investments in non-marketable securities of privately-held companies are accounted for under the measurement\nalternative, defined as cost, less impairments, adjusted for subsequent observable price changes and are periodically assessed for impairment when events or\ncircumstances indicate that a decline in value may have occurred. The Company's periodic assessment of impairment is made by considering available\nevidence, including the investee’s general market and industry conditions and product development status. The Company also assesses the investee’s ability to\nmeet business milestones, its financial condition, and near-term prospects, including the rate at which the investee is using its cash, the investee’s need for\npossible additional funding at a lower valuation and any bona fide offer to purchase the investee.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company’s financial instruments are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, except for non-marketable equity investments in privately-\nheld companies, which are generally accounted for under the measurement alternative.\nFair Value Hierarchy\nThe fair value framework requires the categorization of assets and liabilities into three levels based upon the assumptions (inputs) used to price the assets or\nliabilities.

Level 3 assets and liabilities include those whose fair value measurements are determined using pricing models, discounted\ncash flow methodologies or similar valuation techniques, as well as significant management judgment or estimation.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of one to 15 years\nfor equipment, 34 to 44 years for buildings, and leasehold improvements are measured by the shorter of the remaining terms of the leases or the estimated\nuseful economic lives of the improvements.\nLeases\nOperating and finance leases are recorded as right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities on the Company’s balance sheet. ROU assets represent the\nCompany’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the\nlease. Operating and finance lease ROU assets and liabilities are initially recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. In\ndetermining the present value of lease payments, the Company uses the implicit interest rate if readily determinable. When the implicit interest rate is not\nreadily determinable, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate, which is based on its collateralized borrowing capabilities over a similar term of the\nlease payments. The Company utilizes the consolidated group incremental borrowing rate for all leases as the Company has centralized treasury operations.\nLease expense for operating lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company has elected the accounting policy to not\nrecognize ROU assets and lease liabilities that arise from short-term (12 months or less) leases for any class of underlying asset. Operating leases are included\nin operating lease ROU assets, other current liabilities, and long-term operating lease liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.

In addition, the Company’s marketing and advertising expenses include certain cooperative advertising funding\nobligations under customer incentive programs, which costs are recorded upon agreement with customers and vendor partners. Cooperative advertising\nexpenses are recorded as marketing, general and administrative expense to the extent the cash paid does not exceed the estimated fair value of the\nadvertising benefit received.

At the time an investment is made, investments in commercial paper of\nindustrial firms and financial institutions are rated A1, P1, F1 or better. The Company invests in bonds that are rated A, A2 or better and repurchase\nagreements, each of which have securities of the type and quality listed above as collateral.\nThe Company believes that concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited because a large number of geographically diverse\ncustomers make up the Company’s customer base, thus diluting the trade credit risk. One customer accounted for approximately 18% of the total consolidated\naccounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2022. Two customers each accounted for approximately 20% and 15% of the total consolidated accounts\nreceivable balance as of December 25, 2021. However, the Company does not believe the receivable balance from these customers represents a significant\ncredit risk based on past collection experience and review of their current credit quality.\nThe Company is exposed to credit losses from nonperformance by counterparties on foreign currency hedge contracts.

The reduction in income tax expense in 2022 was primarily due to the lower pre-tax income coupled with a $261 million FDII tax\nbenefit and $241 million of research and development (R&D) tax credits.\nBeginning in 2022, provisions in the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 require the Company to capitalize and amortize R&D expenditures rather than\ndeducting the costs as incurred. The capitalization resulted in an increase in 2022 taxable income which also increased the income eligible for the FDII tax\nbenefit. Additionally, there was a pre-tax loss incurred outside of the U.S. primarily due to the GAAP amortization of Xilinx acquisition-related items and\ntherefore, the Company recorded a corresponding tax benefit associated with the reversal of the previously established GILTI deferred tax liability.\nAs a part of the Xilinx acquisition and as a result of certain employment and operational commitments the Company has made in Singapore, the Company has\nbeen granted a Development and Expansion Incentive (DEI) that is effective through 2031. The DEI reduces the local tax on Singapore income from a statutory\nrate of 17% to 5% through 2031. Due to the current year pre-tax loss, the Company did not receive any income tax or EPS benefit.\n82\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe Company recorded an income tax provision of $513 million in 2021 and an income tax benefit of $1.2 billion in 2020, representing effective tax rates of\n14% and (95)% respectively.

The chemicals released into the groundwater were commonly used in the semiconductor industry in the United States\nin the wafer fabrication process prior to 1979.\nIn 1991, the Company received Final Site Clean-up Requirements Orders from the California Regional Water Quality Control Board relating to the three sites.\nThe Company has entered into settlement agreements with other responsible parties on two of the orders. During the term of such agreements, other parties\nhave agreed to assume most of the foreseeable costs as well as the primary role in conducting remediation activities under the orders. The Company remains\nresponsible for additional costs beyond the scope of the agreements as well as all remaining costs in the event that the other parties do not fulfill their\nobligations under the settlement agreements.\nTo address anticipated future remediation costs under the orders, the Company has computed and recorded an estimated environmental liability of\napproximately $3.9 million and has not recorded any potential insurance recoveries in determining the estimated costs of the cleanup.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated\nfinancial statements, the Company adjusts the inventory carrying value to the lower of actual cost or the estimated net realizable\nvalue after completing ongoing reviews of on-hand inventory quantities exceeding forecasted demand and by considering recent\nhistorical activity as well as anticipated demand. Auditing management’s inventory carrying value adjustments involved\nsignificant judgment because the estimates are based on several factors that are affected by market, industry, and competitive\nconditions outside the Company's control. In estimating inventory carrying value adjustments, management developed\nassumptions such as forecasts of future sales quantities and the selling prices, which are sensitive to the competitiveness of\nproduct offerings, customer requirements, and product life cycles. These significant assumptions are forward-looking and could\nbe affected by future economic and market conditions.\nHow We Addressed the\nMatter in Our Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the\nCompany's inventory carrying value adjustment determination process, including the basis for developing the above-described\nassumptions and management’s judgments.\nOur audit procedures included, among others, testing the reasonableness of management’s key assumptions and judgments\nand testing the accuracy and completeness of the underlying data used to determine the amount of inventory carrying value\nadjustm",

(“Xilinx”) for consideration of $48.8 billion, as\ndisclosed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination.\nAuditing the Company's accounting for its acquisition of Xilinx was complex due to the significant estimation uncertainty in the\nCompany’s determination of the fair value of certain identified intangible assets, principally consisting of developed technology\nand customer relationships. The significant estimation uncertainty was primarily due to the sensitivity of the respective fair values\nto underlying assumptions about the future performance of the acquired business. The Company used a discounted cash flow\nmodel to measure the developed technology and customer relationship intangible assets. The significant assumptions used to\nestimate the value of these intangible assets included certain assumptions that form the basis of the forecasted results,\nspecifically, revenue growth rates, technology migration curves, and time to recreate customer relationships. These significant\nassumptions are forward looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions.\nHow We Addressed the\nMatter in Our Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s\naccounting for the acquisition. This included testing controls over the estimation process supporting the recognition and\nmeasurement of the developed technology and customer relationships intangible assets, including the valuation models and\nunderlying assumptions used to develop such estimates.\nTo test the estimated fair value of the developed technology and customer relationships intangible assets, we performed audit\nprocedures that included, among others, evaluating the Company's selection of the valuation methodology, evaluating the\nmethods and significant assumptions used by the Company, and evaluating the completeness and accuracy of the underlying\ndata supporting the ",

Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Information Gathered**: \n   - There are mentions of revenue growth, particularly in segments like Data Center and Gaming, which could impact operating margin.\n   - Some outputs mention increased costs due to acquisitions (e.g., Xilinx and Pensando) and strategic initiatives.\n   - There are references to increased R&D and marketing expenses, which could affect operating margin.\n   - A few outputs mention the impact of market conditions, such as weak PC market conditions and inventory corrections.\n\n2. **Sufficiency of Information**: \n   - The information is fragmented and lacks a cohesive narrative or detailed financial metrics that directly explain changes in operating margin.\n   - There is no comprehensive analysis of how revenue growth, cost changes, and strategic initiatives collectively impacted the operating margin.\n\n3. **Missing Information**:\n   - Detailed financial statements, particularly the income statement, to see the exact changes in revenue, cost of goods sold, and operating expenses.\n   - Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) section for qualitative insights on strategic decisions and market conditions affecting operating margin.\n   - Specific figures on operating income and margin percentages for FY22 compared to previous years.\n\n4. **Calculation or Derivation**:\n   - If sufficient data were available, the operating margin could be calculated as (Operating Income / Revenue) * 100. Changes could then be analyzed by comparing these figures year-over-year and identifying key drivers from the financial statements and MD&A.\n\n5. **Conflicting Answers**:\n   - There are no direct conflicting answers, but the lack of detailed citations and financial data makes it difficult to resolve any discrepancies in the information provided.\n\nIn conclusion, the gathered information is not sufficient to definitively answer the question.

Intel’s market share, margins and significant financial resources\nenable it to market its products aggressively, to target our customers and our channel partners with special incentives and to influence customers who do\nbusiness with us. These aggressive activities have in the past resulted in lower unit sales and a lower average selling price for many of our products and\nadversely affected our margins and profitability.\nIntel exerts substantial influence over computer manufacturers and their channels of distribution through various brand and other marketing programs. As a\nresult of Intel’s position in the microprocessor market, Intel has been able to control x86 microprocessor and computer system standards and benchmarks and\nto dictate the type of products the microprocessor market requires of us. Intel also dominates the computer system platform, which includes core logic chipsets,\ngraphics chips, networking devices (wired and wireless), non-volatile storage and other components necessary to assemble a computer system. Additionally,\nIntel is able to drive de facto standards and specifications for x86 microprocessors that could cause us and other companies to have delayed access to such\nstandards.\nAs long as Intel remains in this dominant position, we may be materially adversely affected by Intel’s business practices, including rebating and allocation\nstrategies and pricing actions, designed to limit our market share and margins; product mix and introduction schedules; product bundling, marketing and\nmerchandising strategies; exclusivity payments to its current and potential customers, retailers and channel partners; de facto control over industry standards,\nand heavy influence on PC manufacturers and other PC industry participants, including motherboard, memory, chipset and basic input/output system (BIOS)\nsuppliers and software companies as well as the graphics interface for Intel platforms; and marketing and advertising expenditures in support of positioning the\nIntel brand over the brand of its original equipment manufacturer (OEM) customers and retailers.\nIntel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on marketing and research and\ndevelopment than we do.

A substantial delay in the technology transitions to smaller process technologies could\nhave a material adverse effect on us, particularly if our competitors transition to more cost effective technologies before us. For example, we are presently\nfocusing our 7 nm and lower product microprocessor and GPU portfolio on TSMC’s processes.

A decrease in the long-term economic outlook and future cash flows of our business could significantly impact asset values and potentially result in\nthe impairment of goodwill and may require us to record future goodwill impairment charges, which may have a material adverse impact on our financial\nposition and results of operations.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources Risks\nThe agreements governing our notes, our guarantees of the Assumed Xilinx Notes, and our Revolving Credit Agr",

In February 2022, we completed our strategic\nacquisition of Xilinx, Inc. (Xilinx) which expanded our technology and product portfolio to include adaptable hardware platforms that enable hardware\nacceleration and rapid innovation across a variety of technologies and established AMD in multiple embedded markets where we have traditionally not had a\nsignificant presence. We now offer Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), Adaptive SoCs, and Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform (ACAP) products.\nWith the acquisition of Xilinx, we have access to a new set of markets and customers, further strengthening and diversifying our business model. In May 2022,\nwe expanded our data center solutions capabilities with the acquisition of Pensando Systems, Inc. (Pensando). We now offer high-performance data\nprocessing units (DPUs) and a software stack that complements our existing products. With the Xilinx and Pensando acquisitions, we are well positioned to\nprovide the industry’s broadest set of leadership compute engines and accelerators to help enable best performance, security, flexibility and total cost of\nownership for leading-edge data centers.\nOur 2022 financial results reflect the strength of our diversified business model despite the challenging PC market conditions in the second half of 2022. Net\nrevenue for 2022 was $23.6 billion, an increase of 44% compared to 2021 net revenue of $16.4 billion. The increase in net revenue was driven by a 64%\nincrease in Data Center segment revenue primarily due to higher sales of our EPYC™ server processors, a 21% increase in Gaming segment revenue\nprimarily due to higher semi-custom product sales, and a significant increase in Embedded segment revenue from the prior year period driven by the inclusion\nof Xilinx embedded product sales. This growth was partially offset by a 10% decrease in Client segment revenue primarily due to lower processor shipments\ndriven by a weak PC market and significant inventory correction actions across the PC supply chain. Gross margin, as a percentage of net revenue for 2022,\nwas 45%, compared to 48% in 2021. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition.\nOperating income for 2022 was $1.3 billion compared to operating income of $3.6 billion for 2021. The decrease in operating income was primarily driven by\namortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition. Net income for 2022 was $1.3 billion compared to $3.2 billion in the prior year. The\ndecrease in net income was primarily driven by lower operating income.\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2022 were $5.9 billion, compared to $3.6 billion at the end of 2021.

We evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis, including\nthose related to our revenue, inventories, business combination, goodwill, long-lived and intangible assets, and income taxes. We base our estimates on\nhistorical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for\nmaking judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Although actual results have historically been reasonably consistent with management’s\nexpectations, the actual results may differ from these estimates or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions.\nManagement believes the following critical accounting estimates are the most significant to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most\ndifficult, subjective and complex judgments.\nRevenue Allowances.  Revenue contracts with our customers include variable amounts which we evaluate under ASC 606-10-32-8 through 14 in order to\ndetermine the net amount of consideration to which we are entitled and which we recognize as revenue.

For transactions where we reimburse a customer for a portion of the customer’s cost to perform\nspecific product advertising or marketing and promotional activities, such amounts are recognized as a reduction to revenue unless they qualify for expense\nrecognition.\nWe also provide limited product return rights to certain OEMs and to most distribution customers. These return rights are generally limited to a contractual\npercentage of the customer’s prior quarter shipments, although, from time to time we may approve additional product returns beyond the contractual\narrangements based on the applicable facts and circumstances. In order to estimate adjustments to revenue to account for these returns, including product\nrestocking rights provided to distributor and OEM customers, we utilize relevant, trended actual historical product return rate information gathered, adjusted for\nactual known information or events, as applicable.\nOverall, our estimates of adjustments to contract price due to variable consideration under our contracts with OEM and distributor customers, based on our\nassumptions and include adjustments, if any, for known events, have been materially consistent with actual results; however, these estimates are subject to\nmanagement’s judgment and actual provisions could be different from our estimates and current provisions, resulting in future adjustments to our revenue and\noperating results.\n42\n\n\nTable of Contents\nInventory Valuation. We value inventory at standard cost, adjusted to approximate the lower of actual cost or estimated net realizable value using assumptions\nabout future demand and market conditions.

In determining excess or obsolescence reserves for products, we consider assumptions such as\nchanges in business and economic conditions, other-than-temporary decreases in demand for our products, and changes in technology or customer\nrequirements. In determining the lower of cost or net realizable value reserves, we consider assumptions such as recent historical sales activity and selling\nprices, as well as estimates of future selling prices.

Overall, our estimates of inventory carrying value adjustments have been materially consistent with actual results.\nBusiness Combinations. We allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired\nbased on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is\nrecorded as goodwill. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets.\nSignificant estimates in valuing developed technology, in-process research and development, customer relationships and other identifiable intangible assets\ninclude, but are not limited to, expected future revenue growth rates and margins, future changes in technology, time to recreate customer relationships, useful\nlives, and discount rates.\nManagement's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a\nresult, actual results may differ from estimates. Allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable assets and liabilities affects our amortization expense, as\nacquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the useful life, whereas any indefinite lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortized.\nDuring the measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.\nGoodwill. Goodwill is the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred over the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection\nwith business combinations. Our reporting units are at the operating segment level. Our goodwill is contained within three reporting units: Data Center, Gaming\nand Embedded.\nWe perform our goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year and, if certain events or circumstances indicate that an\nimpairment loss may have been incurred, on a more frequent basis.

The fair values of our reporting units are estimated using a combination of the income approach, which requires estimating the present value of expected\nfuture cash flows of a reporting unit, and the market approach, which uses financial ratios of comparable companies to arrive at an estimated value for the\nreporting unit. Significant estimates and assumptions used in the income approach include assessments of macroeconomic conditions, growth rates of our\nreporting units in the near- and long-term, expectations of our ability to execute on our roadmap and projections, and the discount rate applied to cash flows.\nSignificant estimates used in the market approach include the identification of comparable companies for each reporting unit, the determination of an\nappropriate control premium that a market participant would apply to a reporting unit, and the determination of appropriate multiples to apply to a reporting unit\nbased on adjustments and consideration of specific attributes of that reporting unit.\n43\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe most significant assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair values of our reporting units are the sales and earnings growth rates\n(including long-term growth rates) and discount rates. Long-term growth rates are dependent on overall market growth rates, the competitive environment and\ninflation. As a result, long-term growth rates could be adversely impacted by a sustained deceleration in category growth or an increased competitive\nenvironment. Discount rates, which are consistent with a weighted average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by a market participant, are based upon\nindustry required rates of return, including consideration of both debt and equity components of the capital structure. Our discount rates may be impacted by\nadverse changes in the macroeconomic environment, prolonged and continuing inflationary pressures, volatility in the equity and debt markets and other factors\nthat otherwise create or exacerbate risks in our reporting units. Changes in operating plans or adverse changes in the business or in the macroeconomic\nenvironment in the future could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair values and could result in a decline in fair value that would trigger future\nimpairment charges of our reporting units’ goodwill. Based on our annual impairment testing, the fair values of all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying\nvalues.\nLong-Lived and Intangible Assets. Long-lived and intangible assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment if indicators of potential impairment exist\nand at least annually for indefinite-lived intangible assets. Impairment indicators are reviewed on a quarterly basis. Assets are grouped and evaluated for\nimpairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. When indi",

In the event such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the recorded value of the assets, the\nassets are written down to their estimated fair values based on the expected discounted future cash flows attributable to the asset group or based on\nappraisals. Factors affecting impairment of assets held for use include the ability of the specific assets to generate separately identifiable positive cash flows.\nWhen assets are removed from operations and held for sale, we estimate impairment losses as the excess of the carrying value of the assets over their fair\nvalue. Market conditions are among the factors affecting impairment of assets held for sale. Changes in any of these factors could necessitate impairment\nrecognition in future periods for assets held for use or assets held for sale.\nIncome Taxes. In determining taxable income for financial statement reporting purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and\njudgments are applied in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets which arise from temporary\ndifferences between the recognition of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement reporting purposes.\nWe regularly assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. Unless recovery is considered more-likely-than-not (a probability level\nof more than 50%), we will record a charge to income tax expense in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not\nultimately be recoverable or maintain the valuation allowance recorded in prior periods. When considering all available evidence, if we determine it is more-\nlikely-than-not we will realize our deferred tax assets, we will reverse some or all of the existing valuation allowance, which would result in a credit to income tax\nexpense and the establishment of an asset in the period of reversal.\nIn determining the need to establish or maintain a valuation allowance, we consider the four sources of jurisdictional taxable income: (i) carryback of net\noperating losses to prior years; (ii) future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences; (iii) viable and prudent tax planning strategies; and (iv) future\ntaxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards.\nThrough the end of 2022, we continue to maintain a valuation allowance of approximately $2.1 billion for certain federal, state, and foreign tax attributes. The\nfederal valuation allowance maintained is due to limitations, under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 or 383, separate return loss year rules, or dual\nconsolidated loss rules. Certain state and foreign valuation allowances are maintained due to a lack of sufficient sources of future taxable income.\nIn addition, the c",

The change was primarily due to a $62 million decrease in the\nfair value of equity investments in 2022 compared to an increase in fair value of $56 million from equity investments in 2021, partially offset by $65 million of\ninterest income driven mainly by rising interest rates in 2022 compared to losses from conversion of our convertible debt of $7 million in 2021.\nIncome Tax Provision (Benefit)\nWe recorded an income tax benefit of $122 million in 2022 and an income tax provision of $513 million in 2021, representing effective tax rates of (10%) and\n14%, respectively. The reduction in income tax expense in 2022 was primarily due to the lower pre-tax income coupled with a $261 million foreign-derived\nintangible income tax benefit and $241 million of research and development tax credits.\nThrough the end of fiscal year 2022, we continued to maintain a valuation allowance of approximately $2.1 billion for certain federal, state, and foreign tax\nattributes.

There were no funds drawn from this facility during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nOn November 3, 2022, we established a new commercial paper program where we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum principal\namount outstanding at any time of $3.0 billion with a maturity of up to 397 days from the date of issue.

Our portfolio includes investments in marketable debt securities with\nactive secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity. We are averse to principal loss and strive to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk\nand market risk.\nWe actively monitor market conditions and developments specific to the securities and security classes in which we invest.

Fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 ended on December 31,\n2022, December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020, respectively. Fiscal 2022 consisted of 53 weeks, and fiscal 2021 and 2020 each consisted of 52 weeks.\nPrinciples of Consolidation.  The consolidated financial statements include the Company’s accounts and those of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Upon\nconsolidation, all inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated.\nReclassification. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.\nUse of Estimates. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requires\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of commitments and contingencies at\nthe date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results are likely to differ from\nthose estimates, and such differences may be material to the financial statements. Areas where management uses subjective judgment include, but are not\nlimited to, revenue allowances, inventory valuation, valuation of goodwill and long-lived and intangible assets, and income taxes.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration which the\nCompany expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Sales, value-added, and other taxes collected concurrently with the provision of goods or\nservices are excluded from revenue. Shipping and handling costs associated with product sales are included in cost of sales. Substantially all the Company’s\nrevenue is derived from product sales, representing a single performance obligation.\nCustomers are generally required to pay for products and services within the Company’s standard contractual terms, which are typically net 30 to 60 days. The\nCompany has determined that it does not have significant financing components in its contracts with customers.\nNon-custom products\nThe Company transf",

Non-custom product arrangements generally comprise a single\nperformance obligation. Certain OEMs may be entitled to rights of return and rebates under OEM agreements. The Company also sells to distributors under\nterms allowing the majority of distributors certain rights of return and price protection on unsold merchandise held by them. The Company estimates the amount\nof variable consideration under OEM and distributor arrangements and, accordingly, records a provision for product returns, allowances for price protection and\nrebates based on actual historical experience and any known events.\n57\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe Company offers incentive programs to certain customers, including cooperative advertising, marketing promotions, volume-based incentives and special\npricing arrangements. Where funds provided for such programs can be estimated, the Company recognizes a reduction to revenue at the time the related\nrevenue is recognized; otherwise, the Company recognizes such reduction to revenue at the later of when: i) the related revenue transaction occurs; or ii) the\nprogram is offered. For transactions where the Company reimburses a customer for a portion of the customer’s cost to perform specific product advertising or\nmarketing and promotional activities, such amounts are recognized as a reduction to revenue unless they qualify for expense recognition.\nConstraints of variable consideration have not been material.\nCustom products\nCustom products which are associated with the Company’s Gaming segment (semi-custom products), sold under non-cancellable purchases orders, for which\nthe Company has an enforceable right to payment, and which have no alternative use to the Company at contract inception, are recognized as revenue, over\nthe time of production of the products by the Company. The Company utilizes a cost-based input method, calculated as cost incurred plus estimated margin, to\ndetermine the amount of revenue to recognize for in-process, but incomplete, customer orders at a reporting date. The Company believes that a cost-based\ninput method is the most appropriate manner to measure how the Company satisfies its performance obligations to customers because the effort and costs\nincurred best depict the Company’s satisfaction of its performance obligation.\nSales of semi-custom products are not subject to a right of return. Custom products arrangements generally involve a single performance obligation.

A licensing component is distinct if it is both (i) capable of being distinct and (ii) distinct in the context of the arrangement. If the\nlicense is not distinct, it is combined with the development services as a single performance obligation and recognized over time. If the license is distinct,\nrevenue is recognized at a point in time when the customer has the ability to benefit from the license.\nFrom time to time, the Company may enter into arrangements with customers that solely involve the sale or licensing of its patents or IP. Generally, there are no\nperformance obligations beyond transferring the designated license to the Company’s patents or IP. Accordingly, revenue is recognized at a point in time when\nthe customer has the ability to benefit from the license.\nThere are no variable consideration estimates associated with either combined development and IP arrangements or for standalone arrangements involving\neither the sale or licensing of IP.\nInventories\nThe Company values inventory at standard cost, adjusted to approximate the lower of actual cost or estimated net realizable value using assumptions about\nfuture demand and market conditions. In determining excess or obsolescence reserves for its products, the Company considers assumptions such as changes\nin business and economic conditions, other-than-temporary decreases in demand for its products, and changes in technology or customer requirements. In\ndetermining the lower of cost or net realizable value reserves, the Company considers assumptions such as recent historical sales activity and selling prices, as\nwell as estimates of future selling prices. The Company fully reserves for inventories and non-cancellable purchase orders for inventory deemed obsolete.

When determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially\nwith respect to intangible assets. Critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, expected future revenue growth rates and\nmargins, future changes in technology, time to recreate customer relationships, useful lives, and discount rates. Fair value estimates are based on the\nassumptions that management believes a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability. These estimates are inherently uncertain and, therefore,\nactual results may differ from the estimates made. As a result, during the measurement period of up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may\nrecord adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or\nfinal determination of the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded in the\nConsolidated Statements of Operations.\nGoodwill\nThe Company performs its goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year and, if certain events or circumstances indicate that\nan impairment loss may have been incurred, on a more frequent basis. The analysis may include both qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the\nlikelihood of an impairment.\nThe Company has the option to first perform qualitative testing to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying\namount. Qualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, share price trends and market capitalization and\nCompany-specific events. If the Company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, the Company\ndoes not proceed to perform a quantitative impairment test.\nIf the Company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value or elects to bypass the qualitative test, a\nquantitative goodwill impairment test will be performed by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. The Company’s quantitative\nimpairment analysis uses a combination of the income approach, which requires estimates of the present value of expected future cash flows of a reporting\nunit, and the market approach, which uses financial ratios of comparable companies to arrive at an estimated value for the reporting units. Significant estimates\nand assumptions used in the income approach include assessments of macroeconomic conditions, growth rates of reporting units in the near- and long-term,\nexpectations of the Company’s ability to execute on roadmaps and projections, and the discount rate applied to cash flows.

Significant estimates used in the\nmarket approach include the identification of comparable companies for each reporting unit, and the determination of the appropriate multiples to apply to a\nreporting unit based on adjustments and consideration of specific attributes of that reporting unit. If a reporting unit’s fair value is determined to be less than its\ncarrying value, a goodwill impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying value, not to exceed\nthe total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nLong-Lived and Intangible Assets\nLong-lived and intangible assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment if indicators of potential impairment exist and at least annually for indefinite-\nlived intangible assets. Impairment indicators are reviewed on a quarterly basis. Assets are grouped and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level of\nidentifiable cash flows.\nWhen indicators of impairment exist and assets are held for use, the Company estimates future undiscounted cash flows attributable to the related asset\ngroups. In the event such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the recorded value of the assets, the assets are written down to their estimated\nfair values based on the expected discounted future cash flows attributable to the asset group or based on appraisals. Factors affecting impairment of assets\nheld for use include the ability of the specific assets to generate separately identifiable positive cash flows.\nWhen assets are removed from operations and held for sale, the Company estimates impairment losses as the excess of the carrying value of the assets over\ntheir fair value. Market conditions are among the factors affecting impairment of assets held for sale. Changes in any of these factors could necessitate\nimpairment recognition in future periods for assets held for use or assets held for sale.\n59\n\n\nTable of Contents\nCash Equivalents\nCash equivalents consist of financial instruments that are readily convertible into cash and have original maturities of three months or less at the time of\npurchase.\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable are primarily comprised of trade receivables presented net of rebates, price protection and an allowance for credit loss.

The Company does not believe the receivable balance from its customers represents a significant credit\nrisk.\nInvestments\nAvailable for Sale Debt Securities. The Company classifies its investments in debt securities at the date of acquisition as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale\ndebt securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a\ncomponent of stockholders’ equity. If an available-for-sale debt security’s fair value is less than its amortized cost basis, then the Company evaluates whether\nthe decline is the result of a credit loss, in which case an impairment is recorded through an allowance for credit losses. Unrealized gains and losses not\nattributable to credit losses are included, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders’ equity. Classification of\navailable-for-sale debt securities as current or non-current is based on the Company’s intent and belief in its ability to sell these securities and use the proceeds\nfrom sale in operations within 12 months.\nNon-marketable Securities. The Company’s investments in non-marketable securities of privately-held companies are accounted for under the measurement\nalternative, defined as cost, less impairments, adjusted for subsequent observable price changes and are periodically assessed for impairment when events or\ncircumstances indicate that a decline in value may have occurred. The Company's periodic assessment of impairment is made by considering available\nevidence, including the investee’s general market and industry conditions and product development status. The Company also assesses the investee’s ability to\nmeet business milestones, its financial condition, and near-term prospects, including the rate at which the investee is using its cash, the investee’s need for\npossible additional funding at a lower valuation and any bona fide offer to purchase the investee.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company’s financial instruments are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, except for non-marketable equity investments in privately-\nheld companies, which are generally accounted for under the measurement alternative.\nFair Value Hierarchy\nThe fair value framework requires the categorization of assets and liabilities into three levels based upon the assumptions (inputs) used to price the assets or\nliabilities.

Depreciation and amortization are provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of one to 15 years\nfor equipment, 34 to 44 years for buildings, and leasehold improvements are measured by the shorter of the remaining terms of the leases or the estimated\nuseful economic lives of the improvements.\nLeases\nOperating and finance leases are recorded as right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities on the Company’s balance sheet. ROU assets represent the\nCompany’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the\nlease. Operating and finance lease ROU assets and liabilities are initially recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. In\ndetermining the present value of lease payments, the Company uses the implicit interest rate if readily determinable. When the implicit interest rate is not\nreadily determinable, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate, which is based on its collateralized borrowing capabilities over a similar term of the\nlease payments. The Company utilizes the consolidated group incremental borrowing rate for all leases as the Company has centralized treasury operations.\nLease expense for operating lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company has elected the accounting policy to not\nrecognize ROU assets and lease liabilities that arise from short-term (12 months or less) leases for any class of underlying asset.

This\naccounting policy change resulted in the recording of $857 million of deferred tax liabilities in connection with the Xilinx acquisition as disclosed in Note 14 -\nIncome Taxes.

Prior to 2022, the Company reported any interest expense related to unrecognized tax benefits as a\ncomponent of Interest expense and reported any related penalties as a component of Income tax provision (benefit). In 2022, the Company elected to change\nits method of accounting for tax interest expense from Interest expense to the Income tax provision (benefit) line in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThis change in classification is considered preferable as it i) better aligns classification of tax interest with the substance of the underlying tax positions, which\nare managed inclusive of interest, ii) allows for greater visibility to the cost of the Company’s debt and other financing activities, and iii) better aligns with\ncommon industry practice and provides increased comparability. This accounting policy change resulted in a decrease in Interest expense and corresponding\nincrease to i) Income before income taxes and equity income and ii) Income tax provision (benefit) as reported on the Consolidated Statements of Operations of\n$11 million in 2022.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated\nfinancial statements, the Company adjusts the inventory carrying value to the lower of actual cost or the estimated net realizable\nvalue after completing ongoing reviews of on-hand inventory quantities exceeding forecasted demand and by considering recent\nhistorical activity as well as anticipated demand. Auditing management’s inventory carrying value adjustments involved\nsignificant judgment because the estimates are based on several factors that are affected by market, industry, and competitive\nconditions outside the Company's control. In estimating inventory carrying value adjustments, management developed\nassumptions such as forecasts of future sales quantities and the selling prices, which are sensitive to the competitiveness of\nproduct offerings, customer requirements, and product life cycles. These significant assumptions are forward-looking and could\nbe affected by future economic and market conditions.\nHow We Addressed the\nMatter in Our Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the\nCompany's inventory carrying value adjustment determination process, including the basis for developing the above-described\nassumptions and management’s judgments.\nOur audit procedures included, among others, testing the reasonableness of management’s key assumptions and judgments\nand testing the accuracy and completeness of the underlying data used to determine the amount of inventory carrying value\nadjustm",

(“Xilinx”) for consideration of $48.8 billion, as\ndisclosed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination.\nAuditing the Company's accounting for its acquisition of Xilinx was complex due to the significant estimation uncertainty in the\nCompany’s determination of the fair value of certain identified intangible assets, principally consisting of developed technology\nand customer relationships. The significant estimation uncertainty was primarily due to the sensitivity of the respective fair values\nto underlying assumptions about the future performance of the acquired business. The Company used a discounted cash flow\nmodel to measure the developed technology and customer relationship intangible assets. The significant assumptions used to\nestimate the value of these intangible assets included certain assumptions that form the basis of the forecasted results,\nspecifically, revenue growth rates, technology migration curves, and time to recreate customer relationships. These significant\nassumptions are forward looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions.\nHow We Addressed the\nMatter in Our Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s\naccounting for the acquisition. This included testing controls over the estimation process supporting the recognition and\nmeasurement of the developed technology and customer relationships intangible assets, including the valuation models and\nunderlying assumptions used to develop such estimates.\nTo test the estimated fair value of the developed technology and customer relationships intangible assets, we performed audit\nprocedures that included, among others, evaluating the Company's selection of the valuation methodology, evaluating the\nmethods and significant assumptions used by the Company, and evaluating the completeness and accuracy of the underlying\ndata supporting the ",

A company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect\nthe transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being\nmade only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or\ntimely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n93\n\n\nTable of Contents\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance\nwith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nSan Jose, California\nFebruary 27, 2023\n94\n\n\nTable of Contents\nITEM 9.

If sufficient, how we would calculate or derive the answer\n5. If there are conflicting answers:\n--> Use citations to select the correct answer if there are conflicting answers.\n\nBe brief and concise. No need for structured output - just think through the steps. You MUST respond in markdown format (for $ signs make sure to use escape character \\ before the $ sign).\n",
      "output": "### Analysis\n\n1. **Information Gathered:**\n   - The collected outputs mention several factors that could influence AMD's operating margin, including:\n     - Revenue growth in specific segments like Data Center and Embedded.\n     - Increased costs due to acquisitions, particularly the Xilinx acquisition, which led to significant amortization of intangible assets.\n     - Market conditions, such as competition from Intel and economic uncertainties.\n     - Changes in operating income across different segments.\n     - Increased operating expenses due to strategic investments and acquisitions.\n     - Impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\n     - Inventory write-downs and changes in gross margin.\n\n2. **Sufficiency of Information:**\n   - The information is somewhat fragmented but provides a basis to understand the drivers of operating margin changes. However, it lacks a cohesive analysis or detailed financial metrics that directly quantify the impact on operating margin.\n\n3. **Missing Information:**\n   - A direct calculation or statement of the operating margin change from FY21 to FY22.\n   - A comprehensive analysis that ties together the various factors affecting the operating margin.\n   - Specific financial metrics or management commentary that explicitly state the operating margin change.\n\n4. **Deriving the Answer:**\n   - To derive the answer, we would need to calculate the operating margin for FY21 and FY22 using the formula: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Operating Margin} = \\left(\\frac{\\text{Operating Income}}{\\text{Net Revenue}}\\right) \\times 100\n     \\]\n   - We would then compare the two years to determine the change and analyze the factors contributing to this change based on the gathered information.\n\n5. **Conflicting Answers:**\n   - There are no direct conflicting answers, but the information is scattered and lacks a unified narrative. The citations provided do not directly address the operating margin change, making it challenging to resolve any discrepancies.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe gathered information provides insights into potential drivers of operating margin changes for AMD in FY22, but it is not sufficient to definitively answer the question. A more detailed financial analysis and direct statements from the financial documents are needed to accurately quantify and explain the operating margin change."

Intel also dominates the computer system platform, which includes core logic chipsets,\ngraphics chips, networking devices (wired and wireless), non-volatile storage and other components necessary to assemble a computer system. Additionally,\nIntel is able to drive de facto standards and specifications for x86 microprocessors that could cause us and other companies to have delayed access to such\nstandards.\nAs long as Intel remains in this dominant position, we may be materially adversely affected by Intel’s business practices, including rebating and allocation\nstrategies and pricing actions, designed to limit our market share and margins; product mix and introduction schedules; product bundling, marketing and\nmerchandising strategies; exclusivity payments to its current and potential customers, retailers and channel partners; de facto control over industry standards,\nand heavy influence on PC manufacturers and other PC industry participants, including motherboard, memory, chipset and basic input/output system (BIOS)\nsuppliers and software companies as well as the graphics interface for Intel platforms; and marketing and advertising expenditures in support of positioning the\nIntel brand over the brand of its original equipment manufacturer (OEM) customers and retailers.\nIntel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on marketing and research and\ndevelopment than we do.

In February 2022, we completed our strategic\nacquisition of Xilinx, Inc. (Xilinx) which expanded our technology and product portfolio to include adaptable hardware platforms that enable hardware\nacceleration and rapid innovation across a variety of technologies and established AMD in multiple embedded markets where we have traditionally not had a\nsignificant presence. We now offer Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), Adaptive SoCs, and Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform (ACAP) products.\nWith the acquisition of Xilinx, we have access to a new set of markets and customers, further strengthening and diversifying our business model. In May 2022,\nwe expanded our data center solutions capabilities with the acquisition of Pensando Systems, Inc. (Pensando). We now offer high-performance data\nprocessing units (DPUs) and a software stack that complements our existing products. With the Xilinx and Pensando acquisitions, we are well positioned to\nprovide the industry’s broadest set of leadership compute engines and accelerators to help enable best performance, security, flexibility and total cost of\nownership for leading-edge data centers.\nOur 2022 financial results reflect the strength of our diversified business model despite the challenging PC market conditions in the second half of 2022. Net\nrevenue for 2022 was $23.6 billion, an increase of 44% compared to 2021 net revenue of $16.4 billion. The increase in net revenue was driven by a 64%\nincrease in Data Center segment revenue primarily due to higher sales of our EPYC™ server processors, a 21% increase in Gaming segment revenue\nprimarily due to higher semi-custom product sales, and a significant increase in Embedded segment revenue from the prior year period driven by the inclusion\nof Xilinx embedded product sales. This growth was partially offset by a 10% decrease in Client segment revenue primarily due to lower processor shipments\ndriven by a weak PC market and significant inventory correction actions across the PC supply chain. Gross margin, as a percentage of net revenue for 2022,\nwas 45%, compared to 48% in 2021. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition.\nOperating income for 2022 was $1.3 billion compared to operating income of $3.6 billion for 2021. The decrease in operating income was primarily driven by\namortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition. Net income for 2022 was $1.3 billion compared to $3.2 billion in the prior year. The\ndecrease in net income was primarily driven by lower operating income.\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2022 were $5.9 billion, compared to $3.6 billion at the end of 2021.

We evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis, including\nthose related to our revenue, inventories, business combination, goodwill, long-lived and intangible assets, and income taxes. We base our estimates on\nhistorical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for\nmaking judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Although actual results have historically been reasonably consistent with management’s\nexpectations, the actual results may differ from these estimates or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions.\nManagement believes the following critical accounting estimates are the most significant to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most\ndifficult, subjective and complex judgments.\nRevenue Allowances.  Revenue contracts with our customers include variable amounts which we evaluate under ASC 606-10-32-8 through 14 in order to\ndetermine the net amount of consideration to which we are entitled and which we recognize as revenue. We determine the net amount of consideration to\nwhich we are entitled by estimating the most likely amount of consideration we expect to receive from the customer after adjustments to the contract price for\nrights of return and rebates to our original equipment manufacturers (OEM) customers and rights of return, rebates and price protection on unsold merchandise\nto our distributor customers.\nWe base our determination of necessary adjustments to the contract price by reference to actual historical activity and experience, including actual historical\nreturns, rebates and credits issued to OEM and distributor customers adjusted, as applicable, to include adjustments, if any, for known events or current\neconomic conditions, or both.\nOur estimates of necessary adjustments for distributor price incentives and price protection on unsold products held by distributors are based on actual\nhistorical incentives provided to distributor customers and known future price movements based on our internal and external market data analysis.\nOur estimates of necessary adjustments for OEM price incentives utilize, in addition to known pricing agreements, actual historical rebate attainment rates and\nestimates of future OEM rebate program attainment based on internal and external market data analysis.\nWe offer incent",

Where funds provided for such programs can be estimated, we\nrecognize a reduction to revenue at the time the related revenue is recognized; otherwise, we recognize such reduction to revenue at the later of when: i) the\nrelated revenue transaction occurs; or ii) the program is offered. For transactions where we reimburse a customer for a portion of the customer’s cost to perform\nspecific product advertising or marketing and promotional activities, such amounts are recognized as a reduction to revenue unless they qualify for expense\nrecognition.\nWe also provide limited product return rights to certain OEMs and to most distribution customers. These return rights are generally limited to a contractual\npercentage of the customer’s prior quarter shipments, although, from time to time we may approve additional product returns beyond the contractual\narrangements based on the applicable facts and circumstances. In order to estimate adjustments to revenue to account for these returns, including product\nrestocking rights provided to distributor and OEM customers, we utilize relevant, trended actual historical product return rate information gathered, adjusted for\nactual known information or events, as applicable.\nOverall, our estimates of adjustments to contract price due to variable consideration under our contracts with OEM and distributor customers, based on our\nassumptions and include adjustments, if any, for known events, have been materially consistent with actual results; however, these estimates are subject to\nmanagement’s judgment and actual provisions could be different from our estimates and current provisions, resulting in future adjustments to our revenue and\noperating results.\n42\n\n\nTable of Contents\nInventory Valuation. We value inventory at standard cost, adjusted to approximate the lower of actual cost or estimated net realizable value using assumptions\nabout future demand and market conditions.

In determining excess or obsolescence reserves for products, we consider assumptions such as\nchanges in business and economic conditions, other-than-temporary decreases in demand for our products, and changes in technology or customer\nrequirements. In determining the lower of cost or net realizable value reserves, we consider assumptions such as recent historical sales activity and selling\nprices, as well as estimates of future selling prices. If in any period we anticipate a change in assumptions such as future demand or market conditions to be\nless favorable than our previous estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales, resulting in a negative\nimpact to our gross margin in that period.

We allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired\nbased on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is\nrecorded as goodwill. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets.\nSignificant estimates in valuing developed technology, in-process research and development, customer relationships and other identifiable intangible assets\ninclude, but are not limited to, expected future revenue growth rates and margins, future changes in technology, time to recreate customer relationships, useful\nlives, and discount rates.\nManagement's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a\nresult, actual results may differ from estimates. Allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable assets and liabilities affects our amortization expense, as\nacquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the useful life, whereas any indefinite lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortized.\nDuring the measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.\nGoodwill. Goodwill is the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred over the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection\nwith business combinations.

The fair values of our reporting units are estimated using a combination of the income approach, which requires estimating the present value of expected\nfuture cash flows of a reporting unit, and the market approach, which uses financial ratios of comparable companies to arrive at an estimated value for the\nreporting unit. Significant estimates and assumptions used in the income approach include assessments of macroeconomic conditions, growth rates of our\nreporting units in the near- and long-term, expectations of our ability to execute on our roadmap and projections, and the discount rate applied to cash flows.\nSignificant estimates used in the market approach include the identification of comparable companies for each reporting unit, the determination of an\nappropriate control premium that a market participant would apply to a reporting unit, and the determination of appropriate multiples to apply to a reporting unit\nbased on adjustments and consideration of specific attributes of that reporting unit.\n43\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe most significant assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair values of our reporting units are the sales and earnings growth rates\n(including long-term growth rates) and discount rates. Long-term growth rates are dependent on overall market growth rates, the competitive environment and\ninflation. As a result, long-term growth rates could be adversely impacted by a sustained deceleration in category growth or an increased competitive\nenvironment. Discount rates, which are consistent with a weighted average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by a market participant, are based upon\nindustry required rates of return, including consideration of both debt and equity components of the capital structure. Our discount rates may be impacted by\nadverse changes in the macroeconomic environment, prolonged and continuing inflationary pressures, volatility in the equity and debt markets and other factors\nthat otherwise create or exacerbate risks in our reporting units. Changes in operating plans or adverse changes in the business or in the macroeconomic\nenvironment in the future could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair values and could result in a decline in fair value that would trigger future\nimpairment charges of our reporting units’ goodwill. Based on our annual impairment testing, the fair values of all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying\nvalues.\nLong-Lived and Intangible Assets. Long-lived and intangible assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment if indicators of potential impairment exist\nand at least annually for indefinite-lived intangible assets. Impairment indicators are reviewed on a quarterly basis. Assets are grouped and evaluated for\nimpairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. When indi",

In the event such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the recorded value of the assets, the\nassets are written down to their estimated fair values based on the expected discounted future cash flows attributable to the asset group or based on\nappraisals. Factors affecting impairment of assets held for use include the ability of the specific assets to generate separately identifiable positive cash flows.\nWhen assets are removed from operations and held for sale, we estimate impairment losses as the excess of the carrying value of the assets over their fair\nvalue. Market conditions are among the factors affecting impairment of assets held for sale. Changes in any of these factors could necessitate impairment\nrecognition in future periods for assets held for use or assets held for sale.\nIncome Taxes. In determining taxable income for financial statement reporting purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and\njudgments are applied in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets which arise from temporary\ndifferences between the recognition of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement reporting purposes.\nWe regularly assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. Unless recovery is considered more-likely-than-not (a probability level\nof more than 50%), we will record a charge to income tax expense in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not\nultimately be recoverable or maintain the valuation allowance recorded in prior periods. When considering all available evidence, if we determine it is more-\nlikely-than-not we will realize our deferred tax assets, we will reverse some or all of the existing valuation allowance, which would result in a credit to income tax\nexpense and the establishment of an asset in the period of reversal.\nIn determining the need to establish or maintain a valuation allowance, we consider the four sources of jurisdictional taxable income: (i) carryback of net\noperating losses to prior years; (ii) future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences; (iii) viable and prudent tax planning strategies; and (iv) future\ntaxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards.\nThrough the end of 2022, we continue to maintain a valuation allowance of approximately $2.1 billion for certain federal, state, and foreign tax attributes. The\nfederal valuation allowance maintained is due to limitations, under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 or 383, separate return loss year rules, or dual\nconsolidated loss rules. Certain state and foreign valuation allowances are maintained due to a lack of sufficient sources of future taxable income.\nIn addition, the c",

The change was primarily due to a $62 million decrease in the\nfair value of equity investments in 2022 compared to an increase in fair value of $56 million from equity investments in 2021, partially offset by $65 million of\ninterest income driven mainly by rising interest rates in 2022 compared to losses from conversion of our convertible debt of $7 million in 2021.\nIncome Tax Provision (Benefit)\nWe recorded an income tax benefit of $122 million in 2022 and an income tax provision of $513 million in 2021, representing effective tax rates of (10%) and\n14%, respectively. The reduction in income tax expense in 2022 was primarily due to the lower pre-tax income coupled with a $261 million foreign-derived\nintangible income tax benefit and $241 million of research and development tax credits.\nThrough the end of fiscal year 2022, we continued to maintain a valuation allowance of approximately $2.1 billion for certain federal, state, and foreign tax\nattributes.

These securities are\nsubject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase.

Our portfolio includes investments in marketable debt securities with\nactive secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity. We are averse to principal loss and strive to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk\nand market risk.\nWe actively monitor market conditions and developments specific to the securities and security classes in which we invest.

Fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 ended on December 31,\n2022, December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020, respectively. Fiscal 2022 consisted of 53 weeks, and fiscal 2021 and 2020 each consisted of 52 weeks.\nPrinciples of Consolidation.  The consolidated financial statements include the Company’s accounts and those of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Upon\nconsolidation, all inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated.\nReclassification. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.\nUse of Estimates. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requires\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of commitments and contingencies at\nthe date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results are likely to differ from\nthose estimates, and such differences may be material to the financial statements. Areas where management uses subjective judgment include, but are not\nlimited to, revenue allowances, inventory valuation, valuation of goodwill and long-lived and intangible assets, and income taxes.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration which the\nCompany expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Sales, value-added, and other taxes collected concurrently with the provision of goods or\nservices are excluded from revenue. Shipping and handling costs associated with product sales are included in cost of sales. Substantially all the Company’s\nrevenue is derived from product sales, representing a single performance obligation.\nCustomers are generally required to pay for products and services within the Company’s standard contractual terms, which are typically net 30 to 60 days. The\nCompany has determined that it does not have significant financing components in its contracts with customers.\nNon-custom products\nThe Company transf",

Non-custom product arrangements generally comprise a single\nperformance obligation. Certain OEMs may be entitled to rights of return and rebates under OEM agreements. The Company also sells to distributors under\nterms allowing the majority of distributors certain rights of return and price protection on unsold merchandise held by them. The Company estimates the amount\nof variable consideration under OEM and distributor arrangements and, accordingly, records a provision for product returns, allowances for price protection and\nrebates based on actual historical experience and any known events.\n57\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe Company offers incentive programs to certain customers, including cooperative advertising, marketing promotions, volume-based incentives and special\npricing arrangements. Where funds provided for such programs can be estimated, the Company recognizes a reduction to revenue at the time the related\nrevenue is recognized; otherwise, the Company recognizes such reduction to revenue at the later of when: i) the related revenue transaction occurs; or ii) the\nprogram is offered. For transactions where the Company reimburses a customer for a portion of the customer’s cost to perform specific product advertising or\nmarketing and promotional activities, such amounts are recognized as a reduction to revenue unless they qualify for expense recognition.\nConstraints of variable consideration have not been material.\nCustom products\nCustom products which are associated with the Company’s Gaming segment (semi-custom products), sold under non-cancellable purchases orders, for which\nthe Company has an enforceable right to payment, and which have no alternative use to the Company at contract inception, are recognized as revenue, over\nthe time of production of the products by the Company. The Company utilizes a cost-based input method, calculated as cost incurred plus estimated margin, to\ndetermine the amount of revenue to recognize for in-process, but incomplete, customer orders at a reporting date. The Company believes that a cost-based\ninput method is the most appropriate manner to measure how the Company satisfies its performance obligations to customers because the effort and costs\nincurred best depict the Company’s satisfaction of its performance obligation.\nSales of semi-custom products are not subject to a right of return. Custom products arrangements generally involve a single performance obligation.

A licensing component is distinct if it is both (i) capable of being distinct and (ii) distinct in the context of the arrangement. If the\nlicense is not distinct, it is combined with the development services as a single performance obligation and recognized over time. If the license is distinct,\nrevenue is recognized at a point in time when the customer has the ability to benefit from the license.\nFrom time to time, the Company may enter into arrangements with customers that solely involve the sale or licensing of its patents or IP. Generally, there are no\nperformance obligations beyond transferring the designated license to the Company’s patents or IP. Accordingly, revenue is recognized at a point in time when\nthe customer has the ability to benefit from the license.\nThere are no variable consideration estimates associated with either combined development and IP arrangements or for standalone arrangements involving\neither the sale or licensing of IP.\nInventories\nThe Company values inventory at standard cost, adjusted to approximate the lower of actual cost or estimated net realizable value using assumptions about\nfuture demand and market conditions. In determining excess or obsolescence reserves for its products, the Company considers assumptions such as changes\nin business and economic conditions, other-than-temporary decreases in demand for its products, and changes in technology or customer requirements. In\ndetermining the lower of cost or net realizable value reserves, the Company considers assumptions such as recent historical sales activity and selling prices, as\nwell as estimates of future selling prices.

When determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially\nwith respect to intangible assets. Critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, expected future revenue growth rates and\nmargins, future changes in technology, time to recreate customer relationships, useful lives, and discount rates. Fair value estimates are based on the\nassumptions that management believes a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability. These estimates are inherently uncertain and, therefore,\nactual results may differ from the estimates made. As a result, during the measurement period of up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may\nrecord adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or\nfinal determination of the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded in the\nConsolidated Statements of Operations.\nGoodwill\nThe Company performs its goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year and, if certain events or circumstances indicate that\nan impairment loss may have been incurred, on a more frequent basis. The analysis may include both qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the\nlikelihood of an impairment.\nThe Company has the option to first perform qualitative testing to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying\namount. Qualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, share price trends and market capitalization and\nCompany-specific events. If the Company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, the Company\ndoes not proceed to perform a quantitative impairment test.\nIf the Company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value or elects to bypass the qualitative test, a\nquantitative goodwill impairment test will be performed by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. The Company’s quantitative\nimpairment analysis uses a combination of the income approach, which requires estimates of the present value of expected future cash flows of a reporting\nunit, and the market approach, which uses financial ratios of comparable companies to arrive at an estimated value for the reporting units. Significant estimates\nand assumptions used in the income approach include assessments of macroeconomic conditions, growth rates of reporting units in the near- and long-term,\nexpectations of the Company’s ability to execute on roadmaps and projections, and the discount rate applied to cash flows.

Significant estimates used in the\nmarket approach include the identification of comparable companies for each reporting unit, and the determination of the appropriate multiples to apply to a\nreporting unit based on adjustments and consideration of specific attributes of that reporting unit. If a reporting unit’s fair value is determined to be less than its\ncarrying value, a goodwill impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying value, not to exceed\nthe total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nLong-Lived and Intangible Assets\nLong-lived and intangible assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment if indicators of potential impairment exist and at least annually for indefinite-\nlived intangible assets. Impairment indicators are reviewed on a quarterly basis. Assets are grouped and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level of\nidentifiable cash flows.\nWhen indicators of impairment exist and assets are held for use, the Company estimates future undiscounted cash flows attributable to the related asset\ngroups. In the event such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the recorded value of the assets, the assets are written down to their estimated\nfair values based on the expected discounted future cash flows attributable to the asset group or based on appraisals. Factors affecting impairment of assets\nheld for use include the ability of the specific assets to generate separately identifiable positive cash flows.\nWhen assets are removed from operations and held for sale, the Company estimates impairment losses as the excess of the carrying value of the assets over\ntheir fair value. Market conditions are among the factors affecting impairment of assets held for sale. Changes in any of these factors could necessitate\nimpairment recognition in future periods for assets held for use or assets held for sale.\n59\n\n\nTable of Contents\nCash Equivalents\nCash equivalents consist of financial instruments that are readily convertible into cash and have original maturities of three months or less at the time of\npurchase.\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable are primarily comprised of trade receivables presented net of rebates, price protection and an allowance for credit loss. Accounts\nreceivable also include unbilled receivables, which primarily represent work completed on development services recognized as revenue but not yet invoiced to\ncustomers and semi-custom products under non-cancellable purchase orders that have no alternative use to the Company at contract inception, for which\nrevenue has been recognized but not yet invoiced to customers.

The Company does not believe the receivable balance from its customers represents a significant credit\nrisk.\nInvestments\nAvailable for Sale Debt Securities. The Company classifies its investments in debt securities at the date of acquisition as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale\ndebt securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a\ncomponent of stockholders’ equity. If an available-for-sale debt security’s fair value is less than its amortized cost basis, then the Company evaluates whether\nthe decline is the result of a credit loss, in which case an impairment is recorded through an allowance for credit losses. Unrealized gains and losses not\nattributable to credit losses are included, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders’ equity. Classification of\navailable-for-sale debt securities as current or non-current is based on the Company’s intent and belief in its ability to sell these securities and use the proceeds\nfrom sale in operations within 12 months.\nNon-marketable Securities. The Company’s investments in non-marketable securities of privately-held companies are accounted for under the measurement\nalternative, defined as cost, less impairments, adjusted for subsequent observable price changes and are periodically assessed for impairment when events or\ncircumstances indicate that a decline in value may have occurred. The Company's periodic assessment of impairment is made by considering available\nevidence, including the investee’s general market and industry conditions and product development status. The Company also assesses the investee’s ability to\nmeet business milestones, its financial condition, and near-term prospects, including the rate at which the investee is using its cash, the investee’s need for\npossible additional funding at a lower valuation and any bona fide offer to purchase the investee.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company’s financial instruments are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, except for non-marketable equity investments in privately-\nheld companies, which are generally accounted for under the measurement alternative.\nFair Value Hierarchy\nThe fair value framework requires the categorization of assets and liabilities into three levels based upon the assumptions (inputs) used to price the assets or\nliabilities.

Depreciation and amortization are provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of one to 15 years\nfor equipment, 34 to 44 years for buildings, and leasehold improvements are measured by the shorter of the remaining terms of the leases or the estimated\nuseful economic lives of the improvements.\nLeases\nOperating and finance leases are recorded as right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities on the Company’s balance sheet. ROU assets represent the\nCompany’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the\nlease. Operating and finance lease ROU assets and liabilities are initially recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. In\ndetermining the present value of lease payments, the Company uses the implicit interest rate if readily determinable. When the implicit interest rate is not\nreadily determinable, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate, which is based on its collateralized borrowing capabilities over a similar term of the\nlease payments. The Company utilizes the consolidated group incremental borrowing rate for all leases as the Company has centralized treasury operations.\nLease expense for operating lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company has elected the accounting policy to not\nrecognize ROU assets and lease liabilities that arise from short-term (12 months or less) leases for any class of underlying asset.

As a result of the acquisition, the Company recorded\n$27.3 billion of identified intangible assets (refer to Note 5 - Business Combinations), of which $16.9 billion are related to foreign operations which will be\namortized to income from operations over the assets’ estimated useful lives, but for which the Company will not receive a tax deduction under GI",

This\naccounting policy change resulted in the recording of $857 million of deferred tax liabilities in connection with the Xilinx acquisition as disclosed in Note 14 -\nIncome Taxes. In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2022, it resulted in a decrease in the income tax provision with a corresponding increase to net\nincome of $296 million and an increase in basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.19, as compared to the computation under the previous accounting policy.\nThis accounting policy change had no material impact on the Company’s historical consolidated financial statements.\n62\n\n\nTable of Contents\nAccrued Interest on Unrecognized Tax Benefits. Prior to 2022, the Company reported any interest expense related to unrecognized tax benefits as a\ncomponent of Interest expense and reported any related penalties as a component of Income tax provision (benefit). In 2022, the Company elected to change\nits method of accounting for tax interest expense from Interest expense to the Income tax provision (benefit) line in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThis change in classification is considered preferable as it i) better aligns classification of tax interest with the substance of the underlying tax positions, which\nare managed inclusive of interest, ii) allows for greater visibility to the cost of the Company’s debt and other financing activities, and iii) better aligns with\ncommon industry practice and provides increased comparability. This accounting policy change resulted in a decrease in Interest expense and corresponding\nincrease to i) Income before income taxes and equity income and ii) Income tax provision (benefit) as reported on the Consolidated Statements of Operations of\n$11 million in 2022. This accounting policy change had an immaterial effect on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in 2021 and 2020, and the Company\ndid not revise its previously issued consolidated financial statements for these fiscal years.

The capitalization resulted in an increase in 2022 taxable income which also increased the income eligible for the FDII tax\nbenefit.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated\nfinancial statements, the Company adjusts the inventory carrying value to the lower of actual cost or the estimated net realizable\nvalue after completing ongoing reviews of on-hand inventory quantities exceeding forecasted demand and by considering recent\nhistorical activity as well as anticipated demand. Auditing management’s inventory carrying value adjustments involved\nsignificant judgment because the estimates are based on several factors that are affected by market, industry, and competitive\nconditions outside the Company's control. In estimating inventory carrying value adjustments, management developed\nassumptions such as forecasts of future sales quantities and the selling prices, which are sensitive to the competitiveness of\nproduct offerings, customer requirements, and product life cycles.

(“Xilinx”) for consideration of $48.8 billion, as\ndisclosed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination.\nAuditing the Company's accounting for its acquisition of Xilinx was complex due to the significant estimation uncertainty in the\nCompany’s determination of the fair value of certain identified intangible assets, principally consisting of developed technology\nand customer relationships. The significant estimation uncertainty was primarily due to the sensitivity of the respective fair values\nto underlying assumptions about the future performance of the acquired business. The Company used a discounted cash flow\nmodel to measure the developed technology and customer relationship intangible assets. The significant assumptions used to\nestimate the value of these intangible assets included certain assumptions that form the basis of the forecasted results,\nspecifically, revenue growth rates, technology migration curves, and time to recreate customer relationships. These significant\nassumptions are forward looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions.\nHow We Addressed the\nMatter in Our Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s\naccounting for the acquisition.

A company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect\nthe transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being\nmade only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or\ntimely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n93\n\n\nTable of Contents\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance\nwith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nSan Jose, California\nFebruary 27, 2023\n94\n\n\nTable of Contents\nITEM 9.

However, we can infer some factors that might affect AMD's operating margin from the information given:\n\n1. **Litigation costs**: The document mentions several lawsuits and patent infringement complaints against AMD, including those from Polaris, Monterey Research, and Analog Devices. While the Company believes that the potential liability of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations, there might be some litigation costs incurred in FY22, which could affect the operating margin.\n\n2. **License agreement with Monterey Research**: The Company entered into an agreement with Monterey Research, which provided a license to the Monterey Research patents. This agreement did not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations. However, the terms of the agreement might have some impact on AMD's operating margin.\n\n3. **Technology collaborations with Analog Devices**:\n   Citation: None. \n\nHowever, I can provide a general statement that might be relevant:\n\nBased on the provided document excerpt, there is no direct information about AMD's operating margin in FY22.\n\n### Chunk # 115\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`115`):\n   Answer: None. \n\nThe provided document excerpt does not explicitly mention AMD's FY22 financial results, and therefore, it is not possible to determine the factors affecting the company's operating margin in FY22.\n   Explanation: Based on the provided document excerpt, I will analyze the factors affecting AMD's operating margin in FY22. However, the document does not explicitly mention AMD's FY22 financial results. Nevertheless, I can identify some factors that might affect the company's operating margin:\n\n1. **Future Link Systems Litigation**: The agreement with Future Link Systems, LLC, which provided a license to the Future Link patents, did not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations. This suggests that the litigation costs might not have significantly impacted the company's operating margin.\n2. **Environmental Matters**: The Company has computed and recorded an estimated environmental liability of approximately $3.9 million. This might have affected the company's operating margin, but the document does not provide information on how this liability was accounted for in the financial statements.\n\nSince the document does not provide explicit information on AMD's FY22 financial results, I will not be able to provide a detailed analysis of the\n   Citation: None. \n\nHowever, I can provide a citation that supports the fact that the Future Link Systems Litigation did not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations:\n\n\"The agreement did not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations.\"\n\n### Chunk # 116\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`116`):\n   Answer: None.\n\nThe document excerpt does not provide sufficient information to determine the factors affecting AMD's operating margin in FY22.\n   Explanation: To identify and summarize factors affecting AMD's operating margin in FY22, I will analyze the provided document excerpt, focusing on revenue, cost of goods sold, operating expenses, and any significant one-time charges or gains.\n\nThe document excerpt does not directly mention AMD's operating margin or provide detailed information on revenue, cost of goods sold, and operating expenses for FY22. However, it does mention the following relevant points:\n\n1. The Company believes that the amount or range of reasonably possible loss, if any, from various legal matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. This implies that there are no significant one-time charges or gains related to legal matters that would affect the operating margin.\n2.

What information we have gathered\n2. Whether it is sufficient to answer the question\n3. If not sufficient, what specific information is missing\n4. If sufficient, how we would calculate or derive the answer\n5. If there are conflicting answers:\n--> Use citations to select the correct answer if there are conflicting answers.\n\nBe brief and concise. No need for structured output - just think through the steps. You MUST respond in markdown format (for $ signs make sure to use escape character \\ before the $ sign).\n",
      "output": "### Analysis\n\n1. **Information Gathered**: \n   - We have identified several factors that could potentially affect AMD's operating margin in FY22. These include revenue growth in specific segments, increased costs due to acquisitions, market conditions, changes in operating income, increased operating expenses, foreign currency fluctuations, and inventory write-downs.\n   - Specific financial figures were mentioned, such as a 44% increase in net revenue to $23.6 billion, a decrease in gross margin from 48% to 45% due to amortization of intangible assets, and increased operating expenses due to acquisitions.\n   - The impact of acquisitions like Xilinx and Pensando on revenue and expenses was noted, along with increased R&D and marketing expenses.\n\n2. **Sufficiency of Information**:\n   - The information is somewhat fragmented and lacks a direct calculation or statement of the operating margin change. While we have qualitative factors, the quantitative impact on the operating margin is not fully detailed.\n   - We have some financial figures, but they are not comprehensive enough to calculate the exact change in operating margin.\n\n3. **Missing Information**:\n   - A direct calculation or statement of the operating margin change is missing.\n   - Detailed breakdowns of cost of goods sold, specific operating expenses, and any significant one-time charges or gains are not fully provided.\n   - A clear comparison of operating income or margin from FY21 to FY22 would be helpful.\n\n4. **Calculation/Derivation**:\n   - If we had the complete financial statements, we could calculate the operating margin by using the formula: \\(\\text{Operating Margin} = \\frac{\\text{Operating Income}}{\\text{Revenue}} \\times 100\\%\\).\n   - We would need the operating income for FY22 and FY21 to determine the change in operating margin.\n\n5. **Conflicting Answers**:\n   - There are no direct conflicting answers, but the lack of comprehensive data makes it difficult to definitively answer the question.\n   - Citations provided in the outputs do not directly resolve the question but offer insights into specific factors affecting the margin.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe information gathered provides a qualitative understanding of the factors affecting AMD's operating margin in FY22, but it is insufficient for a precise quantitative analysis. To fully answer the question, we would need more detailed financial data, including a direct comparison of operating income and margin between FY21 and FY22."

These forward-\nlooking statements are based on current expectations and beliefs and involve numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ\nmaterially from expectations. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date hereof or as of the dates indicated in the statements and should not\nbe relied upon as predictions of future events, as we cannot assure you that the events or circumstances reflected in these statements will be achieved or will\noccur. You can identify forward-looking statements by the use of forward-looking terminology including “believes,” “expects,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “seeks,”\n“intends,” “plans,” “pro forma,” “estimates,” “anticipates,” or the negative of these words and phrases, other variations of these words and phrases or\ncomparable terminology. The forward-looking statements relate to, among other things: possible impact of future accounting rules on AMD’s consolidated\nfinancial statements; demand for AMD’s products; the growth, change and competitive landscape of the markets in which AMD participates; international sales\nwill continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future; that AMD’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment balances together\nwith the availability under that certain revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Agreement) made available to AMD and certain of its subsidiaries, our\ncommercial paper program, and our cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund AMD’s operations including capital expenditures and purchase\ncommitments over the next 12 months and beyond; AMD’s ability to obtain sufficient external financing on favorable terms, or at all; AMD’s expectation that\nbased on management’s current knowledge, the potential liability related to AMD’s current litigation will not have a material adverse effect on its financial\nposition, results of operation or cash flows; anticipated ongoing and increased costs related to enhancing and implementing information security controls; all\nunbilled accounts receivables are expected to be billed and collected within 12 months; revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations that are\nunsatisfied which will be recognized in the next 12 months; and a small number of customers will continue to account for a substantial part of AMD’s revenue in\nthe future.

Including United States and foreign matters, we have approximately 19,800 patent matters worldwide\nconsisting of approximately 13,200 issued patents and 6,600 patent applications pending. We expect to file future patent applications in both the United States\nand abroad on significant inventions, as we deem appropriate. We do not believe that any individual patent, or the expiration of any patent, is or would be\nmaterial to our business. As is typical in the semiconductor industry, we have numerous cross-licensing and technology exchange agreements with other\ncompanies under which we both transfer and receive technology and intellectual property rights. We have acquired various licenses from external parties to\ncertain technologies that are implemented in our products, including our IP cores and devices. These licenses support our continuing ability to make and sell\nour products. We have also acquired licenses to certain proprietary software, open-source software, and related technologies, such as compilers, for our design\ntools. Continued use of such software and technology is important to the operation of the design tools upon which our customers depend.\nBacklog\nSales are made primarily pursuant to purchase orders for current delivery or agreements covering purchases over a period of time. Although such orders or\nagreements may provide visibility into future quarters, they may not necessarily be indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period as some of these orders\nor agreements may be revised or canceled without penalty. With respect to our semi-custom SoC products our orders and agreements are more stringent\nresulting in meaningful backlog for the coming quarter.\nSeasonality\nOur operating results tend to vary seasonally. Historically, our net revenue has been generally higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the\nyear, although market conditions and product transitions could impact these trends.\nHuman Capital\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 25,000 employees in our global workforce.

The chemicals released into the groundwater were\ncommonly used in the semiconductor industry in the United States in the wafer fabrication process prior to 1979.\nIn 1991, we received Final Site Clean-up Requirements Orders from the California Regional Water Quality Control Board relating to the three sites. We have\nentered into settlement agreements with other responsible parties on two of the orders. During the term of such agreements, other parties have agreed to\nassume most of the foreseeable costs as well as the primary role in conducting remediation activities under the orders. We remain responsible for additional\ncosts beyond the scope of the agreements as well as all remaining costs in the event that the other parties do not fulfill their obligations under the settlement\nagreements.\nTo address anticipated future remediation costs under the orders, we have computed and recorded an estimated environmental liability of approximately $3.9\nmillion and have not recorded any potential insurance recoveries in determining the estimated costs of the cleanup.

Intel’s market share, margins and significant financial resources\nenable it to market its products aggressively, to target our customers and our channel partners with special incentives and to influence customers who do\nbusiness with us. These aggressive activities have in the past resulted in lower unit sales and a lower average selling price for many of our products and\nadversely affected our margins and profitability.\nIntel exerts substantial influence over computer manufacturers and their channels of distribution through various brand and other marketing programs. As a\nresult of Intel’s position in the microprocessor market, Intel has been able to control x86 microprocessor and computer system standards and benchmarks and\nto dictate the type of products the microprocessor market requires of us. Intel also dominates the computer system platform, which includes core logic chipsets,\ngraphics chips, networking devices (wired and wireless), non-volatile storage and other components necessary to assemble a computer system. Additionally,\nIntel is able to drive de facto standards and specifications for x86 microprocessors that could cause us and other companies to have delayed access to such\nstandards.\nAs long as Intel remains in this dominant position, we may be materially adversely affected by Intel’s business practices, including rebating and allocation\nstrategies and pricing actions, designed to limit our market share and margins; product mix and introduction schedules; product bundling, marketing and\nmerchandising strategies; exclusivity payments to its current and potential customers, retailers and channel partners; de facto control over industry standards,\nand heavy influence on PC manufacturers and other PC industry participants, including motherboard, memory, chipset and basic input/output system (BIOS)\nsuppliers and software companies as well as the graphics interface for Intel platforms; and marketing and advertising expenditures in support of positioning the\nIntel brand over the brand of its original equipment manufacturer (OEM) customers and retailers.\nIntel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on marketing and research and\ndevelopment than we do.

To the extent Intel manufactures a significantly larger portion of its microprocessor products using more advanced process technologies,\nor introduces competitive new products into the market before we do, we may be more vulnerable to Intel’s aggressive marketing and pricing strategies for\nmicroprocessor products.\nIntel could also take actions that place our discrete graphics processing units (GPUs) at a competitive disadvantage, including giving one or more of our\ncompetitors in the graphics market, such as NVIDIA Corporation, preferential access to its proprietary graphics interface or other useful information or restricting\naccess to external companies. Also, Intel has developed and released their own high-end discrete GPUs, including gaming focused discrete GPUs. We also\ncompete with Intel in field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and Adaptive SoC products. Intel’s position in the microprocessor, and integrated graphics\nchipset markets, its introduction of competitive new products, its existing relationships with top-tier OEMs, and its aggressive marketing and pricing strategies\ncould result in lower unit sales and lower average selling prices for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nGlobal economic and market uncertainty may adversely impact our business and operating results.\nWe experienced a decline in our Client segment revenue as a result of weak PC market macroeconomic conditions and inventory correction actions across the\nPC supply chain in the second half of 2022.

The adoption of a new\nERP system is a major undertaking and poses several challenges, both financially and from a management and personnel perspective. Costs and risks\ninherent in the conversion to our upgraded and new system may include disruptions to business continuity, difficulty in maintaining effective internal controls,\nadministrative and technical problems, interruptions or delays in sales processes, expenditure overruns, and data migration issues. If we do not properly\naddress or mitigate these issues it could result in increased costs and the diversion of management’s attention and resources, negatively impacting our\noperating results and ability to effectively manage our business. Moreover, once our ERP system is upgraded, it may not operate as we expect it to\n24\n\n\nTable of Contents\nand cause disruption to our operations. There are no assurances that our new ERP system will be successfully implemented and the failure to do so could have\na material adverse effect on our business.\nUncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of our products could materially adversely affect us.\nWe typically sell our products pursuant to individual purchase orders. We generally do not have long-term supply arrangements with our customers or minimum\npurchase requirements except that orders generally must be for standard pack quantities. Generally, our customers may cancel orders for standard products\nmore than 30 days prior to shipment without incurring significant fees. We base our inventory levels in part on customers’ estimates of demand for their\nproducts, which may not accurately predict the quantity or type of our products that our customers will want in the future or ultimately end up purchasing. Our\nability to forecast demand is even further complicated when our products are sold indirectly through downstream channel distributors and customers, as our\nforecasts for demand are then based on estimates provided by multiple parties throughout the downstream channel. For instance, we have experienced and\ncontinue to experience increased demand for our products. To the extent we fail to forecast demand and product mix accurately or are unable to increase\nproduction or secure sufficient capacity and there is a mismatch between supply and demand for our products, it could limit our ability to meet customer\ndemand and have a material adverse effect on our business. Many of our markets are characterized by short product lifecycles, which can lead to rapid\nobsolescence and price erosion. In addition, our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason.

In connection with the Xilinx and Pensando acquisitions, we recorded significant goodwill and other intangible assets on\nour consolidated balance sheet.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are tested for impairment at least annually, and all tangible and intangible assets including goodwill will be\ntested for impairment when certain indicators are present. If, in the future, we determine that tangible or intangible assets, including goodwill, are impaired, we\nwould record an impairment charge at that time. Impairment testing of goodwill requires significant use of judgment and assumptions, particularly as it relates to\nthe determination of fair value. Subsequent to our annual goodwill impairment analysis, we monitor for any events or changes in circumstances, such as\nsignificant adverse changes in business climate or operating results, changes in management’s business strategy, an inability to successfully introduce new\nproducts in the marketplace, an inability to successfully achieve internal forecasts or significant declines in our stock price, which may represent an indicator of\nimpairment.

In February 2022, we completed our strategic\nacquisition of Xilinx, Inc. (Xilinx) which expanded our technology and product portfolio to include adaptable hardware platforms that enable hardware\nacceleration and rapid innovation across a variety of technologies and established AMD in multiple embedded markets where we have traditionally not had a\nsignificant presence. We now offer Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), Adaptive SoCs, and Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform (ACAP) products.\nWith the acquisition of Xilinx, we have access to a new set of markets and customers, further strengthening and diversifying our business model. In May 2022,\nwe expanded our data center solutions capabilities with the acquisition of Pensando Systems, Inc. (Pensando). We now offer high-performance data\nprocessing units (DPUs) and a software stack that complements our existing products. With the Xilinx and Pensando acquisitions, we are well positioned to\nprovide the industry’s broadest set of leadership compute engines and accelerators to help enable best performance, security, flexibility and total cost of\nownership for leading-edge data centers.\nOur 2022 financial results reflect the strength of our diversified business model despite the challenging PC market conditions in the second half of 2022. Net\nrevenue for 2022 was $23.6 billion, an increase of 44% compared to 2021 net revenue of $16.4 billion. The increase in net revenue was driven by a 64%\nincrease in Data Center segment revenue primarily due to higher sales of our EPYC™ server processors, a 21% increase in Gaming segment revenue\nprimarily due to higher semi-custom product sales, and a significant increase in Embedded segment revenue from the prior year period driven by the inclusion\nof Xilinx embedded product sales. This growth was partially offset by a 10% decrease in Client segment revenue primarily due to lower processor shipments\ndriven by a weak PC market and significant inventory correction actions across the PC supply chain. Gross margin, as a percentage of net revenue for 2022,\nwas 45%, compared to 48% in 2021. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition.\nOperating income for 2022 was $1.3 billion compared to operating income of $3.6 billion for 2021. The decrease in operating income was primarily driven by\namortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition. Net income for 2022 was $1.3 billion compared to $3.2 billion in the prior year. The\ndecrease in net income was primarily driven by lower operating income.\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2022 were $5.9 billion, compared to $3.6 billion at the end of 2021.

The 3.924% Notes and the 4.393% Notes are senior unsecured\nobligations.\n40\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWe also entered into a revolving credit agreement in June 2022. The agreement provides for a five-year unsecured revolving credit facility in the aggregate\nprincipal amount of $3.0 billion. There were no funds drawn from this facility during the year ended December 31, 2022. In November 2022, we established a\nnew commercial paper program, under which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum principal amount outstanding at any time of\n$3.0 billion with a maturity of up to 397 days from the date of issue. The commercial paper will be sold at a discount from par or, alternatively, will be sold at par\nand bear interest at rates that will vary based on market conditions at the time of issuance. As of December  31, 2022, we had no commercial paper\noutstanding.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, we returned a total of $3.7 billion to shareholders through the repurchase of 36.3 million shares of\ncommon stock under our stock repurchase program. As of December 31, 2022, $6.5 billion remained available for future stock repurchases under this program.\nThe repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any common stock, has no termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.\nWe continued executing our product technology roadmap by delivering a number of new leadership products and technologies during 2022.

The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make\nestimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis, including\nthose related to our revenue, inventories, business combination, goodwill, long-lived and intangible assets, and income taxes. We base our estimates on\nhistorical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for\nmaking judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Although actual results have historically been reasonably consistent with management’s\nexpectations, the actual results may differ from these estimates or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions.\nManagement believes the following critical accounting estimates are the most significant to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most\ndifficult, subjective and complex judgments.\nRevenue Allowances.  Revenue contracts with our customers include variable amounts which we evaluate under ASC 606-10-32-8 through 14 in order to\ndetermine the net amount of consideration to which we are entitled and which we recognize as revenue. We determine the net amount of consideration to\nwhich we are entitled by estimating the most likely amount of consideration we expect to receive from the customer after adjustments to the contract price for\nrights of return and rebates to our original equipment manufacturers (OEM) customers and rights of return, rebates and price protection on unsold merchandise\nto our distributor customers.\nWe base our determination of necessary adjustments to the contract price by reference to actual historical activity and experience, including actual historical\nreturns, rebates and credits issued to OEM and distributor customers adjusted, as applicable, to include adjustments, if any, for known events or current\neconomic conditions, or both.\nOur estimates of necessary adjustments for distributor price incentives and price protection on unsold products held by distributors are based on actual\nhistorical incentives provided to distributor customers and known future price movements based on our internal and external market data analysis.\nOur estimates of necessary adjustments for OEM price incentives utilize, in addition to known pricing agreements, actual historical rebate attainment rates and\nestimates of future OEM rebate program attainment based on internal and external market data analysis.\nWe offer incent",

Where funds provided for such programs can be estimated, we\nrecognize a reduction to revenue at the time the related revenue is recognized; otherwise, we recognize such reduction to revenue at the later of when: i) the\nrelated revenue transaction occurs; or ii) the program is offered. For transactions where we reimburse a customer for a portion of the customer’s cost to perform\nspecific product advertising or marketing and promotional activities, such amounts are recognized as a reduction to revenue unless they qualify for expense\nrecognition.\nWe also provide limited product return rights to certain OEMs and to most distribution customers. These return rights are generally limited to a contractual\npercentage of the customer’s prior quarter shipments, although, from time to time we may approve additional product returns beyond the contractual\narrangements based on the applicable facts and circumstances. In order to estimate adjustments to revenue to account for these returns, including product\nrestocking rights provided to distributor and OEM customers, we utilize relevant, trended actual historical product return rate information gathered, adjusted for\nactual known information or events, as applicable.\nOverall, our estimates of adjustments to contract price due to variable consideration under our contracts with OEM and distributor customers, based on our\nassumptions and include adjustments, if any, for known events, have been materially consistent with actual results; however, these estimates are subject to\nmanagement’s judgment and actual provisions could be different from our estimates and current provisions, resulting in future adjustments to our revenue and\noperating results.\n42\n\n\nTable of Contents\nInventory Valuation. We value inventory at standard cost, adjusted to approximate the lower of actual cost or estimated net realizable value using assumptions\nabout future demand and market conditions. Material assumptions we use to estimate necessary inventory carrying value adjustments can be unique to each\nproduct and are based on specific facts and circumstances. In determining excess or obsolescence reserves for products, we consider assumptions such as\nchanges in business and economic conditions, other-than-temporary decreases in demand for our products, and changes in technology or customer\nrequirements. In determining the lower of cost or net realizable value reserves, we consider assumptions such as recent historical sales activity and selling\nprices, as well as estimates of future selling prices. If in any period we anticipate a change in assumptions such as future demand or market conditions to be\nless favorable than our previous estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales, resulting in a negative\nimpact to our gross margin in that period.

Overall, our estimates of inventory carrying value adjustments have been materially consistent with actual results.\nBusiness Combinations. We allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired\nbased on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is\nrecorded as goodwill. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets.\nSignificant estimates in valuing developed technology, in-process research and development, customer relationships and other identifiable intangible assets\ninclude, but are not limited to, expected future revenue growth rates and margins, future changes in technology, time to recreate customer relationships, useful\nlives, and discount rates.\nManagement's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a\nresult, actual results may differ from estimates. Allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable assets and liabilities affects our amortization expense, as\nacquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the useful life, whereas any indefinite lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortized.\nDuring the measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.\nGoodwill. Goodwill is the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred over the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection\nwith business combinations.

Our goodwill is contained within three reporting units: Data Center, Gaming\nand Embedded.\nWe perform our goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year and, if certain events or circumstances indicate that an\nimpairment loss may have been incurred, on a more frequent basis. The analysis may include both qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the likelihood\nof an impairment, which occurs when the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value.

The fair values of our reporting units are estimated using a combination of the income approach, which requires estimating the present value of expected\nfuture cash flows of a reporting unit, and the market approach, which uses financial ratios of comparable companies to arrive at an estimated value for the\nreporting unit. Significant estimates and assumptions used in the income approach include assessments of macroeconomic conditions, growth rates of our\nreporting units in the near- and long-term, expectations of our ability to execute on our roadmap and projections, and the discount rate applied to cash flows.\nSignificant estimates used in the market approach include the identification of comparable companies for each reporting unit, the determination of an\nappropriate control premium that a market participant would apply to a reporting unit, and the determination of appropriate multiples to apply to a reporting unit\nbased on adjustments and consideration of specific attributes of that reporting unit.\n43\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe most significant assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair values of our reporting units are the sales and earnings growth rates\n(including long-term growth rates) and discount rates. Long-term growth rates are dependent on overall market growth rates, the competitive environment and\ninflation. As a result, long-term growth rates could be adversely impacted by a sustained deceleration in category growth or an increased competitive\nenvironment. Discount rates, which are consistent with a weighted average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by a market participant, are based upon\nindustry required rates of return, including consideration of both debt and equity components of the capital structure. Our discount rates may be impacted by\nadverse changes in the macroeconomic environment, prolonged and continuing inflationary pressures, volatility in the equity and debt markets and other factors\nthat otherwise create or exacerbate risks in our reporting units. Changes in operating plans or adverse changes in the business or in the macroeconomic\nenvironment in the future could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair values and could result in a decline in fair value that would trigger future\nimpairment charges of our reporting units’ goodwill. Based on our annual impairment testing, the fair values of all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying\nvalues.\nLong-Lived and Intangible Assets. Long-lived and intangible assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment if indicators of potential impairment exist\nand at least annually for indefinite-lived intangible assets. Impairment indicators are reviewed on a quarterly basis. Assets are grouped and evaluated for\nimpairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. When indi",

In the event such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the recorded value of the assets, the\nassets are written down to their estimated fair values based on the expected discounted future cash flows attributable to the asset group or based on\nappraisals. Factors affecting impairment of assets held for use include the ability of the specific assets to generate separately identifiable positive cash flows.\nWhen assets are removed from operations and held for sale, we estimate impairment losses as the excess of the carrying value of the assets over their fair\nvalue. Market conditions are among the factors affecting impairment of assets held for sale. Changes in any of these factors could necessitate impairment\nrecognition in future periods for assets held for use or assets held for sale.\nIncome Taxes. In determining taxable income for financial statement reporting purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and\njudgments are applied in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets which arise from temporary\ndifferences between the recognition of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement reporting purposes.\nWe regularly assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. Unless recovery is considered more-likely-than-not (a probability level\nof more than 50%), we will record a charge to income tax expense in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not\nultimately be recoverable or maintain the valuation allowance recorded in prior periods. When considering all available evidence, if we determine it is more-\nlikely-than-not we will realize our deferred tax assets, we will reverse some or all of the existing valuation allowance, which would result in a credit to income tax\nexpense and the establishment of an asset in the period of reversal.\nIn determining the need to establish or maintain a valuation allowance, we consider the four sources of jurisdictional taxable income: (i) carryback of net\noperating losses to prior years; (ii) future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences; (iii) viable and prudent tax planning strategies; and (iv) future\ntaxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards.\nThrough the end of 2022, we continue to maintain a valuation allowance of approximately $2.1 billion for certain federal, state, and foreign tax attributes. The\nfederal valuation allowance maintained is due to limitations, under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 or 383, separate return loss year rules, or dual\nconsolidated loss rules. Certain state and foreign valuation allowances are maintained due to a lack of sufficient sources of future taxable income.\nIn addition, the c",

This is consistent with how our Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) assesses our financial performance and allocates resources. As a result,\nwe report our financial performance based on the following four reportable segments: Data Center, Client, Gaming, and Embedded.\nAdditional information on our reportable segments is contained in Note 4 – Segment Reporting of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form\n10-K).\nOur operating results tend to vary seasonally.

The increase was\nprimarily due to an increase in headcount through acquisitions and organic growth, go-to-market activities, and acquisition-related costs.\nAmortization of Acquisition-Related Intangibles\nIn 2022, cost of sales and operating expense included $1.4 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively, of amortization expense from intangible assets acquired as a\nresult of the acquisitions of Xilinx and Pensando.\nLicensing Gain\nDuring 2022, we recognized $102 million of licensing gain from milestone achievement and royalty income associated with the licensed IP to the THATIC JV,\nour two joint ventures with Higon Information Technology Co., Ltd., a third-party Chinese entity.

(Xilinx). On May 26, 2022 (the Pensando Acquisition\nDate), the Company completed the acquisition of Pensando Systems, Inc. (Pensando). See Note 5 - Business Combinations for additional information on these\nacquisitions.\nNOTE 2 – Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies\nFiscal Year. The Company uses a 52- or 53-week fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in December. Fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 ended on December 31,\n2022, December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020, respectively. Fiscal 2022 consisted of 53 weeks, and fiscal 2021 and 2020 each consisted of 52 weeks.\nPrinciples of Consolidation.  The consolidated financial statements include the Company’s accounts and those of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Upon\nconsolidation, all inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated.\nReclassification. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.\nUse of Estimates. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requires\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of commitments and contingencies at\nthe date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results are likely to differ from\nthose estimates, and such differences may be material to the financial statements. Areas where management uses subjective judgment include, but are not\nlimited to, revenue allowances, inventory valuation, valuation of goodwill and long-lived and intangible assets, and income taxes.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration which the\nCompany expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Sales, value-added, and other taxes collected concurrently with the provision of goods or\nservices are excluded from revenue. Shipping and handling costs associated with product sales are included in cost of sales. Substantially all the Company’s\nrevenue is derived from product sales, representing a single performance obligation.\nCustomers are generally required to pay for products and services within the Company’s standard contractual terms, which are typically net 30 to 60 days. The\nCompany has determined that it does not have significant financing components in its contracts with customers.\nNon-custom products\nThe Company transf",

Non-custom product arrangements generally comprise a single\nperformance obligation. Certain OEMs may be entitled to rights of return and rebates under OEM agreements. The Company also sells to distributors under\nterms allowing the majority of distributors certain rights of return and price protection on unsold merchandise held by them. The Company estimates the amount\nof variable consideration under OEM and distributor arrangements and, accordingly, records a provision for product returns, allowances for price protection and\nrebates based on actual historical experience and any known events.\n57\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe Company offers incentive programs to certain customers, including cooperative advertising, marketing promotions, volume-based incentives and special\npricing arrangements. Where funds provided for such programs can be estimated, the Company recognizes a reduction to revenue at the time the related\nrevenue is recognized; otherwise, the Company recognizes such reduction to revenue at the later of when: i) the related revenue transaction occurs; or ii) the\nprogram is offered. For transactions where the Company reimburses a customer for a portion of the customer’s cost to perform specific product advertising or\nmarketing and promotional activities, such amounts are recognized as a reduction to revenue unless they qualify for expense recognition.\nConstraints of variable consideration have not been material.\nCustom products\nCustom products which are associated with the Company’s Gaming segment (semi-custom products), sold under non-cancellable purchases orders, for which\nthe Company has an enforceable right to payment, and which have no alternative use to the Company at contract inception, are recognized as revenue, over\nthe time of production of the products by the Company. The Company utilizes a cost-based input method, calculated as cost incurred plus estimated margin, to\ndetermine the amount of revenue to recognize for in-process, but incomplete, customer orders at a reporting date. The Company believes that a cost-based\ninput method is the most appropriate manner to measure how the Company satisfies its performance obligations to customers because the effort and costs\nincurred best depict the Company’s satisfaction of its performance obligation.\nSales of semi-custom products are not subject to a right of return. Custom products arrangements generally involve a single performance obligation. There are\nno variable consideration estimates associated with custom products.\nDevelopment and intellectual property licensing agreements\nFrom time to time, the Company may enter into arrangements with customers that combine the provision of development services and a license to the right to\nuse the Company’s IP.

Revenue\nis recognized upon the transfer of control, over time or at a point in time, depending on the nature of the arrangements. The Company evaluates whether the\nlicensing component is distinct. A licensing component is distinct if it is both (i) capable of being distinct and (ii) distinct in the context of the arrangement. If the\nlicense is not distinct, it is combined with the development services as a single performance obligation and recognized over time. If the license is distinct,\nrevenue is recognized at a point in time when the customer has the ability to benefit from the license.\nFrom time to time, the Company may enter into arrangements with customers that solely involve the sale or licensing of its patents or IP. Generally, there are no\nperformance obligations beyond transferring the designated license to the Company’s patents or IP. Accordingly, revenue is recognized at a point in time when\nthe customer has the ability to benefit from the license.\nThere are no variable consideration estimates associated with either combined development and IP arrangements or for standalone arrangements involving\neither the sale or licensing of IP.\nInventories\nThe Company values inventory at standard cost, adjusted to approximate the lower of actual cost or estimated net realizable value using assumptions about\nfuture demand and market conditions. In determining excess or obsolescence reserves for its products, the Company considers assumptions such as changes\nin business and economic conditions, other-than-temporary decreases in demand for its products, and changes in technology or customer requirements. In\ndetermining the lower of cost or net realizable value reserves, the Company considers assumptions such as recent historical sales activity and selling prices, as\nwell as estimates of future selling prices. The Company fully reserves for inventories and non-cancellable purchase orders for inventory deemed obsolete. The\nCompany performs periodic reviews of inventory items to identify excess inventories on hand by comparing on-hand balances and non-cancellable purchase\norders to anticipated usage using recent historical activity as well as anticipated or forecasted demand. If estimates of customer demand diminish further or\nmarket conditions become less favorable than those projected by the Company, additional inventory carrying value adjustments may be required.\n58\n\n\nTable of Contents\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company is required to use the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations.

When determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially\nwith respect to intangible assets. Critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, expected future revenue growth rates and\nmargins, future changes in technology, time to recreate customer relationships, useful lives, and discount rates. Fair value estimates are based on the\nassumptions that management believes a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability. These estimates are inherently uncertain and, therefore,\nactual results may differ from the estimates made. As a result, during the measurement period of up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may\nrecord adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or\nfinal determination of the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded in the\nConsolidated Statements of Operations.\nGoodwill\nThe Company performs its goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year and, if certain events or circumstances indicate that\nan impairment loss may have been incurred, on a more frequent basis. The analysis may include both qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the\nlikelihood of an impairment.\nThe Company has the option to first perform qualitative testing to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying\namount. Qualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, share price trends and market capitalization and\nCompany-specific events. If the Company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, the Company\ndoes not proceed to perform a quantitative impairment test.\nIf the Company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value or elects to bypass the qualitative test, a\nquantitative goodwill impairment test will be performed by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. The Company’s quantitative\nimpairment analysis uses a combination of the income approach, which requires estimates of the present value of expected future cash flows of a reporting\nunit, and the market approach, which uses financial ratios of comparable companies to arrive at an estimated value for the reporting units. Significant estimates\nand assumptions used in the income approach include assessments of macroeconomic conditions, growth rates of reporting units in the near- and long-term,\nexpectations of the Company’s ability to execute on roadmaps and projections, and the discount rate applied to cash flows.

Significant estimates used in the\nmarket approach include the identification of comparable companies for each reporting unit, and the determination of the appropriate multiples to apply to a\nreporting unit based on adjustments and consideration of specific attributes of that reporting unit. If a reporting unit’s fair value is determined to be less than its\ncarrying value, a goodwill impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying value, not to exceed\nthe total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nLong-Lived and Intangible Assets\nLong-lived and intangible assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment if indicators of potential impairment exist and at least annually for indefinite-\nlived intangible assets. Impairment indicators are reviewed on a quarterly basis. Assets are grouped and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level of\nidentifiable cash flows.\nWhen indicators of impairment exist and assets are held for use, the Company estimates future undiscounted cash flows attributable to the related asset\ngroups. In the event such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the recorded value of the assets, the assets are written down to their estimated\nfair values based on the expected discounted future cash flows attributable to the asset group or based on appraisals. Factors affecting impairment of assets\nheld for use include the ability of the specific assets to generate separately identifiable positive cash flows.\nWhen assets are removed from operations and held for sale, the Company estimates impairment losses as the excess of the carrying value of the assets over\ntheir fair value. Market conditions are among the factors affecting impairment of assets held for sale. Changes in any of these factors could necessitate\nimpairment recognition in future periods for assets held for use or assets held for sale.\n59\n\n\nTable of Contents\nCash Equivalents\nCash equivalents consist of financial instruments that are readily convertible into cash and have original maturities of three months or less at the time of\npurchase.\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable are primarily comprised of trade receivables presented net of rebates, price protection and an allowance for credit loss. Accounts\nreceivable also include unbilled receivables, which primarily represent work completed on development services recognized as revenue but not yet invoiced to\ncustomers and semi-custom products under non-cancellable purchase orders that have no alternative use to the Company at contract inception, for which\nrevenue has been recognized but not yet invoiced to customers. All unbilled accounts receivables are expected to be billed and collected within twelve months.\nThe Company manages its exposure to customer credit risk through credit limits, credit lines, ongoing monitoring procedures and credit approvals.\nFurthermore, the Company performs in-depth credit evalua",

The Company maintains an allowance for credit loss,\nconsisting of known specific troubled accounts as well as an amount based on overall estimated potential uncollectible accounts receivable based on historical\nexperience and review of their current credit quality. The Company does not believe the receivable balance from its customers represents a significant credit\nrisk.\nInvestments\nAvailable for Sale Debt Securities. The Company classifies its investments in debt securities at the date of acquisition as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale\ndebt securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a\ncomponent of stockholders’ equity. If an available-for-sale debt security’s fair value is less than its amortized cost basis, then the Company evaluates whether\nthe decline is the result of a credit loss, in which case an impairment is recorded through an allowance for credit losses. Unrealized gains and losses not\nattributable to credit losses are included, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders’ equity. Classification of\navailable-for-sale debt securities as current or non-current is based on the Company’s intent and belief in its ability to sell these securities and use the proceeds\nfrom sale in operations within 12 months.\nNon-marketable Securities. The Company’s investments in non-marketable securities of privately-held companies are accounted for under the measurement\nalternative, defined as cost, less impairments, adjusted for subsequent observable price changes and are periodically assessed for impairment when events or\ncircumstances indicate that a decline in value may have occurred. The Company's periodic assessment of impairment is made by considering available\nevidence, including the investee’s general market and industry conditions and product development status. The Company also assesses the investee’s ability to\nmeet business milestones, its financial condition, and near-term prospects, including the rate at which the investee is using its cash, the investee’s need for\npossible additional funding at a lower valuation and any bona fide offer to purchase the investee.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company’s financial instruments are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, except for non-marketable equity investments in privately-\nheld companies, which are generally accounted for under the measurement alternative.\nFair Value Hierarchy\nThe fair value framework requires the categorization of assets and liabilities into three levels based upon the assumptions (inputs) used to price the assets or\nliabilities.

Level 3 assets and liabilities include those whose fair value measurements are determined using pricing models, discounted\ncash flow methodologies or similar valuation techniques, as well as significant management judgment or estimation.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of one to 15 years\nfor equipment, 34 to 44 years for buildings, and leasehold improvements are measured by the shorter of the remaining terms of the leases or the estimated\nuseful economic lives of the improvements.\nLeases\nOperating and finance leases are recorded as right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities on the Company’s balance sheet. ROU assets represent the\nCompany’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the\nlease. Operating and finance lease ROU assets and liabilities are initially recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. In\ndetermining the present value of lease payments, the Company uses the implicit interest rate if readily determinable. When the implicit interest rate is not\nreadily determinable, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate, which is based on its collateralized borrowing capabilities over a similar term of the\nlease payments. The Company utilizes the consolidated group incremental borrowing rate for all leases as the Company has centralized treasury operations.\nLease expense for operating lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company has elected the accounting policy to not\nrecognize ROU assets and lease liabilities that arise from short-term (12 months or less) leases for any class of underlying asset. Operating leases are included\nin operating lease ROU assets, other current liabilities, and long-term operating lease liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.

In addition, the Company’s marketing and advertising expenses include certain cooperative advertising funding\nobligations under customer incentive programs, which costs are recorded upon agreement with customers and vendor partners. Cooperative advertising\nexpenses are recorded as marketing, general and administrative expense to the extent the cash paid does not exceed the estimated fair value of the\nadvertising benefit received.

In addition, the Company is a party to environmental\nmatters including local, regional, state and federal government clean-up activities at or near locations where the Company currently or has in the past\nconducted business. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of\nreasonably possible losses. A determination of the amount of reserves required for these commitments and contingencies that would be charged to earnings, if\nany, includes assessing the probability of adverse outcomes and estimating the amount of potential losses.

The assessment requires significant judgment and is performed in each of the applicable taxing jurisdictions.

At the time an investment is made, investments in commercial paper of\nindustrial firms and financial institutions are rated A1, P1, F1 or better. The Company invests in bonds that are rated A, A2 or better and repurchase\nagreements, each of which have securities of the type and quality listed above as collateral.\nThe Company believes that concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited because a large number of geographically diverse\ncustomers make up the Company’s customer base, thus diluting the trade credit risk. One customer accounted for approximately 18% of the total consolidated\naccounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2022. Two customers each accounted for approximately 20% and 15% of the total consolidated accounts\nreceivable balance as of December 25, 2021.

The reduction in income tax expense in 2022 was primarily due to the lower pre-tax income coupled with a $261 million FDII tax\nbenefit and $241 million of research and development (R&D) tax credits.\nBeginning in 2022, provisions in the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 require the Company to capitalize and amortize R&D expenditures rather than\ndeducting the costs as incurred. The capitalization resulted in an increase in 2022 taxable income which also increased the income eligible for the FDII tax\nbenefit. Additionally, there was a pre-tax loss incurred outside of the U.S. primarily due to the GAAP amortization of Xilinx acquisition-related items and\ntherefore, the Company recorded a corresponding tax benefit associated with the reversal of the previously established GILTI deferred tax liability.\nAs a part of the Xilinx acquisition and as a result of certain employment and operational commitments the Company has made in Singapore, the Company has\nbeen granted a Development and Expansion Incentive (DEI) that is effective through 2031. The DEI reduces the local tax on Singapore income from a statutory\nrate of 17% to 5% through 2031. Due to the current year pre-tax loss, the Company did not receive any income tax or EPS benefit.\n82\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe Company recorded an income tax provision of $513 million in 2021 and an income tax benefit of $1.2 billion in 2020, representing effective tax rates of\n14% and (95)% respectively. The income tax provision in 2021 was a result of higher income in the U.S. and increase in foreign taxes, partially offset by $147\nmillion of FDII benefit, $78 million of R&D tax credits, and $125 million of excess tax benefit for stock-based compensation net of non-deductible officers’\ncompensation.\nThe income tax benefit in 2020 was primarily due to $1.3 billion of tax benefit from the valuation allowance release in the U.S. This benefit was partially offset\nby approximately $10 million of withholding tax expense related to cross-border transactions, $13 million of state and foreign taxes and $75 million increase in\nvaluation allowance against certain state and foreign tax credits, which are reflected as part of the state taxes and foreign rate benefit in the reconciliation table\nabove.\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of tax carryov",

The chemicals released into the groundwater were commonly used in the semiconductor industry in the United States\nin the wafer fabrication process prior to 1979.\nIn 1991, the Company received Final Site Clean-up Requirements Orders from the California Regional Water Quality Control Board relating to the three sites.\nThe Company has entered into settlement agreements with other responsible parties on two of the orders. During the term of such agreements, other parties\nhave agreed to assume most of the foreseeable costs as well as the primary role in conducting remediation activities under the orders. The Company remains\nresponsible for additional costs beyond the scope of the agreements as well as all remaining costs in the event that the other parties do not fulfill their\nobligations under the settlement agreements.\nTo address anticipated future remediation costs under the orders, the Company has computed and recorded an estimated environmental liability of\napproximately $3.9 million and has not recorded any potential insurance recoveries in determining the estimated costs of the cleanup. The progress of future\nremediation efforts cannot be predicted with certainty and these costs may change.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated\nfinancial statements, the Company adjusts the inventory carrying value to the lower of actual cost or the estimated net realizable\nvalue after completing ongoing reviews of on-hand inventory quantities exceeding forecasted demand and by considering recent\nhistorical activity as well as anticipated demand. Auditing management’s inventory carrying value adjustments involved\nsignificant judgment because the estimates are based on several factors that are affected by market, industry, and competitive\nconditions outside the Company's control. In estimating inventory carrying value adjustments, management developed\nassumptions such as forecasts of future sales quantities and the selling prices, which are sensitive to the competitiveness of\nproduct offerings, customer requirements, and product life cycles. These significant assumptions are forward-looking and could\nbe affected by future economic and market conditions.\nHow We Addressed the\nMatter in Our Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the\nCompany's inventory carrying value adjustment determination process, including the basis for developing the above-described\nassumptions and management’s judgments.\nOur audit procedures included, among others, testing the reasonableness of management’s key assumptions and judgments\nand testing the accuracy and completeness of the underlying data used to determine the amount of inventory carrying value\nadjustm",

(“Xilinx”) for consideration of $48.8 billion, as\ndisclosed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination.\nAuditing the Company's accounting for its acquisition of Xilinx was complex due to the significant estimation uncertainty in the\nCompany’s determination of the fair value of certain identified intangible assets, principally consisting of developed technology\nand customer relationships. The significant estimation uncertainty was primarily due to the sensitivity of the respective fair values\nto underlying assumptions about the future performance of the acquired business. The Company used a discounted cash flow\nmodel to measure the developed technology and customer relationship intangible assets. The significant assumptions used to\nestimate the value of these intangible assets included certain assumptions that form the basis of the forecasted results,\nspecifically, revenue growth rates, technology migration curves, and time to recreate customer relationships. These significant\nassumptions are forward looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions.\nHow We Addressed the\nMatter in Our Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s\naccounting for the acquisition. This included testing controls over the estimation process supporting the recognition and\nmeasurement of the developed technology and customer relationships intangible assets, including the valuation models and\nunderlying assumptions used to develop such estimates.\nTo test the estimated fair value of the developed technology and customer relationships intangible assets, we performed audit\nprocedures that included, among others, evaluating the Company's selection of the valuation methodology, evaluating the\nmethods and significant assumptions used by the Company, and evaluating the completeness and accuracy of the underlying\ndata supporting the ",
