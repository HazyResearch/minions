Total length: 494686 characters to answer this question. \n\nAlso consider the following constraints:\n- In your response do NOT use numbered lists.\n- Do NOT structure your response as a sequence of steps.\n",
      "output": "To determine if Verizon is a capital-intensive business based on FY 2022 data, focus on extracting key financial metrics and information related to capital expenditures and asset management. Look for details on Verizon's capital expenditures (CapEx) for the year, which will indicate the amount invested in physical assets like infrastructure, technology, and equipment. Compare CapEx to revenue and operating expenses to assess the proportion of funds allocated to capital investments. Examine the balance sheet for total assets and liabilities to understand the scale of Verizon's investments in long-term assets. Additionally, review any commentary or analysis in the financial document that discusses Verizon's business model, industry characteristics, and strategic priorities, as these can provide context on the capital intensity of the business. Consider industry benchmarks or comparisons to similar companies to gauge whether Verizon's capital intensity aligns with industry norms."

Instead, you can assign small, isolated tasks to a less capable worker model that sees only a single chunk of text at a time. Any cross-chunk or multi-document reasoning must be handled by you.\n\n## Your Job: Write Two Python Functions\n\n### FUNCTION #1: `prepare_jobs(context, prev_job_manifests, prev_job_outputs) -> List[JobManifest]`\n- Break the document(s) into chunks (using the provided chunking function, if needed). Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 12 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`. All **multi-chunk integration** or **global reasoning** is your responsibility here.\n- Return one **aggregated string** suitable for further supervisor inspection.\n\n\n\n## Relevant Pydantic Models\n\nThe following models are already in the global scope. **Do NOT redefine or re-import them.**\n\n### JobManifest Model\n```\nclass JobManifest(BaseModel):\n    chunk: str  # the actual text for the chunk of the document\n    task: str  # the actual task instruction for the small model\n    advice: str  # optional, any additional advice on how to perform the task\n\n    chunk_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    task_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    job_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n\n```\n\n### JobOutput Model\n```\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    citation: Optional[str]\n    answer: Optional[str]\n\n```\n\n## Function Signatures\n```\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        context (List[str]): A list of documents.

In addition, mobile video and \ndata needs are driving a greater need for wireless backhaul. Network providers, cable companies and niche players are \ncompetitors for this business opportunity. \nRegulatory Trends \nRegulatory Landscape \nVerizon operates in a regulated and highly competitive market, as described above. Some of our competitors are subject to fewer \nregulatory constraints than Verizon. For many services offered by Verizon, the FCC is our primary regulator. The FCC has \njurisdiction over interstate telecommunications services and other matters under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended \n(Communications Act or Act). Other Verizon services are subject to state and local regulation.\nVerizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K                                10 \n\n\nFederal, State and Local Regulation \nWireless Services \nThe FCC regulates several aspects of our wireless operations. Generally, the FCC has jurisdiction over the construction, \noperation, acquisition and transfer of wireless communications systems. All wireless services require use of radio frequency \nspectrum, the assignment and distribution of which is subject to FCC oversight. If demand continues to increase or if new \nspectrum is required for a future generation of technology, we can meet our needs for licensed spectrum by purchasing licenses \nor leasing spectrum from others, or by participating in a competitive bidding process to acquire new spectrum from the FCC. \nThose processes are subject to certain reviews, approvals and potential conditions. \nToday, Verizon holds FCC spectrum licenses that allow it to provide a wide range of mobile and fixed communications services, \nincluding both voice and data services. FCC spectrum licenses typically have a term of 10 years, at which time they are subject \nto renewal. While the FCC has routinely renewed all of Verizon’s wireless licenses, challenges could be raised in the future. If a \nwireless license was revoked or not renewed, Verizon would not be permitted to provide services on the spectrum covered by \nthat license. Some of our licenses require us to comply with so-called \"open access\" FCC regulations, which generally require \nlicensees of particular spectrum to allow customers to use devices and applications of their choice, subject to certain technical \nlimitations.

For example, some states \nimpose reporting and consumer protection requirements. Several states also have laws or regulations that address safety issues \n(for example, use of wireless handsets while driving), universal service funding, and taxation matters. Some states are also \nconsidering new network reliability or service quality requirements that may affect how and where we provide services if not \npreempted by federal law. In addition, wireless tower and antenna facilities are often subject to state and local zoning and land \nuse regulation, and securing approvals for new or modified facilities is often a lengthy and expensive process. \nBroadband \nVerizon offers many different broadband services. The FCC currently recognizes broadband internet access services as \n\"information services\" subject to a \"light touch\" regulatory approach rather than to the traditional, utilities-style regulations. \nHowever, the FCC could return to a more utilities-style regulation of broadband. Additionally, several states have adopted or are \nconsidering adopting laws or executive orders that would regulate broadband.  Although some of these have been challenged in \ncourt, the ultimate enforceability and effect of these state rules is uncertain. Regardless of regulation, Verizon remains committed \nto the open internet, which provides consumers with competitive choices and unblocked access to lawful websites and content. \nOur broadband commitment can be found on our website at https://www.verizon.com/about/our-company/verizon-broadband-\ncommitment. \nWireline Voice \nVerizon offers many different wireline voice services, including traditional telephone service and other services that rely on \ntechnologies such as VoIP. For regulatory purposes, legacy telephone services are generally considered to be \"common carrier\" \nservices. Common carrier services are subject to heightened regulatory oversight with respect to rates, terms and conditions and \nother aspects of the services. The FCC has not decided the regulatory classification of VoIP but has said VoIP service providers \nmust comply with certain rules, such as 911 capabilities and law enforcement assistance requirements. \nState public utility commissions regulate Verizon’s telephone operations with respect to certain telecommunications intrastate \nmatters.

The FCC has a body of rules that apply \nto cable operators, and these rules also generally apply to Verizon. In areas where Verizon offers its facilities-based multichannel \nvideo services, Verizon has been required to obtain a cable franchise from local government entities, or in some cases a state-\nwide franchise, and comply with certain one-time and ongoing obligations as a result. \nPrivacy and Data Security \nWe are subject to local, state, federal, and international laws and regulations relating to privacy and data security that impact all \nparts of our business, including wireline, wireless, broadband and the development and roll out of new products, such as those in \nthe artificial intelligence and IoT space.

Generally, attention to privacy and data security requirements is increasing at all levels of \ngovernment globally, and privacy-related legislation has been introduced or is under consideration in many locations. These \nregulations could have a significant impact on our businesses. \nPublic Safety and Cybersecurity \nThe FCC plays a role in addressing public safety concerns by regulating emergency communications services and mandating \nwidespread availability of both media (broadcast/cable) and wireless emergency alerting services. In response to cyber attacks \nthat have occurred or could occur in the future, however, the FCC or other regulators may attempt to increase regulation of the \ncybersecurity practices of providers. The FCC is also addressing the use by American companies of equipment produced by \ncertain companies deemed to cause potential national security risks. Verizon does not currently use equipment in its networks \nfrom vendors under such restrictions. In addition, due to recent natural disasters, federal and state agencies may attempt to \nimpose regulations to ensure continuity of service during disasters. For example, the FCC adopted rules requiring wireless \nproviders to support roaming on each other’s networks during disasters, and the California Public Utilities Commission has \nimposed regulations relating to back-up power for communications facilities. \nIntercarrier Compensation and Network Access \nThe FCC regulates some of the rates that carriers pay each other for the exchange of voi",

We fund our capital needs in part through \nborrowings in the public and private credit markets. Adverse changes in the financial markets, including increases in interest \nrates or changes in exchange rates, could increase our cost of borrowing, require us to post a significant amount of collateral, \nand/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for our operations or refinance existing indebtedness. In addition, our ability \nto obtain funding under asset-backed debt transactions is subject to our ability to continue to originate a sufficient amount of \nassets eligible to be securitized. Our borrowing costs also can be affected by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by \nindependent rating agencies, which are based, in significant part, on our performance as measured by customary credit metrics. \nA decrease in these ratings would likely increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing. A \nsevere disruption in the global financial markets could impact some of the financial institutions with which we do business, and \nsuch instability could also affect our access to financing. \nIncreases in costs for pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits may reduce our \nprofitability and increase our funding commitments. \nWith approximately 117,100 employees and approximately 186,700 retirees as of December 31, 2022 eligible to participate in \nVerizon’s benefit plans, the costs of pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits have a significant impact on our \nprofitability.

During the year ended December 31, 2022, these investments included $23.1 billion for \ncapital expenditures, inclusive of approximately $6.2 billion in C-Band related capital expenditures. See \"Cash Flows Used in \nInvesting Activities\" and \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" for additional information. We believe that our investments aimed at \nexpanding our portfolio of products and services will provide our customers with an efficient, reliable infrastructure for competing \nin the information economy. \nGlobal Network and Technology \nWe are focusing our capital spending on adding capacity and density to our 4G Long-Term Evolution (LTE) network, while also \nbuilding our next generation 5G network. We are densifying our networks by utilizing small cell technology, in-building solutions \nand distributed antenna systems. Network densification enables us to add capacity to address increasing mobile video \nconsumption and the growing demand for IoT products and services on our 4G LTE and 5G networks. Over the past several \nyears, we have been leading the development of 5G wireless technology industry standards and the ecosystems for fixed and \nmobile 5G wireless services. 5G technology enables higher throughput and lower latency than the 4G LTE technology and allows \nour networks to handle more traffic as the number of internet-connected devices grows. In January 2022, we began deploying C-\nBand spectrum, which has been built out to cover approximately 189 million POPs in the U.S. as of December 31, 2022. We \nexpect to continue deploying C-Band spectrum across the continental U.S. as more and more of the spectrum becomes \navailable for our use. We use low and mid-band spectrum and dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS) technology, to allow 5G service \nto run simultaneously with 4G LTE on multiple spectrum bands. With DSS, whenever customers move outside Verizon’s \nmillimeter wave and C-Band coverage areas, their 5G-enabled devices will remain on 5G technology using the lower spectrum \nbands where this network is available. This allows us to more fully and effectively utilize our current spectrum resources to serve \nboth 4G and 5G customers. \nTo compensate for the shrinking market for traditional copper-based products, we continue to build fiber-based networks \nsupporting data, video and advanced business services - areas where demand for reliable high-speed connections is growing. \nWe are transforming the architecture of our networks into our Intelligent Edge Network, providing improved efficiency and \nvirtualization, increased automation and opportunities for edge computing services that will support our fiber-based and radio \na",

We face competition from other communications and technology companies seeking to \nincrease their brand recognition and capture customer revenue with respect to the provision of wireless products and services, in \naddition to non-traditional offerings in mobile data. For example, Microsoft Corporation, Alphabet Inc., Apple Inc., Meta Platforms, \nInc. and others are offering alternative means for messaging and making wireless voice calls that, in certain cases, can be used \nin lieu of the wireless providers' voice service, as well as alternative means of accessing video content.

A securities rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization. Each rating \nshould be evaluated independently of any other rating. \nCovenants \nOur credit agreements contain covenants that are typical for large, investment grade companies. These covenants include \nrequirements to pay interest and principal in a timely fashion, pay taxes, maintain insurance with responsible and reputable \ninsurance companies, preserve our corporate existence, keep appropriate books and records of financial transactions, maintain \nour properties, provide financial and other reports to our lenders, limit pledging and disposition of assets and mergers and \nconsolidations, and other similar covenants. \nWe and our consolidated subsidiaries are in compliance with all of our restrictive covenants in our debt agreements. \nChange In Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash \nOur Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2022 totaled $2.6 billion, a $316 million decrease compared to December 31, \n2021, primarily as a result of the factors discussed above. \nRestricted cash at December 31, 2022 totaled $1.5 billion, a $266 million increase compared to restricted cash at December 31, \n2021, primarily related to cash collections on certain receivables that are required at certain specified times to be placed into \nsegregated accounts. The increase was primarily driven by the completion of asset-backed debt transactions during the year \nended December 31, 2022. \nFree Cash Flow \nFree cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that reflects an additional way of viewing our liquidity that, we believe, when \nviewed with our GAAP results, provides management, investors and other users of our financial information with a more \ncomplete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows. Free cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital \nexpenditures (including capitalized software) from net cash provided by operating activities. We believe it is a more conservative \nmeasure of cash flow since capital expenditures are necessary for ongoing operations. Free cash flow has limitations due to the \nfact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does \nnot incorporate payments made on finance lease obli",

These plans primarily \nrelate to our domestic business units. We made no discretionary contribution to our qualified pension plan in either 2022 or 2021. \nDuring 2022 and 2021, we made contributions of $53 million and $58 million to our nonqualified pension plans, respectively. \nOur overall investment strategy is to achieve a mix of assets that allows us to meet projected benefit payments while taking into \nconsideration risk and return. In an effort to reduce the risk of our portfolio strategy and better align assets with liabilities, we \nhave adopted a liability driven pension strategy that seeks to better match the interest rate sensitivity of the liability hedging \nassets with the interest rate sensitivity of the liability. We expect that the strategy will reduce the likelihood that assets will decline \nat a time when liabilities increase (referred to as liability hedging), with the goal to reduce the risk of underfunding to the plan and \nits participants and beneficiaries. Over time, as the asset allocation shifts to more liability hedging assets, this strategy will \ngenerally result in lower expected asset returns. In 2023, we expect discretionary qualified pension plan contributions to be \napproximately $200 million and nonqualified pension plan contributions to be insignificant. \nContributions to our other postretirement benefit plans generally relate to payments for benefits on an as-incurred basis since \nthese other postretirement benefit plans do not have funding requirements similar to the pension plans. We contributed $692 \nmillion and $885 million to our other postretirement benefit plans in 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Our wireless licenses provide us with the exclusive right to utilize certain radio frequency spectrum \nto provide wireless communication services.

As part of our \nqualitative assessment we considered several factors including the business enterprise value of our combined wireless business, \nmacroeconomic conditions (including changes in interest rates and discount rates), industry and market considerations (including \nindustry revenue and EBITDA margin results, projections and recent merger and acquisition activity), the recent and projected \nfinancial performance of our combined wireless business as a whole, as well as other factors including the result of our last \nquantitative assessment. Our annual impairment test in 2022 indicated that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our \nwireless licenses remained above their carrying value and, therefore, did not result in an impairment. \nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, we performed a quantitative impairment assessment, which indicated that the fair value of our \nwireless licenses is substantially in excess of their carrying value and, therefore, did not result in an impairment. Our quantitative \nimpairment assessment consisted of comparing the estimated fair value of our aggregate wireless licenses to the aggregated \ncarrying amount as of the test date. Under our quantitative assessment, we estimated the fair value of our wireless licenses \nusing the Greenfield approach.

We consider multiple factors in determining the allowance as discussed above. \nIf there is a deterioration of our customers’ financial condition or if future actual default rates on receivables in general differ from \nthose currently anticipated, we may have to adjust our allowance for credit losses, which would affect earnings in the period the \nadjustments are made. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. \nAcquisitions and Divestitures \nSpectrum License Transactions \nFrom time to time, we enter into agreements to buy, sell or exchange spectrum licenses. We believe these spectrum license \ntransactions have allowed us to continue to enhance the reliability of our wireless network while also resulting in a more efficient \nuse of spectrum. \nIn March 2020, the FCC's incentive auction, Auction 103, for spectrum licenses in the upper 37 GHz, 39 GHz, and 47 GHz bands \nconcluded.

As an incumbent licensee, our 39 GHz licenses provided us with incentive \npayments that were applied towards the purchase price of spectrum in the auction. The value of the licenses won by Verizon \namounted to $3.4 billion, of which $1.8 billion was settled with the relinquished 39 GHz licenses. \nIn February 2021, the FCC concluded Auction 107 for C-Band wireless spectrum. Verizon paid $45.5 billion for the licenses it \nwon, of which $44.6 billion was paid in the first quarter of 2021. In accordance with the rules applicable to the auction, Verizon is \nrequired to make additional payments to acquire the licenses. The payments are for our allocable share of clearing costs \nincurred by, and incentive payments due to, the incumbent license holders associated with the auction, which are estimated to be \n$7.7 billion. During 2021, we made payments of $1.3 billion primarily related to certain obligations for projected clearing costs. \nDuring 2022, we made additional payments of $1.6 billion for obligations related to accelerated clearing incentives and clearing \ncosts. We expect to continue to make payments related to clearing cost and incentive payment obligations through 2024, which \nwe expect to be $4.8 billion. These payments are dependent on the incumbent license holders accelerated clearing of the \nspectrum for Verizon’s use and, therefore, the final timing and amounts could differ based on the incumbent holders’ execution of \ntheir clearing process. In accordance with the FCC order, the clearing must be completed by December 2025. The carrying value \nof the wireless spectrum won in Auction 107 consists of all payments required to participate and purchase licenses in the auction, \nincluding Verizon’s allocable share of clearing costs incurred by, and incentive payments due to, the incumbent license holders \nassociated with the auction that we are obligated to pay in order to acquire the licenses, as well as capitalized interest to the \nextent qualifying activities have occurred. \nIn March 2022, Verizon signed agreements with satellite operators in which operators agreed to clear C-Band spectrum in certain \nmarkets and frequencies ahead of the previously expected December 2023 timeframe. During 2022, Verizon incurred costs \nassociated with these agreements of approximately $340 million, of which $310 million was paid as of the year ended December \n31, 2022. This early clearance accelerated Verizon's access to more spectrum in a number of key markets to support its 5G \ntechnology deployment. \nSee Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our spectrum license transactions. \nTracFone Wireless, Inc. \nIn September 2020, we entered into a purchase agreement (TracFone Purchase Agreement) with América Móvil to acquire \nTracFone, a leading provider of prepaid and value mobile services in the U.S. The transaction closed on",

We compared the actuarial assumptions used by management to historical \ntrends, current economic factors and evaluated the change in the employee benefit obligations from \nprior year due to the change in service cost, interest cost, actuarial gains and losses, benefit \npayments, contributions and other activities. In addition, we involved an actuarial specialist to assist in \nevaluating management’s methodology for determining the discount rate that reflects the maturity and \nduration of the benefit payments and is used to measure the employee benefit obligations. As part of \nthis assessment, we compared the projected cash flows to prior year projections and compared the \ncurrent year benefits paid to the prior year projected cash flows. To evaluate the health care cost \ntrends and per capita claims cost trends, we involved an actuarial specialist to assist in evaluating the \nassumptions and assessed whether the information was consistent with publicly available information, \nand whether any market data adjusted for entity-specific adjustments were applied. We also tested \nthe completeness and accuracy of the underlying data, including the participant data provided to \nmanagement’s actuarial specialists. \nImpairment Evaluation for Verizon Business Group Goodwill \nDescription of the \nMatter \nAt December 31, 2022, the Company’s goodwill related to its Verizon Business Group (Business) \nreporting unit was $7.5 billion and represented 2.0% of total assets. As discussed in Notes 1 and 4 of \nthe consolidated financial statements, goodwill is not amortized but rather is tested for impairment at \nthe reporting unit level at least annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. The \nimpairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit (calculated using a combination of a \nmarket approach and an income approach) to its carrying amount. \nAuditing management’s goodwill impairment test was complex and highly judgmental due to the \ninherent subjectivity of developing an estimate of the fair value of the reporting unit, which is based on \nassumptions about future conditions, transactions, or events whose outcome is uncertain and will \ntherefore be subject to change over time. In particular, the fair value estimate was sensitive to \nsignificant assumptions such as the discount rate, revenue growth rate and earnings before interest, \ntaxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) margins, which are affected by expected future market \nor economic conditions. \nHow We Addressed the \nMatter in Our Audit \nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of \ncontrols over the Company’s goodwill impairment review process. For example, we tested contr",

Monthly service is generally billed in \nadvance, which results in a contract liability. See Note 2 for additional information. For postpaid plans, where monthly usage \nexceeds the allowance, the overage usage represents options held by the customer for incremental services and the usage-\nbased fee is recognized when the customer exercises the option (typically on a month-to-month basis). \nFor our contracts related to wireline communication and connectivity services, in general, fixed monthly fees for service are billed \none month in advance, which results in a contract liability, and service revenue is recognized over the enforceable contract term \nas the service is rendered, as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the services through network \naccess and usage. While substantially all of our wireline service revenue contracts are the result of providing access to our \nnetworks, revenue from services that are not fixed in amount and, instead, are based on usage are generally billed in arrears and \nrecognized as the usage occurs. \nEquipment \nWe sell wireless devices and accessories under the Verizon brand and other brands.

We may offer certain promotions that provide billing credits applied over a specified term, contingent upon the \ncustomer maintaining service.

For arrangements considered leases or \nthat contain a lease that is accounted for separately, we determine the classification and initial measurement of the right-of-use \nasset and lease liability at the lease commencement date, which is the date that the underlying asset becomes available for use. \nFor both operating and finance leases, we recognize a right-of-use asset, which represents our right to use the underlying asset \nfor the lease term, and a lease liability, which represents the present value of our obligation to make payments arising over the \nlease term. The present value of the lease payments is calculated using the incremental borrowing rate for operating and finance \nleases. The incremental borrowing rate is determined using a portfolio approach based on the rate of interest that the Company \nwould have to pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over a similar term. Management \nuses the unsecured borrowing rate and risk-adjusts that rate to approximate a collateralized rate, which is updated on a quarterly \nbasis. \nI",

Deferred income taxes are recalculated annually at tax rates in effect for the years in which those tax assets and \nliabilities are expected to be realized or settled.

The first \nstep is recognition: we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, \nincluding resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. In evaluating \nwhether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we presume that the position will be examined by \nthe appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. The second step is measurement: a tax \nposition that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in \nthe financial statements. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being \nrealized upon ultimate settlement. Differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the \nfinancial statements will generally result in one or more of the following: an increase in a liability for income taxes payable, a \nreduction of an income tax refund receivable, a reduction in a deferred tax asset or an increase in a deferred tax liability. \nSignificant management judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and in determining our effective tax rate. \nStock-Based Compensation \nWe measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock-based compensation awards made to employees and directors \nbased on estimated fair values. See Note 10 for additional information. \nForeign Currency Translation and Transactions \nThe functional currency of our foreign operations is generally the local currency.

Additionally, customers may incur charges based on usage or additional optional \nservices purchased in conjunction with entering into a contract that can be cancelled at any time and therefore are not included \nin the transaction price.

When a customer enters into a device payment plan agreement with the right to \nupgrade to a new device, we account for this trade-in right as a guarantee obligation. We recognize a liability measured at fair \nvalue for the customer’s right to trade in the device which is determined by considering several factors, including the weighted-\naverage selling prices obtained in recent resales of similar devices eligible for trade-in. At December 31, 2022 and December 31, \n2021, the amount of the guarantee liability was $54 million and $77 million, respectively. \nWe may offer certain promotions that allow a customer to trade in their owned device in connection with the purchase of a new \ndevice.

At December 31, \n2022 and December 31, 2021, the amount of trade-in liability was $562 million and $366 million, respectively. \nIn addition, we may provide the customer with additional future billing credits that will be applied against the customer’s monthly \nbill as long as service is maintained.

Verizon’s experience has \nbeen that the payment attributes of longer tenured customers are highly predictive for estimating their reliability to make future \npayments. Customers with longer tenures tend to exhibit similar risk characteristics to other customers with longer tenures, and \nreceivables due from customers with longer tenures tend to perform better than receivables from customers that have not \npreviously been Verizon customers.

The custom credit risk score is generated automatically from the applicant’s credit data using \nproprietary custom credit models. The credit risk score measures the likelihood that the potential customer will become severely \ndelinquent and be disconnected for non-payment. For a small portion of short-tenured customer applications, a traditional credit \nreport is not available from one of the national credit reporting agencies because the potential customer does not have sufficient \ncredit history. In those instances, alternative credit data is used for the risk assessment. For Business customers, we also verify \nthe existence of the business with external data sources. \nBased on the custom credit risk score, we assign each customer a credit class, each of which has specified offers of credit. This \nincludes an account level spending limit and a maximum amount of credit allowed per device for Consumer customers or a \nrequired down payment percentage for Business customers. \nCredit Quality Information \nSubsequent to origination, we assess indicators for the quality of our wireless device payment plan agreement portfolio using two \nmodels, one for new customers and one for existing customers.

The RSUs that are settled \nin cash are classified as liability awards and the liability is measured at its fair value at the end of each reporting period.

Those estimates are based on a combination of factors including the \ncurrent market interest rates and valuation levels, consensus earnings expectations and historical long-term risk premiums. To \ndetermine the aggregate return for the pension trust, the projected return of each individual asset class is then weighted \naccording to the allocation to that investment area in the trust’s long-term asset allocation policy. \nThe assumed health care cost trend rates are as follows: \nHealth Care and Life \nAt December 31,\n2022\n2021\n2020 \nWeighted-average healthcare cost trend rate assumed for next year\n 6.60 %\n 6.20 %\n 6.20 % \nRate to which cost trend rate gradually declines\n 4.50 \n 4.50 \n 4.50 \nYear the rate reaches the level it is assumed to remain thereafter\n2031\n2029\n2029 \nPlan Assets \nThe Company’s overall investment strategy is to achieve a mix of assets that allows us to meet projected benefit payments while \ntaking into consideration risk and return. While target allocation percentages will vary over time, the current target allocation for \nplan assets is designed so that 41% to 51% of the assets have the objective of achieving a return in excess of the growth in \nliabilities (comprised of public equities, private equities, real estate, hedge funds, high yield bonds and emerging market debt) \nand 55% to 65% of the assets are invested as liability hedging assets (where interest rate sensitivity of the liability hedging \nassets better match the interest rate sensitivity of the liability) and a maximum of 10% is in cash. This allocation will shift as \nfunded status improves to a higher allocation of liability hedging assets. Target policies will be revisited periodically to ensure \nthey are in line with fund objectives. Both active and passive management approaches are used depending on perceived market \nefficiencies and various other factors.

The \ncarrying value of cash equivalents approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these investments. \nInvestments in securities traded on national and foreign securities exchanges are valued by the trustee at the last reported sale \nprices on the last business day of the year or, if no sales were reported on that date, at the last reported bid prices. Government \nobligations, corporate bonds, international bonds and asset-backed debt are valued using matrix prices with input from \nindependent third-party valuation sources. Over-the-counter securities are valued at the bid prices or the average of the bid and \nask prices on the last business day of the year from published sources or, if not available, from other sources considered reliable \nsuch as multiple broker quotes. \nCommingled funds not traded on national exchanges are priced by the custodian or fund's administrator at their net asset value \n(NAV). Commingled funds held by third-party custodians appointed by the fund managers provide the fund managers with a NAV. \nThe fund managers have the responsibility for providing this information to the custodian of the respective plan. \nThe investment manager of the entity values venture capital, corporate finance and natural resource limited partnership \ninvestments. Real estate investments are valued at amounts based upon appraisal reports prepared by either independent real \nestate appraisers or the investment manager using discounted cash flows or market comparable data. Loans secured by \nmortgages are carried at the lesser of the unpaid balance or appraised value of the underlying properties. The values assigned \nto these investments are based upon available and current market information and do not necessarily represent amounts that \nmight ultimately be realized. Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, estimated fair values might differ significantly from \nthe values that would have been used had a ready market for the securities existed. These differences could be material. \nForward currency contracts, futures, and options are valued by the trustee at the exchange rates and market prices prevailing on \nthe last business day of the year.

The decrease in the provision for income taxes was primarily \ndue to the decrease in income before income taxes in the current period. \nThe effective income tax rate for 2021 was 23.1% compared to 23.4% for 2020. The decrease in the effective income tax rate \nwas primarily due to the sale of Verizon Media in 2021, partially offset by the non-recurring tax benefit recognized in 2020 from a \nseries of legal entity restructurings. The increase in the provision for income taxes was primarily due to the increase in income \nbefore income taxes in 2021. \nThe amounts of cash taxes paid by Verizon are as follows: \n(dollars in millions) \nYears Ended December 31,\n2022\n2021\n2020 \nIncome taxes, net of amounts refunded\n$ \n2,736 \n$ \n3,040 \n$ \n2,725 \nEmployment taxes\n1,245 \n1,225 \n618 \nProperty and other taxes\n1,959 \n1,756 \n2,093 \nTotal\n$ \n5,940 \n$ \n6,021 \n$ \n5,436 \n \n \n \n \n \n \nVerizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K                                98 \n\n\nDeferred Tax Assets and Liabilities \nDeferred taxes arise because of differences in the book and tax bases of certain assets and liabilities.

Commitments and Contingencies \nIn the ordinary course of business, Verizon is involved in various commercial litigation and regulatory proceedings at the state \nand federal level. Where it is determined, in consultation with counsel based on litigation and settlement risks, that a loss is \nprobable and estimable in a given matter, Verizon establishes an accrual. In none of the currently pending matters is the amount \nof accrual material. An estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss in excess of the amounts already accrued \ncannot be made at this time due to various factors typical in contested proceedings, including: (1) uncertain damage theories and \ndemands; (2) a less than complete factual record; (3) uncertainty concerning legal theories and their resolution by courts or \nregulators; and (4) the unpredictable nature of the opposing party and its demands. We continuously monitor these proceedings \nas they develop and adjust any accrual or disclosure as needed. We do not expect that the ultimate resolution of any pending \nregulatory or legal matter in future periods will have a material effect on our financial condition, but it could have a material effect \non our results of operations for a given reporting period. \nVerizon is currently involved in approximately 25 federal district court actions alleging that Verizon is infringing various patents. \nMost of these cases are brought by no",

These cases have progressed to various \nstages and a small number may go to trial in the coming 12 months if they are not otherwise resolved. \nIn connection with the execution of agreements for the sales of businesses and investments, Verizon ordinarily provides \nrepresentations and warranties to the purchasers pertaining to a variety of nonfinancial matters, such as ownership of the \nsecurities being sold, as well as indemnity from certain financial losses. From time to time, counterparties may make claims \nunder these provisions, and Verizon will seek to defend against those claims and resolve them in the ordinary course of \nbusiness. \nAs of December 31, 2022, letters of credit totaling approximately $834 million, which were executed in the normal course of \nbusiness and support several financing arrangements and payment obligations to third parties, were outstanding. \nDuring 2022, Verizon entered into four renewable energy purchase agreements (REPAs) with third parties, in addition to 20 \nsigned in previous years. Each of the REPAs is based on the expected operation of a renewable energy-generating facility and \nhas a fixed price term of 12 to 18 years from the commencement of the facility's entry into commercial operation. Seven of the \nfacilities have entered into commercial operation, and the remainder are under development. The REPAs generally are expected \nto be financially settled based on the prevailing market price as energy is generated by the facilities. \nWe have various unconditional purchase obligations, which represent agreements to purchase goods or services that are \nenforceable and legally binding. We estimate that these unconditional purchase obligations, for contracts with terms in excess of \none year, total $24.5 billion, and primarily represent commitments to purchase network equipment, software and services, \ncontent, marketing services and other items which will be used or sold in the ordinary course of business from a variety of \nsuppliers. Of this total amount, $9.4 billion is attributable to 2023, $6.9 billion is attributable to 2024, $5.5 billion is attributable to \n2025, $1.4 billion is attributable to 2026, $772 million is attributable to 2027 and $524 million is attributable to years thereafter. \nThese amounts do not represent our entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items that are the \nVerizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K                                106 \n\n\nsubject of contractual obligations.

Controls and Procedures \nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures \nOur Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant’s disclosure controls \nand procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), as of the end of the \nperiod covered by this Annual Report, that ensure that information relating to the registrant which is required to be disclosed in \nthis report is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within required time periods using the criteria for effective internal \ncontrol established in Internal Control–Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the \nTreadway Commission in 2013. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded \nthat the registrant’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2022. \nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting \nIn the ordinary course of business, we routinely review our system of internal control over financial reporting and make changes \nto our systems and processes that are intended to ensure an effective internal control environment. In the third quarter of 2020, \nwe began a multi-year implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, which will replace many of \nour existing core financial systems. The new ERP system is designed to enhance the flow of financial information, facilitate data \nanalysis and accelerate information reporting. The implementation is expected to occur in phases over the next several years. \nAs the phased implementation of the new ERP system continues, we could have changes to our processes and procedures \nwhich, in turn, could result in changes to our internal controls over financial reporting. As such changes occur, we will evaluate \nquarterly whether such changes materially affect our internal control over financial reporting. \nThere were no changes in Verizon's internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter 2022 that have materially \naffected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. \nManagement's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting \nThe management of Verizon Communications Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over \nfinancial reporting of Verizon.

The excerpt discusses operational risks, including cyber attacks, and their potential impact on the company's business, but it does not mention capital expenditures.\n\nHowever, I did find a mention of the \"costly\" development and maintenance of systems to prevent cyber attacks, but this is not a specific figure or trend related to capital expenditures.\n\nTherefore, my response is:\n\nNone\nExplanation: After reviewing the provided document excerpt, I did not find any information related to capital expenditures, including specific figures, trends, or context.\nExplanation: Based on the provided document excerpt, I did not find any specific information related to capital expenditures, including specific figures, trends, or context.

However, the context is not directly related to capital expenditures, but rather to the company's share repurchase plan.\n\nOverall, the information related to capital expenditures is limited and does not provide specific figures or trends.\n\nHere is the extracted information:\n\n* Network equipment is a significant capital\nExplanation: Based on the provided document excerpt, I found the following information related to capital expenditures:\n\n1. **Authorized share buyback program**: At December 31, 2022, the maximum number of shares that could be purchased by or on behalf of Verizon under the share buyback program was 100 million. However, it's mentioned that Verizon did not repurchase any shares of the Company's common stock under the program during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.\n\n2. **Capital allocation priorities**: The timing and number of shares purchased under the share buyback program, if any, will depend on market conditions and Verizon's capital allocation priorities.\n\n3. **Capital investments**: The document mentions that Verizon's strategy requires significant capital investments primarily to acquire wireless spectrum, put the spectrum into service, provide additional capacity for growth in their networks, invest in the fiber that supports their businesses, evolve and maintain their networks, and develop and maintain significant advanced information technology.\n\nHowever, I\nCitation: Our strategy requires significant capital investments primarily to acquire wireless spectrum, put the spectrum into service, provide additional capacity for growth in our networks, invest in the fiber that supports our businesses, evolve and maintain our networks and develop and maintain significant advanced information technology.\nAnswer: Based on the provided document excerpt, the final answer to the task is:\n\n1. **Capital Expenditures Figures:**\n   - 2022: $23,087 million\n   - 2021: $20,286 million\n\n2. **Trend:**\n   - Capital expenditures increased by $2,801 million (13.8%) from 2021 to 2022.\n\n3. **Context:**\n   - The company invested heavily in capital expenditures in 2022\nExplanation: Based on the provided document excerpt, I extracted the following information related to capital expenditures:\n\n1. **Capital Expenditures Figures:**\n   - 2022: $23,087 million\n   - 2021: $20,286 million\n\n2. **Trend:**\n   - Capital expenditures increased by $2,801 million (13.8%) from 2021 to 2022.\n\n3. **Context:**\n   - The company invested heavily in capital expenditures in 2022, particularly in deploying C-Band spectrum, which is expected to drive innovative products and services and fuel growth.\n\nThe information was extracted from the \"Highlights of Our 2022 Financial Results\" section, which includes a table with financial metrics, and the context was derived from the \"Business Overview\" section, which discusses the company's strategic business units and investments in network architecture and technologies.\nCitation: Highlights of Our 2022 Financial Results \n(dollars in millions)\nOperating Revenues\n$136,835\n$133,613\n2022\n2021\nOperating Income\n$30,467\n$32,448\n2022\n2021\nNet Income\n$21,748\n$22,618\n2022\n2021\nCash Flows from \nOperations\n$37,141\n$39,539\n2022\n2021\nCapital Expenditures\n$23,087\n$20,286\n2022\n2021\nExplanation: After analyzing the provided document excerpt, I found no specific information related to capital expenditures, including specific figures, trends, or context.

Non-Cash Transactions:\n   - During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, the company financed the purchase of long-lived assets consisting primarily of network equipment through alternative financing arrangements.\n   - The specific figures for these purchases are:\n     - 2022: approximately $832 million\n     - 2021: approximately $461 million\n     - 2020: approximately $1.7 billion\n   - As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, relating to these financing arrangements remained outstanding.\n\n2. Note 8. Device Payment Plan Agreement and Wireless Service Receivables:\n   - This section does not directly discuss capital expenditures but mentions accounts receivable, which might be related to financing arrangements for capital\nCitation: During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we financed, primarily through alternative financing arrangements, the purchase of approximately $832 million, $461 million, and $1.7 billion, respectively, of long-lived assets consisting primarily of network equipment.\nExplanation: Based on the provided document excerpt, there is no direct information related to capital expenditures. However, I can extract some information related to device payment plan agreement receivables, which might be indirectly related to capital investments.\n\nThe relevant information is as follows:\n\n* The Verizon device payment program allows customers to purchase wireless devices under a device payment plan agreement.\n* The program has led to the creation of device payment plan agreement receivables, which are recognized in the company's consolidated balance sheets.\n* The following table displays device payment plan agreement receivables, net, recognized in the company's consolidated balance sheets:\n\n| At December 31, | Device payment plan agreement receivables, gross | Unamortized imputed interest | Device payment plan agreement receivables, at amortized cost | Allowance | Device payment plan agreement receivables, net |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2022 | $26,188 | (479) | $\nExplanation: Based on the provided document excerpt, there is no information related to capital expenditures. The excerpt primarily discusses accounting practices and financial metrics related to device payment plan agreements, trade-in liabilities, and guarantee obligations.\n\nHowever, I did find some information related to financial metrics, specifically the amounts of guarantee liability and trade-in liability at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. These figures are:\n\n- Guarantee liability: $54 million (2022) and $77 million (2021)\n- Trade-in liability: $562 million (2022) and $366 million (2021)\n\nThese figures are related to the company's accounting practices and financial metrics, but they do not directly relate to capital expenditures.\nExplanation: Based on the provided document excerpt, there is no information related to capital expenditures. The document primarily discusses credit decision-making processes, credit risk assessment, and allowance for credit losses, but does not mention capital expenditures or investments.\n\nHowever, I can provide some context on why this might be the case. The document appears to be focused on the financial health and risk management of a wireless service provider, particularly in regards to their credit and receivables portfolios. This suggests that the company's financial priorities may be more focused on managing debt and credit risk rather than investing in capital expenditures.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the task is:\n\nNone\nExplanation: No relevant information found.\nExplanation: No relevant information found.\nExplanation: After reviewing the provided document excerpt, I found no information related to capital expenditures. The excerpt primarily discusses liabilities, including interest rate swaps, forward starting interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps, contingent consideration, and other liabilities. It also mentions investments in unconsolidated businesses and fixed income securities, but does not provide any information on capital expenditures.\n\nHowever, I did find a mention of payments made related to contingent consideration, which might be considered a type of capital expenditure. Here are the relevant figures:\n\n* During 2022, payments of $188 million were made related to the contingent consideration.\n* In January 2023, an additional payment of $102 million was made related to the contingent consideration.\n\nThese figures are related to payments made, rather than capital expenditures, but they might be considered relevant in a broader context.\nExplanation: After reviewing the provided document excerpt, I found no information related to capital expenditures. The document primarily discusses the fair value of debt, derivative instruments, and risk management strategies. \n\nHowever, I did find information related to finance leases, which might be considered a form of capital expenditure. According to the document, the fair value of debt, excluding finance leases, is reported.\nExplanation: After reviewing the provided document excerpt, I found no information related to capital expenditures. The excerpt primarily discusses hedging activities, interest rate swaps, and cross currency swaps, which are related to financial risk management and accounting practices.\n\nHowever, I did find a section that discusses cash flows from operating activities, which includes the settlement of interest rate swaps and forward starting interest rate swaps. While this information is related to financial transactions, it does not directly relate to capital expenditures.\n\nTherefore, my response is:\n\nNone\nExplanation: No relevant information found.\nExplanation: Based on the provided document excerpt, I did not find any information related to capital expenditures. The excerpt primarily discusses financial instruments, hedging strategies, and derivative contracts, but does not mention capital expenditures or investments.\n\nHowever, I did find a mention of \"temporary cash investments, short-term and long-term investments\" in the section on \"Concentrations of Credit Risk.\" This could be related to investments, but it is not clear if it refers to capital expenditures or not.\n\nIf you would like me to extract information on investments, I can do so, but it would not be directly related to capital expenditures.\n\nIf you would like me to extract information on investments, here is the relevant information:\n\n* Temporary cash investments, short-term and long-term investments are mentioned as concentrations of credit risk.\n* At December 31, 2022, the company held $0.1 billion of collateral related to derivative contracts under collateral exchange arrangements.\n* At December 31, 2022, the company\nExplanation: No relevant information found.\nExplanation: No relevant information found.\nExplanation: None\n\nThere is no information related to capital expenditures in the provided document excerpt.

The document appears to be focused on the financial statements and fair value measurements of pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans for Verizon, a telecommunications company.\n\nThe tables and sections provided discuss asset categories, fair values, and reconciliations of pension plan assets, but do not mention capital expenditures or investments. Therefore, I conclude that there is no relevant information related to capital expenditures in the provided document excerpt.\n\nResponse: None\nExplanation: After reviewing the provided document excerpt, I found no information related to capital expenditures.

But this is not a direct mention of capital expenditures, rather it's a part of the deferred tax liabilities.\n\nTherefore, my response is:\n\nNone\nExplanation: No relevant information found.\nExplanation: After reviewing the provided document excerpt, I did not find any information related to capital expenditures, including specific figures, trends, or context.\nExplanation: After reviewing the provided document excerpt, I found the following information related to capital expenditures:\n\n1. **Depreciation and amortization expense**: This is a non-cash expense that represents the allocation of the cost of assets over their useful lives. The expense is reported in the income statement and is a key metric for understanding the company's capital expenditures.\n\nFrom the tables provided:\n\n- **2022**:\n  - Depreciation and amortization expense for the Consumer segment: $12,716 million\n  - Depreciation and amortization expense for the Business segment: $4,312 million\n  - Total depreciation and amortization expense: $17,028 million\n\n- **2021**:\n  - Depreciation and amortization expense for the Consumer segment: $11,654 million\n  - Depreciation and amortization expense for the Business segment: $3,955 million\n  - Total depreciation and amortization expense: $15,609 million\n\n2. **\nExplanation: After reviewing the provided document excerpt from Verizon's 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K, I was unable to find any specific information related to capital expenditures. However, I did find a mention of depreciation and amortization expense, which is a non-cash expense that represents the allocation of the cost of assets over their useful lives.

The document appears to be a part of an annual report, specifically focusing on financial statements and notes, but it does not mention capital expenditures or investments.\n\nHowever, I did find a table related to \"Income Statement Information\" which includes depreciation expense, interest costs on debt balances, and capitalized interest costs. While capitalized interest costs are related to the financing of assets, they do not directly represent capital expenditures.\n\nIf you're looking for information on capital expenditures, I would recommend searching for a different section or document within the annual report or other financial statements.\n\nHere's the relevant table:\n\nIncome Statement Information\n(dollars in millions)\nYears Ended December 31,\n2022\n2021\n2020\nCapitalized interest costs\n(2,030)\n(1,841)\n(555)\n\nPlease note that this information is related to capitalized interest costs, not capital expenditures.\nAnswer: As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, Property, plant and equipment includes approximately $6.0 billion and $5.9 billion of additions that have not yet been paid.\nExplanation: Based on the provided document excerpt, I found relevant information related to capital expenditures in the following sections:\n\n1. **Property, plant and equipment**: The excerpt mentions that as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, Property, plant and equipment includes approximately $6.0 billion and $5.9 billion of additions that have not yet been paid.\n\n2. **Cash Flow Information**: Although this section primarily discusses cash flows from operating and financing activities, it indirectly provides information on capital expenditures. The section mentions that the additions to Property, plant and equipment are not yet paid, implying that they are part of the company's capital expenditures.\n\nHowever, I did not find any specific figures or trends related to capital expenditures in the provided excerpt. The information is limited to the fact that there are additions to Property, plant and equipment that have not yet been paid.\n\nTo provide a more comprehensive answer, I would need access to the full Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nCitation: As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, Property, plant and equipment includes approximately $6.0 billion and $5.9 billion of additions that have not yet been paid.\nAnswer: Based on the provided document excerpt, the information related to capital expenditures is as follows:\n\n1.
