  "correctness_reasoning": "The predicted answer correctly identifies the decrease in operating margin for 3M in FY2022 and provides specific factors contributing to this change, such as raw material impact, increased litigation costs, and PFAS manufacturing exit costs. These align with the ground truth answer, which mentions a decrease in gross margin and one-off charges related to litigation and PFAS exit. The numerical change in operating margin is within the 10% tolerance range. Therefore, the predicted answer is correct."
