--- Question ---
Roughly how many times has JnJ sold its inventory in FY2022? Calculate inventory turnover ratio for FY2022; if conventional inventory management is not meaningful for the company then state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
The inventory turnover ratio for Johnson & Johnson in FY2022 is approximately 2.72 times. Conventional inventory management may not be meaningful for the company due to its complex global supply chain and diverse product portfolio, which require tailored inventory management strategies.

--- Ground Truth ---
['JnJ sold its inventory 2.7 times in FY2022.']

--- Correctness Evaluation ---
Is correct: True
Confidence: 0.95
Reasoning: The predicted inventory turnover ratio of 2.72 is within the 10% tolerance range of the ground truth value of 2.7. Additionally, the explanation about conventional inventory management not being meaningful due to JnJ's complex global supply chain and diverse product portfolio is a reasonable context that does not contradict the ground truth.
