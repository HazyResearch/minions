  "predicted_answer": "Gross margins are not a relevant metric for JPMorgan Chase, as it is a financial institution. Instead, metrics like net interest margin, return on assets, and efficiency ratio are more appropriate for assessing the bank's performance. The outputs did not provide historical data on gross margins, which aligns with the understanding that this metric is not applicable to JPM.",

    "Since JPM is a financial institution, gross margin is not a relevant metric."
