  "correctness_reasoning": "The predicted answer states that AMCOR's quick ratio declined from 0.928 in FY2022 to 0.915 in FY2023, which contradicts the ground truth answer that indicates an improvement from 0.67 to 0.69. The numerical values in the predicted answer are outside the 10% tolerance range of the ground truth values, leading to a conclusion that the predicted answer is incorrect."
