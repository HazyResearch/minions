Define net working capital as total current assets less total current liabilities. Answer in USD millions. Respond to the question by assuming the perspective of an investment analyst who can only use the details shown within the balance sheet.\n\n---\n\nPlease provide succinct advice on the critical information we need to extract from the Financial document. Total length: 537519 characters to answer this question. \n\nAlso consider the following constraints:\n- In your response do NOT use numbered lists.\n- Do NOT structure your response as a sequence of steps.\n",
      "output": "To determine Lockheed Martin's FY2021 net working capital, focus on extracting the relevant figures from the balance sheet section of the financial document. Specifically, identify the total current assets and total current liabilities for FY2021. Net working capital is calculated by subtracting total current liabilities from total current assets. Ensure that the figures are clearly labeled as pertaining to FY2021 and are expressed in USD millions. As an investment analyst, it is crucial to rely solely on the data presented in the balance sheet without making assumptions or using external information."

      "prompt": "# Decomposition Round #1\n\nYou (the supervisor) cannot directly read the document(s). Instead, you can assign small, isolated tasks to a less capable worker model that sees only a single chunk of text at a time. Any cross-chunk or multi-document reasoning must be handled by you.\n\n## Your Job: Write Two Python Functions\n\n### FUNCTION #1: `prepare_jobs(context, prev_job_manifests, prev_job_outputs) -> List[JobManifest]`\n- Break the document(s) into chunks (using the provided chunking function, if needed). Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 12 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`. All **multi-chunk integration** or **global reasoning** is your responsibility here.\n- Return one **aggregated string** suitable for further supervisor inspection.\n\n\n\n## Relevant Pydantic Models\n\nThe following models are already in the global scope. **Do NOT redefine or re-import them.**\n\n### JobManifest Model\n```\nclass JobManifest(BaseModel):\n    chunk: str  # the actual text for the chunk of the document\n    task: str  # the actual task instruction for the small model\n    advice: str  # optional, any additional advice on how to perform the task\n\n    chunk_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    task_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    job_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n\n```\n\n### JobOutput Model\n```\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    citation: Optional[str]\n    answer: Optional[str]\n\n```\n\n## Function Signatures\n```\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        context (List[str]): A list of documents.

In 2021, 71% of our $67.0 billion in net sales were from the U.S. Government, either as a prime contractor or as a subcontractor\n(including 62% from the Department of Defense (DoD)), 28% were from international customers (including foreign military sales (FMS) contracted through the U.S.\nGovernment) and 1% were from U.S. commercial and other customers. Our main areas of focus are in defense, space, intelligence, homeland security and information\ntechnology, including cybersecurity.\nWe operate in an environment characterized by both complexity in global security and continuing economic pressures in the U.S. and globally. A significant\ncomponent of our strategy in this environment is to focus on program execution, improving the quality and predictability of the delivery of our products and services, and\nplacing security capability quickly into the hands of our U.S. and international customers at affordable prices. Recognizing that our customers are resource constrained, we\nplace considerable focus on affordability initiatives while endeavoring to develop and extend our portfolio domestically in a disciplined manner, with a focus on adjacent\nmarkets close to our core capabilities as well as growing our international sales. We invest substantially in our people to ensure we have the technical skills necessary to\nsucceed, and we expect to continue to invest internally on innovative technologies that address rapidly evolving mission requirements for our customers. We will continue\nto invest in acquisitions, as appropriate, while deepening our connection to commercial industry through cooperative partnerships, joint ventures, and equity investments.\nWe operate in four business segments: Aeronautics, Missiles and Fire Control (MFC), Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) and Space.

The Business Resource Groups foster a diverse and inclusive workplace aligned with our organizational mission, values, goals and business\npractices and drive awareness and change within our organization. Through these and other focused efforts, we have improved the diversity of our overall U.S. workforce\nand within leadership positions, specifically in the representation of women, people of color and people with disabilities.

Risk Factors\nAn investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties. We seek to identify, manage and mitigate risks to our business, but risk and\nuncertainty cannot be eliminated or necessarily predicted. The outcome of one or more of these risks could have a material effect on our operating results, financial\nposition, or cash flows. You should carefully consider the following factors, in addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before\ndeciding to purchase our common stock or debt securities.\nRisks Related to our Reliance on Government Contracts\nWe depend heavily on contracts with the U.S. Government for a substantial portion of our business. Changes in the U.S. Government’s priorities, or delays or\nreductions in spending could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe derived 71% of our total consolidated net sales from the U.S. Government in 2021, including 62% from the DoD. We expect to continue to derive most of our sales\nfrom work performed under U.S. Government contracts. Those contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of Congressional appropriations. Congress\nusually appropriates funds on a fiscal year (FY) basis even though contract performance may extend over many years. Consequently, contracts are often partially funded\ninitially and additional funds are committed only as Congress makes further appropriations over time. If we incur costs in excess of funds obligated on a contract or in\nadvance of a contract award, we may be at risk of not being reimbursed for those costs unless and until additional funds are obligated under the contract or the contract is\nawarded and funded.\nBudget uncertainty, the risk of future budget cuts, the potential for U.S. Government shutdowns, the use of continuing resolutions, and the federal debt ceiling can\nadversely affect our industry and the funding for our programs. If appropriations were delayed or a government shutdown were to occur and were to continue for an\nextended period of time, we could be at risk of program cancellations and other disruptions and nonpayment. When the U.S. Government operates under a continuing\nresolution, new contract and program starts are restricted and funding for our programs may be unavailable, reduced or delayed. Shifting funding priorities or federal\nbudget compromises, could also result in reductions in overall defense spending on an absolute or inflation-adjusted basis, which could adversely impact our business. Our\nbusiness could also be adversely impacted by reductions or delays in spending by non-U.S. government customers who are facing budget pressures.\nWe believe our diverse range of products and services generally make it less likely that cuts in any specific contract or program will affect our business on a long-term\nbasis.

A decision by the U.S. Government or other governments to cut spending on this program or reduce or delay planned orders would have an adverse\nimpact on our business and results of operations.

FMS contracts with the U.S. Government are subject to the FAR and the DFARS. In contrast, DCS transactions represent sales by us directly to\ninternational customers and are not subject to the FAR or the DFARS, although they are subject to the procurement regulations of the international customer. Sales to\ninternational customers are subject to U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including import-export control, technology transfer restrictions, investments, taxation,\nrepatriation of earnings, exchange controls, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws and regulations, and the anti-boycott provisions of the U.S.\nExport Control Reform Act of 2018. While we have extensive policies in place to comply with such laws and regulations, failure by us, our employees or others working\non our behalf to comply with these laws and regulations could result in administrative, civil, or criminal liabilities, including suspension, debarment from bidding for or\nperforming government contracts, or suspension of our export privileges, which could have a material adverse effect on us.

The U.S. Government sanctions on SSB and certain affiliated persons,\nand Turkey’s removal from the F-35 program have not resulted in significant adverse financial effects on the F-35 program to date; however, unforeseen actions could\nimpact the timing of orders, disrupt the production of aircraft, delay delivery of aircraft, disrupt delivery of sustainment components produced in Turkey and impact\nfunding on the F-35 program, including impacts resulting from any reprogramming of funds that may be necessary to mitigate the impact of procuring alternate sources for\nTurkish made components. Although, in the case of the F-35 program, we expect that these costs ultimately would be recovered from the U.S. Government; the availability\nor timing of any recovery could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations.\nWe have a number of contracts with Turkish industry for the Turkish Utility Helicopter Program (TUHP), which anticipates co-production with Turkish industry for\nproduction of T70 helicopters for use in Turkey, as well as the related provision of Turkish goods and services under buy-back or offset obligations, to include the future\nsales of helicopters built in Turkey for sale globally. Although existing export licenses are not subject to the current sanctions, we continue to expect pending and future\nexport licensing applications and any required modifications, extensions or changes in scope to the existing licenses where SSB or any of certain affiliated persons is a\nparty to the underlying transaction to be denied, which denials would adversely affect our ability to perform the impacted contracts. For example, since April 2021, we have\nreceived multiple denials from the U.S. Department of State for export, import and manufacturing licenses pertaining to TUHP. These denials prevent us from performing\ncertain significant obligations under contracts for TUHP, which has and will affect our sales and impact our ability to recover certain costs. As a result of these license\ndenials, we have provided force majeure notices under the affected contracts and these contracts may be restructured or terminated, which could result in a further reduction\nin sales, the imposition of penalties or assessment of damages, and increased unrecoverable costs. In addition, we have other programs where we work with Turkish\nindustry, including for domestic U.S. Black Hawk® helicopter production, that rely on components from Turkish suppliers. While thes",

Our main areas of focus are in defense, space, intelligence, homeland security and information\ntechnology, including cybersecurity.\nWe operate in four business segments: Aeronautics, Missiles and Fire Control (MFC), Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) and Space. We organize our business\nsegments based on the nature of the products and services offered.\nWe operate in an environment characterized by both complexity in global security and continuing economic pressures in the U.S. and globally. A significant\ncomponent of our strategy in this environment is to focus on program execution, improving the quality and predictability of the delivery of our products and services, and\nplacing security capability quickly into the hands of our U.S. and international customers at affordable prices. Recognizing that our customers are resource constrained, we\nplace considerable focus on affordability initiatives while endeavoring to develop and extend our portfolio domestically in a disciplined manner, with a focus on adjacent\nmarkets close to our core capabilities as well as growing our international sales.

As of December 31, 2021, more than 96% of our U.S. employee population had been vaccinated or received an approved\nexception.

The long-\nterm impacts of COVID-19 on government budgets and other funding priorities, including international priorities, that impact demand for our products and services are also\ndifficult to predict but could negatively affect our future results and performance.\n2022 Financial Trends\nWe expect 2022 net sales to decrease by approximately 2% from 2021 levels. The projected decline is driven by declines at three of the four business areas (MFC,\nRMS, and Space). Specifically, these decreases are driven by the renationalization of the Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE) at Space, the 2021 delivery of a training\nsystem on an international pilot training program at RMS not projected to repeat in 2022, as well as a decrease in Special Operations Forces Global Logistics Support\nServices (SOF GLSS) volume at MFC due to withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan. Total business segment operating margin in 2022 is expected to be\napproximately 10.9% and cash from operations in 2022 is expected to be greater than or equal to $7.9 billion. Cash from operations assumes no pension contributions; and\nincludes an estimated potential impact in 2022 of approximately $500 million from the provisions in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that went into effect on January 1,\n2022 eliminating the option to immediately deduct research and development expenditures in the period incurred and requiring companies to amortize such expenditures\nover five years. The actual impact on 2022 cash from operations will depend on if and when these provisions are deferred, modified, or repealed by Congress, including if\nretroactively, and the amount of research and development expenses paid or incurred in 2022 among other factors. See “Income Tax Expense” below and Item 1A. Risk\nFactors for additional information regarding potential impacts of changes in tax laws and regulations, including the treatment of research and development costs.\nThe outlook for 2022 also assumes continued support and funding of our programs, a U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21%, known impacts of COVID-19, and the\ncontinued acceleration of supplier payments, with a focus on small and at-risk businesses. No additional impacts to the company’s operations, supply chain, or financial\nresults as a result of continued COVID-19 disruption have been incorporated into our outlook for 2022 as the company cannot predict how the pandemic will evolve or\nwhat impact it will continue to have.

In the coming\nmonths, Congress will need to approve or revise the President’s FY 2022 budget proposal through enactment of appropriations bills and other policy\n34\n\n\nTable of Contents\nlegislation, which would then require final approval from the President in order for the FY 2022 budget to become law and complete the budget process.\nAdditionally, on December 16, 2021, the President signed legislation increasing the federal debt limit by $2.5 trillion. The measure increases the debt limit to $31.4\ntrillion from the previous level of $28.9 trillion and is estimated to provide sufficient government borrowing capacity to last until early 2023.\nInternational Business\nA key component of our strategic plan is to grow our international sales. To accomplish this growth, we continue to focus on strengthening our relationships\ninternationally through partnerships and joint technology efforts. Our international business is conducted either by foreign military sales (FMS) contracted through the U.S.\nGovernment or by direct commercial sales (DCS) to international customers. In 2021, approximately 69% of our sales to international customers were FMS and about 31%\nwere DCS. See Item 1A - Risk Factors for a discussion of risks related to international sales.\nIn 2021, international customers accounted for 35% of Aeronautics’ net sales. There continues to be strong international interest in the F-35 program, which includes\ncommitments from the U.S. Government and seven international partner countries and six international customers, as well as expressions of interest from other countries.\nThe U.S. Government and the partner countries continue to work together on the design, testing, production, and sustainment of the F-35 program. Other areas of\ninternational expansion at our Aeronautics business segment include the F-16 and C-130J programs, which continue to draw interest from international customers for new\naircraft.\nIn 2021, international customers accounted for 29% of MFC’s net sales.

Production of the aircraft is expected to continue\nfor many years given the U.S. Government’s current inventory objective of 2,456 aircraft for the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Marine Corps, and U.S. Navy; commitments from our\nseven international partner countries and six international customers; as well as expressions of interest from other countries.\n35\n\n\nTable of Contents\nDuring 2021, the F-35 program completed several milestones both domestically and internationally. The U.S. Government continued testing the aircraft, including\nship trials, mission and weapons systems evaluations, and the F-35 fleet recently surpassed 470,000 flight hours. During the second half of 2021, the U.S. Government\nawarded the production of 16 F-35 Lot 15 aircraft in addition to the 967 aircraft previously awarded. Since program inception, we have delivered 753 production F-35\naircraft to U.S. and international customers, including 549 F-35A variants, 150 F-35B variants, and 54 F-35C variants, demonstrating the F-35 program’s continued\nprogress and longevity.\nIn response to COVID-19 F-35 delays and in conjunction with the F-35 Joint Program Office (JPO), we tapered our production rate in 2020. In 2021, we continued to\nbe impacted by COVID-19 but the production rate improved from its 2020 levels. In September 2021, the F-35 JPO and the Lockheed Martin industry team agreed on an F-\n35 production rebaseline that ensures predictability and stability in the production process while recovering the aircraft shortfall realized over the last year during the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. With this agreement, we were scheduled to deliver 133-139 aircraft in 2021. However, we delivered 142 aircraft in 2021, exceeding our contractual\nobligation by three aircraft. We anticipate delivering 148-153 aircraft in 2022. In 2023 and beyond, we anticipate delivering 156 aircraft for the foreseeable future. We have\n230 aircraft in backlog as of December 31, 2021 extending into 2023, including orders from our international partner countries.\nGiven the size and complexity of the F-35 program, we anticipate that there will be continual reviews related to aircraft performance, program schedule, cost, and\nrequirements as part of the DoD, Congressional, and international countries’ oversight and budgeting processes. Current program challenges include supplier, Lockheed\nMartin and partner performance (including COVID-19 performance-related challenges), software development, the receipt of funding for contracts on a timely basis,\nexecution of future flight tests and findings resulting from testing and operating the aircraft, the level of cost associated with life cycle operations, sustainment and potential\ncontractual obligations, and the ability to continue to reduce the unit production costs and improve affordability.\nBacklog\nAt December 31, 2021, our backlog was $135.4 billion compared with ",

The increase was primarily attributable to higher product sales of approximately\n$735 million at RMS due to higher production volume on various Sikorsky helicopter programs and for training and logistics solutions (TLS) programs due to the delivery\nof an international pilot training system; $465 million at MFC due to higher volume on PAC-3, Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM) and Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff\nMissile (JASSM) programs; and $305 million at Aeronautics due to higher volume on classified contracts and F-16 production contracts, partially offset by lower volume\non F-35 development contracts.\nService Sales\nService sales increased $139 million, or 1%, in 2021 as compared to 2020. The increase in service sales was primarily attributable to higher sales of approximately\n$180 million at Aeronautics due to higher sustainment volume on F-35, partially offset by lower sustainment volume on F-22.\nCost of Sales\nCost of sales, for both products and services, consist of materials, labor, subcontracting costs and an allocation of indirect costs (overhead and general and\nadministrative), as well as the costs to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, required under certain contracts with\ninternational customers.

See “Note 12 – Postretirement Benefit Plans” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe following segment discussions also include information relating to backlog for each segment. Backlog was approximately $135.4 billion and $147.1 billion at\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020. These amounts included both funded backlog (firm orders for which funding has been both authorized and appropriated by the customer) and\nunfunded backlog (firm orders for which funding has not yet been appropriated). Backlog does not include unexercised options or task orders to be issued under indefinite-\ndelivery, indefinite-quantity contracts. Funded backlog was approximately $88.5 billion at December 31, 2021, as compared to $102.3 billion at December 31, 2020. If any\nof our contracts with firm orders were to be terminated, our backlog would be reduced by the expected value of the unfilled orders of such contracts.\nManagement evaluates performance on our contracts by focusing on net sales and operating profit and not by type or amount of operating expense. Consequently, our\ndiscussion of business segment performance focuses on net sales and operating profit, consistent with our approach for managing the business. This approach is consistent\nthroughout the life cycle of our contracts, as management assesses the bidding of each contract by focusing on net sales and operating profit and monitors performance on\nour contracts in a similar manner through their completion.\nWe regularly provide customers with reports of our costs as the contract progresses. The cost information in the reports is accumulated in a manner specified by the\nrequirements of each contract. For example, cost data provided to a customer for a pr",

          "chunk": " a customer for a product would typically align to the subcomponents of that product (such as a wing-box\non an aircraft) and for services would align to the type of work being performed (such as aircraft sustainment). Our contracts generally allow for the recovery of costs in the\npricing of our products and services. Most of our contracts are bid and negotiated with our customers under circumstances in which we are required to disclose our\nestimated total costs to provide the product or service. This approach for negotiating contracts with our U.S. Government customers generally allows for recovery of our\nactual costs plus a reasonable profit margin. We also may enter into long-term supply contracts for certain materials or components to coincide with the production schedule\nof certain products and to ensure their availability at known unit prices.\nMany of our contracts span several years and include highly complex technical requirements. At the outset of a contract, we identify and monitor risks to the\nachievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract and assess the effects of those risks on our estimates of total costs to complete the contract. The\nestimates consider the technical requirements (e.g., a newly-developed product versus a mature product), the schedule and associated tasks (e.g., the number and type of\nmilestone events) and costs (e.g., material, labor, subcontractor, overhead and the estimated costs to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as\noffset agreements, required under certain contracts with international customers). The initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the ability to\nachieve the technical requirements, schedule and costs in the initial estimated total costs to complete the contract. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance\nof the contract if we successfully retire risks related to the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract, which decreases the estimated total costs to complete the\ncontract. Conversely, our profit booking rates may decrease if the estimated total costs to complete the contract increase. All of the estimates are subject to change during\nthe performance of the contract and may affect the profit booking rate.\n43\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWe have a number of programs that are designated as classified by the U.S. Government which cannot be specifically described. The operating results of these\nclassified programs are included in our consolidated and business segment results and are subjected to the same oversight and internal controls as our other programs.\nOur net sales are primarily derived from long-term contracts for products and services provided to the U.S. Government as well as FMS contracted through the U.S.\nGovernment.

For performance obligations in which control does not continuously transfer to the customer, we recognize revenue at the point in time in\nwhich each performance obligation is fully satisfied. Lower than expected supply chain activity negatively affected our net sales during 2021.\nChanges in net sales and operating profit generally are expressed in terms of volume. Changes in volume refer to increases or decreases in sales or operating profit\nresulting from varying production activity levels, deliveries or service levels on individual contracts. Volume changes in segment operating profit are typically based on the\ncurrent profit booking rate for a particular contract.\nIn addition, comparability of our segment sales, operating profit and operating margin may be impacted favorably or unfavorably by changes in profit booking rates on\nour contracts for which we recognize revenue over time using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method to measure progress towards completion. Increases in the\nprofit booking rates, typically referred to as risk retirements, usually relate to revisions in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations that reflect\nimproved conditions on a particular contract. Conversely, conditions on a particular contract may deteriorate, resulting in an increase in the estimated total costs to fulfill\nthe performance obligations and a reduction in the profit booking rate. Increases or decreases in profit booking rates are recognized in the period they are determined and\nreflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. Segment operating profit and margin may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other items, which may or may\nnot impact sales. Favorable items may include the positive resolution of contractual matters, cost recoveries on severance and restructuring charges, insurance recoveries\nand gains on sales of assets. Unfavorable items may include the adverse resolution of contractual matters; restructuring charges, except for significant severance actions,\nwhich are excluded from segment operating results; reserves for disputes; certain asset impairments; and losses on sales of certain assets.\nOur consolidated net adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters, increased segment operating profit by\napproximately $2.0 billion in 2021 and $1.8 billion in 2020.

We generally do not begin work on contracts until funding is appropriated by the customer. However, we may determine to fund\ncustomer programs ourselves pending government appropriations. If we incur costs in excess of funds obligated on the contract, we may be at risk for reimbursement of the\nexcess costs.\nBilling timetables and payment terms on our contracts vary based on a number of factors, including the contract type. We generally bill and collect cash more\nfrequently under cost-reimbursable contracts, which represented approximately 38% of the sales we recorded in 2021, as we are authorized to bill as the costs are incurred.\nA number of our fixed-price contracts may provide for performance-based payments, which allow us to bill and collect cash as we perform on the contract. The amount of\nperformance-based payments and the related milestones are encompassed in the negotiation of each contract. The timing of such payments may differ from the timing of\nthe costs incurred related to our contract performance, thereby affecting our cash flows.\nThe U.S. Government has indicated that it would consider progress payments as the baseline for negotiating payment terms on fixed-price contracts, rather than\nperformance-based payments. In contrast to negotiated performance-based payment terms, progress payment provisions correspond to a percentage of the amount of costs\nincurred during the performance of the contract and are invoiced regularly as costs are incurred. In March 2020, the DoD increased the percentage rate for certain progress\npayments from 80% to 90%. Our cash flows may be affected if the U.S. Government changes its payment policies or decides to withhold payments on our billings. While\nthe impact of policy changes or withholding payments may delay the receipt of cash, the cumulative amount of cash collected during the life of the contract should not vary.\nWe have a balanced cash deployment strategy to invest in our business and key technologies to provide our customers with enhanced capabilities, enhance stockholder\nvalue, and position ourselves to take advantage of new business opportunities when they arise. Consistent with that strategy, we have continued to invest in our business\nand technologies through capital expenditures, independent research and development, and selective business acquisitions and investments. We have returned cash to\nstockholders through dividends and share repurchases. We also continue to actively manage our debt levels, including maturities and interest rates, and our pension\nobligations.

These increases in cash from operations were partially offset by an increase of approximately $720\nmillion in payroll taxes and an increase of about $100 million in accelerated payments to our supply chain. During 2021, we paid employer payroll taxes of $942 million,\ncompared to $222 million during 2020. The increase in employer payroll taxes was due to the deferral of $460 million of payments in 2020, half of which were paid in the\nfourth quarter of 2021 and half of which will be paid in the fourth quarter of 2022, pursuant to the CARES Act.

The standalone selling price represents the amount we would sell the product or service to a customer on\na standalone basis (i.e., not bundled with any other products or services). Our contracts with the U.S. Government, including FMS contracts, are subject to FAR and the\nprice is typically based on estimated or actual costs plus a reasonable profit margin.

Government and FMS contracts are typically equal to the selling price stated in the contract.\nFor non-U.S. Government contracts with multiple performance obligations, we evaluate whether the stated selling prices for the products or services represent their\nstandalone selling prices. We primarily sell customized solutions unique to a customer’s specifications. When it is necessary to allocate the transaction price to multiple\nperformance obligations, we typically use the expected cost plus a reasonable profit margin to estimate the standalone selling price of each product or service. We\noccasionally sell standard products or services with observable standalone sales transactions. In these situations, the observable standalone sales transactions are used to\ndetermine the standalone selling price.\nWe recognize revenue as performance obligations are satisfied and the customer obtains control of the products and services. In determining when performance\nobligations are satisfied, we consider factors such as contract terms, payment terms and whether there is an alternative future use of the product or service. Substantially all\nof our revenue is recognized over time as we perform under the contract because control of the work in process transfers continuously to the customer. For most contracts\nwith the U.S. Government and FMS contracts, this continuous transfer of control of the work in process to the customer is supported by clauses in the contract that give the\ncustomer ownership of work in process and allow the customer to unilaterally terminate the contract for convenience and pay us for costs incurred plus a reasonable profit.\nFor most non-U.S. Government contracts, primarily international direct commercial contracts, continuous transfer of control to our customer is supported because we\ndeliver products that do not have an alternative use to us and if our customer were to terminate the contract for reasons other than our non-performance we would have the\nright to recover damages which would include, among other potential damages, the right to payment for our work performed to date plus a reasonable profit.\n53\n\n\nTable of Contents\nFor performance obligations to deliver products with continuous transfer of control to the customer, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards\ncompletion of the performance obligation, generally using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress for our contracts because it best depicts the\ntransfer of control to the customer as we incur costs on our contracts. Under the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress, the extent of progress towards\ncompletion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs to complete the performance obligation(s).

At the outset of a long-term contract, we\nidentify and monitor risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract, as well as variable consideration, and assess the effects of those\nrisks on our estimates of sales and total costs to complete the contract. The estimates consider the technical requirements (e.g., a newly-developed product versus a mature\nproduct), the schedule and associated tasks (e.g., the number and type of milestone events) and costs (e.g., material, labor, subcontractor, overhead, general and\nadministrative and the estimated costs to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset or localization agreements, required under certain\ncontracts with international customers). The initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements,\nschedule and costs in the initial estimated total costs to complete the contract. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully\nretire risks surrounding the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract, which decreases the estimated total costs to complete the contract or may increase the\nvariable consideration we expect to receive on the contract. Conversely, our profit booking rates may decrease if the estimated total costs to complete the contract increase\nor our estimates of variable consideration we expect to receive decrease. All of the estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect\nthe profit booking rate. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of the transaction price, a provision for the entire loss is determined\nat the contract level and is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined.\nComparability of our segment sales, operating profit and operating margin may be impacted favorably or unfavorably by changes in profit booking rates on our\ncontracts for which we recognize revenue over time using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method to measure progress towards completion.

Cost-based\npricing is determined under the FAR. The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services under U.S.\nGovernment contracts. For example, costs such as those related to charitable contributions, interest expense and certain advertising and public relations activities are\nunallowable and, therefore, not recoverable through sales. In addition, we may enter into advance agreements with the U.S. Government that address the subjects of\nallowability and allocability of costs to contracts for specific matters. For example, most of the environmental costs we incur for environmental remediation related to sites\noperated in prior years are allocated to our current operations as general and administrative costs under FAR provisions and supporting advance agreements reached with\nthe U.S. Government.\nWe closely monitor compliance with and the consistent application of our critical accounting policies related to contract accounting.

On August 3, 2021, we purchased GACs to transfer $4.9 billion of gross defined benefit pension\nobligations and related plan assets to an insurance company for approximately 18,000 U.S. retirees and beneficiaries.

The amounts we record are measured\nusing actuarial valuations, which are dependent upon key assumptions such as discount rates, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, participant longevity, and\nemployee turnover. The assumptions we make affect both the calculation of the benefit obligations as of the measurement date and the calculation of FAS expense in\nsubsequent periods. When reassessing these assumptions, we consider past and current market conditions and make judgments about future market trends.

The long-term rate of return assumption represents the expected long-term rate of\nreturn on the funds invested or to be invested, to provide for the benefits included in the benefit obligations. This assumption is based on several factors including historical\nmarket index returns, the anticipated long-term allocation of plan assets, the historical return data for the trust funds, plan expenses and the potential to outperform market\nindex returns. The difference between the long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption we select and the actual return on plan assets in any given year affects both the\nfunded status of our benefit plans and the calculation of FAS pension expense in subsequent periods. Although the actual return in any specific year likely will differ from\nthe assumption, the average expected return over a long-term future horizon should be approximately equal to the assumption. Any variance each year should not, by itself,\nsuggest that the assumption should be changed. Patterns of variances are reviewed over time, and then combined with expectations for the future. As a result, changes in\nthis assumption are less frequent than changes in the discount rate. The actual investment return for our qualified defined benefit plans during 2021 of $3.9 billion, based on\nan actual rate of approximately 10.5%, improved plan assets more than the $2.1 billion expected return based on our long-term rate of return assumption.\nIn October 2021, the Society of Actuaries published revised longevity assumptions that refined its prior studies.

Our\ngoodwill has been allocated to and is tested for impairment at a level referred to as the reporting unit, which is our business segment level or a level below the business\nsegment. The level at which we test goodwill for impairment requires us to determine whether the operations below the business segment constitute a self-sustaining\nbusiness for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results.\nWe may use both qualitative and quantitative approaches when testing goodwill for impairment. For selected reporting units where we use the qualitative approach, we\nperform a qualitative evaluation of events and circumstances impacting the reporting unit to determine the likelihood of goodwill impairment. Based on that qualitative\nevaluation, if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, no further evaluation is necessary. Otherwise, we\nperform a quantitative impairment test. We perform quantitative tests for most reporting units at least once every three years. However, for certain reporting units we may\nperform a quantitative impairment test every year.\nTo perform the quantitative impairment test, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit\nexceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. If the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, a goodwill\nimpairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. We generally estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of a discounted cash flow\n(DCF) analysis and market-based valuation methodologies such as comparable public company trading values and values observed in recent business acquisitions.\nDetermining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgments, including the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, long-term growth rates, discount rates\nand relevant comparable public company earnings multiples and relevant transaction multiples. The cash flows employed in the DCF analysis are based on our best\nestimate of future sales, earnings and cash flows after considering factors such as general market conditions, U.S. Government budgets, existing firm orders, expected\nfuture orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements, changes in working capital, long term business plans and recent operating performance. The discount rates utilized\nin the DCF analysis are based on the respective reporting unit’s weighted average cost of capital, which takes into account the relative weights of each component of capital\nstructure (equity and debt) and represents the expected cost of new capital, adjusted as appropriate to consider the risk inherent in future cash flows of the respective\nreporting unit.

As of the date of our annual impairment test, the fair value of our Sikorsky reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, which\nincluded goodwill of $2.7 billion, by a margin of approximately 30%. The fair value of our Sikorsky reporting unit can be significantly impacted by its performance, the\namount and timing of expected future cash flows, contract terminations, changes in expected future orders, general market pressures, including U.S. Government budgetary\nconstraints, discount rates, long term growth rates, and changes in U.S. (federal or state) or foreign tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application,\nincluding those with retroactive effect, along with other significant judgments. Based on our assessment of these circumstances, we have determined that goodwill at our\nSikorsky reporting unit remains at risk for impairment should there be a deterioration of projected cash flows of the reporting unit.\nImpairment assessments inherently involve management judgments regarding a number of assumptions such as those described above. Due to the many variables\ninherent in the estimation of a reporting unit’s fair value and the relative size of our recorded goodwill, differences in assumptions could have a material effect on the\nestimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period.\n59\n\n\nTable of Contents\nAcquired intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to annual impairment testing.

We believe that they provide us with sufficient access\nto the general and trade credit we require to conduct our business. We continue to closely monitor the financial market environment and actively manage counterparty\nexposure to minimize the potential impact from adverse developments with any single credit provider while ensuring availability of, and access to, sufficient credit\nresources.\nOur main exposure to market risk relates to interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and market prices on certain equity securities. Our financial instruments that\nare subject to interest rate risk principally include fixed-rate long-term debt and commercial paper, if issued. The estimated fair value of our outstanding debt was\n$15.4 billion at December 31, 2021 and the outstanding principal amount was $12.8 billion, excluding unamortized discounts and issuance costs of $1.1 billion. A 10%\nchange in the level of interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of our outstanding debt at December 31, 2021.\nWe use derivative instruments principally to reduce our exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We do not enter\ninto or hold derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes. We transact business globally and are subject to risks associated with changing foreign currency\nexchange rates. We enter into foreign currency hedges such as forward and option contracts that change in value as foreign currency exchange rates change. Our most\nsignificant foreign currency exposures relate to the British pound sterling, the euro, the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar, the Norwegian Kroner and the Polish Zloty.\nThese contracts hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions in order to mitigate fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency\nexchange rates. We designate foreign currency hedges as cash flow hedges. We also are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes primarily through our borrowing\nactivities. For fixed rate borrowings, we may use variable interest rate swaps, effectively converting fixed rate borrowings to variable rate borrowings in order to hedge\nchanges in the fair value of the debt. These swaps are designated as fair value hedges.

We serve both U.S. and international customers with products and services that have defense, civil and commercial applications, with our principal\ncustomers being agencies of the U.S. Government. As described in “Note 4 – Information on Business Segments”, we operate in four business segments: Aeronautics,\nMFC, RMS and Space.\nOn June 30, 2021, the UK Ministry of Defence terminated the contract to operate the UK’s nuclear deterrent program and assumed control of the entity that manages\nthe program (referred to as the renationalization of the Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE program)). Accordingly, the AWE program’s ongoing operations, including\nthe entity that manages the program, are no longer included in our financial results as of that date, however, during 2021, AWE generated sales of $885 million and\noperating profit of $18 million, which are included in Space’s financial results for the year ended December 31, 2021.

We classify certain assets and liabilities as current utilizing the duration of the related\ncontract or program as our operating cycle, which is generally longer than one year. This primarily impacts receivables, contract assets, inventories, and contract liabilities.\nWe classify all other assets and liabilities based on whether the asset will be realized or the liability will be paid within one year.\nUse of estimates – We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In doing so, we are\nrequired to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base these estimates on\nhistorical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments\nabout the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our actual results may differ materially from these estimates.\nSignificant estimates inherent in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, accounting for sales and cost recognition;\npostretirement benefit plans; environmental liabilities and assets for the portion of environmental costs that are probable of future recovery; evaluation of goodwill,\nintangible assets, investments and other assets for impairment; income taxes including deferred income taxes; fair value measurements; and contingencies.\nRevenue Recognition – The majority of our net sales are generated from long-term contracts with the U.S. Government and international customers (including foreign\nmilitary sales (FMS) contracted through the U.S. Government) for the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology\nsystems, products and services. We account for a contract when it has approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are\nidentified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. For certain contracts that meet the foregoing requirements, primarily\ninternational direct commercial sale contracts, we are required to obtain certain regulatory approvals. In these cases, we recognize revenue when it is probable that we will\nreceive regulatory approvals based upon all known facts and circumstances. We provide our products and services under fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts.\nUnder fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform the specified work for a pre-determined price. To the extent our actual costs vary from the estimates upon which the\nprice was negotiated, we will generate more or less profit or could incur a loss.

Typically, we enter into three types of cost-reimbursable contracts: cost-plus-award-fee, cost-plus-incentive-fee, and cost-plus-fixed-fee. Cost-plus-award-\nfee contracts provide for an award fee that varies within specified limits based on the customer’s assessment of our performance against a predetermined set of criteria, such\nas targets based on cost, quality, technical and schedule criteria. Cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fee, which is adjusted by a\nformula based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs (i.e., incentive based on cost) or reimbursement of costs plus an incentive to exceed stated\nperformance targets (i.e.,\n71\n\n\nTable of Contents\nincentive based on performance). Cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts provide a fixed fee that is negotiated at the inception of the contract and does not vary with actual costs.\nWe assess each contract at its inception to determine whether it should be combined with other contracts. When making this determination, we consider factors such\nas whether two or more contracts were negotiated and executed at or near the same time or were negotiated with an overall profit objective. If combined, we treat the\ncombined contracts as a single contract for revenue recognition purposes.\nWe evaluate the products or services promised in each contract at inception to determine whether the contract should be accounted for as having one or more\nperformance obligations. The products and services in our contracts are typically not distinct from one another due to their complex relationships and the significant\ncontract management functions required to perform under the contract. Accordingly, our contracts are typically accounted for as one performance obligation. In limited\ncases, our contracts have more than one distinct performance obligation, which occurs when we perform activities that are not highly complex or interrelated or involve\ndifferent product lifecycles. Significant judgment is required in determining performance obligations, and these decisions could change the amount of revenue and profit\nrecorded in a given period. We classify net sales as products or services on our consolidated statements of earnings based on the predominant attributes of the performance\nobligations.\nWe determine the transaction price for each contract based on the consideration we expect to receive for the products or services being provided under the contract.\nFor contracts where a portion of the price may vary, we estimate variable consideration at the most likely amount, which is included in the transaction price to the extent it\nis probable that a significant rev",

We analyze the risk of a significant revenue reversal and if necessary constrain the\namount of variable consideration recognized in order to mitigate this risk.\nAt the inception of a contract we estimate the transaction price based on our current rights and do not contemplate future modifications (including unexercised\noptions) or follow-on contracts until they become legally enforceable. Contracts are often subsequently modified to include changes in specifications, requirements or price,\nwhich may create new or change existing enforceable rights and obligations. Depending on the nature of the modification, we consider whether to account for the\nmodification as an adjustment to the existing contract or as a separate contract. Generally, modifications to our contracts are not distinct from the existing contract due to\nthe significant integration and interrelated tasks provided in the context of the contract. Therefore, such modifications are accounted for as if they were part of the existing\ncontract and recognized as a cumulative adjustment to revenue.\nFor contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on the estimated standalone selling price\nof the product or service underlying each performance obligation. The standalone selling price represents the amount we would sell the product or service to a customer on\na standalone basis (i.e., not bundled with any other products or services). Our contracts with the U.S. Government, including FMS contracts, are subject to the Federal\nAcquisition Regulations (FAR) and the price is typically based on estimated or actual costs plus a reasonable profit margin. As a result of these regulations, the standalone\nselling price of products or services in our contracts with the U.S. Government and FMS contracts are typically equal to the selling price stated in the contract.\nFor non-U.S. Government contracts with multiple performance obligations, we evaluate whether the stated selling prices for the products or services represent their\nstandalone selling prices. We primarily sell customized solutions unique to a customer’s specifications. When it is necessary to allocate the transaction price to multiple\nperformance obligations, we typically use the expected cost plus a reasonable profit margin to estimate the standalone selling price of each product or service. We\noccasionally sell standard products or services with observable standalone sales transactions. In these situations, the observable standalone sales transactions are used to\ndetermine the standalone selling price.\nWe recognize revenue as performance obligations are satisfied and the customer obtains control of the products and services.

For most contracts\nwith the U.S. Government and FMS contracts, this continuous transfer of control of the work in process to the customer is supported by clauses in the contract that give the\ncustomer ownership of work in process and allow the customer to unilaterally terminate the contract for convenience and pay us for costs incurred plus a reasonable profit.\nFor most non-U.S. Government contracts, primarily international direct commercial contracts, continuous transfer of control to our customer is supported because we\ndeliver products that do not have an alternative use to us and if our customer were to terminate the contract for reasons other than our non-performance we would have the\nright to recover damages which would include, among other potential damages, the right to payment for our work performed to date plus a reasonable profit.\n72\n\n\nTable of Contents\nFor performance obligations to deliver products with continuous transfer of control to the customer, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards\ncompletion of the performance obligation, generally using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress for our contracts because it best depicts the\ntransfer of control to the customer as we incur costs on our contracts. Under the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress, the extent of progress towards\ncompletion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs to complete the performance obligation(s). For performance obligations to\nprovide services to the customer, revenue is recognized over time based on costs incurred or the right to invoice method (in situations where the value transferred matches\nour billing rights) as our customer receives and consumes the benefits.\nFor performance obligations in which control does not continuously transfer to the customer, we recognize revenue at the point in time in which each performance\nobligation is fully satisfied. This coincides with the point in time the customer obtains control of the product or service, which typically occurs upon customer acceptance or\nreceipt of the product or service, given that we maintain control of the product or service until that point.\nBacklog (i.e., unfulfilled or remaining performance obligations) represents the sales we expect to recognize for our products and services for which control has not yet\ntransferred to the customer.

In determining the estimated consideration, we consider the risks\nrelated to the technical, schedule and cost impacts to complete the contract and an estimate of any variable consideration. Periodically, we review these risks and may\nincrease or decrease backlog accordingly. As the risks on such contracts are successfully retired, the estimated consideration from customers may be reduced, resulting in a\nreduction of backlog without a corresponding recognition of sales. As of December 31, 2021, our ending backlog was $135.4 billion. We expect to recognize approximately\n38% of our backlog over the next 12 months and approximately 60% over the next 24 months as revenue, with the remainder recognized thereafter.\nFor arrangements with the U.S. Government and FMS contracts, we generally do not begin work on contracts until funding is appropriated by the customer. Billing\ntimetables and payment terms on our contracts vary based on a number of factors, including the contract type. Typical payment terms under fixed-price contracts with the\nU.S. Government provide that the customer pays either performance-based payments (PBPs) based on the achievement of contract milestones or progress payments based\non a percentage of costs we incur. For the majority of our international direct commercial contracts to deliver complex systems, we typically receive advance payments\nprior to commencement of work, as well as milestone payments that are paid in accordance with the terms of our contract as we perform. We recognize a liability for\npayments in excess of revenue recognized, which is presented as a contract liability on the balance sheet. The portion of payments retained by the customer until final\ncontract settlement is not considered a significant financing component because the intent is to protect the customer from our failure to adequately complete some or all of\nthe obligations under the contract. Payments received from customers in advance of revenue recognition are not considered to be significant financing components because\nthey are used to meet working capital demands that can be higher in the early stages of a contract.\nFor fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts, we present revenues recognized in excess of billings as contract assets on the balance sheet. Amounts billed and due\nfrom our customers under both contract types are classified as receivables on the balance sheet.\nSignificant estimates and assumptions are made in estimating contract sales and costs, including the profit booking rate. At the outset of a long-term contract, we\nidentify and monitor risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract, as well as variable consideration, and assess the effects of those\nrisks on our estimates of sales and total costs to complete the contract.

The initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements,\nschedule and costs in the initial estimated total costs to complete the contract. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully\nretire risks surrounding the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract, which decreases the estimated total costs to complete the contract or may increase the\nvariable consideration we expect to receive on the contract.

Increases or decreases in profit booking rates are recognized in the period they are determined and\nreflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. Segment operating profit and margin may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other items, which may or may\nnot impact sales. Favorable items may include the positive resolution of contractual matters, cost recoveries on severance and restructuring charges, insurance recoveries\nand gains on sales of assets.

The provision for income taxes differs from the amounts currently receivable or payable because\ncertain items of income and expense are recognized in different periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes. We measure deferred tax assets and\nliabilities using enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to be recovered or paid.\nWe periodically assess our tax exposures related to periods that are open to examination. Based on the latest available information, we evaluate our tax positions to\ndetermine whether the position will more likely than not be sustained upon examination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) or other taxing authorities. If we cannot\nreach a more-likely-than-not determination, no benefit is recorded. If we determine that the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, we record the largest\namount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized when the tax position is settled. We record interest and penalties related to income taxes as a component of\nincome tax expense on our consolidated statements of earnings.

Contract assets are recorded at the net amount expected to be billed and\ncollected. Contract assets are classified as current based on our contract operating cycle, and include amounts that may be billed and collected beyond one year due to the\nlong-cycle nature of our contracts.\n75\n\n\nTable of Contents\nInventories – We record inventories at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value. The majority of our inventory represents work-in-process for contracts\nwhere control has not yet passed to the customer. Work-in-process primarily consists of labor, material, subcontractor, and overhead costs. In addition, costs incurred to\nfulfill a contract in advance of the contract being awarded are recorded in inventories as work-in-process if we determine that those costs relate directly to a contract or to\nan anticipated contract that we can specifically identify and contract award is probable, the costs generate or enhance resources that will be used in satisfying performance\nobligations, and the costs are recoverable (referred to as pre-contract costs). Pre-contract costs that are initially capitalized in inventory are generally recognized as cost of\nsales consistent with the transfer of products and services to the customer upon the receipt of the anticipated contract. All other pre-contract costs, including start-up costs,\nare expensed as incurred. We determine the costs of other inventories such as materials, spares and supplies by using the first-in first-out or average cost methods. If events\nor changes in circumstances indicate that precontract costs are no longer recoverable or the utility of our inventories have diminished through damage, deterioration,\nobsolescence, changes in price or other causes, a loss is recognized in the period in which it occurs.\nContract liabilities – Contract liabilities include advance payments and billings in excess of revenue recognized. Contract liabilities are classified as current based on\nour contract operating cycle and reported on a contract-by-contract basis, net of revenue recognized, at the end of each reporting period.\nProperty, plant and equipment – Property, plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost.

We assess impairment by comparing the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the related asset grouping to its carrying amount. If an asset is determined\nto be impaired, we recognize an impairment charge in the current period for the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying amount.\nCapitalized software – We capitalize certain costs associated with the development or purchase of internal-use software. The amounts capitalized are included in other\nnoncurrent assets on our consolidated balance sheets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the resulting software, which ranges from\ntwo to six years.

Goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses. Intangible assets\nfrom acquired businesses are recognized at fair value on the acquisition date and consist of customer programs, trademarks, customer relationships, technology and other\nintangible assets. Customer programs include values assigned to major programs of acquired businesses and represent the aggregate value associated with the customer\nrelationships, contracts, technology and trademarks underlying the associated program.

We perform an impairment test of our goodwill at least annually in the fourth quarter or\nmore frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired. Such events or changes in circumstances may\ninclude a significant deterioration in overall economic conditions, changes in the business climate of our industry, a decline in our market capitalization, operating\nperformance indicators, competition, reorganizations of our business, U.S. Government budget restrictions or the disposal of all or a portion of a reporting unit. Our\ngoodwill has been allocated to and is tested for impairment at a level referred to as the reporting unit, which is our business segment level or a level below the business\nsegment. The level at which we test goodwill for impairment requires us to determine whether the operations below the business segment constitute a self-sustaining\nbusiness for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results.\nWe may use either a qualitative or quantitative approach when testing a reporting unit’s goodwill for impairment. For selected reporting units where we use the\nqualitative approach, we perform a qualitative evaluation of events and circumstances impacting the reporting unit to determine the likelihood of goodwill impairment.\nBased on that qualitative evaluation, if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, no further evaluation is\nnecessary.

This announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis is not guaranteed after 2021.

(Aerojet Rocketdyne) for $51.00 per share, which is net of a $5.00\nper share special cash dividend Aerojet Rocketdyne paid to its stockholders on March 24, 2021. At the time of announcement, this represented a post-dividend equity value\nof approximately $4.6 billion, on a fully diluted as-converted basis, and a transaction value of approximately $4.4 billion after the assumption of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s\nthen-projected net cash. If the transaction is completed, we expect to finance the acquisition primarily through new debt issuances. The transaction was approved by Aerojet\nRocketdyne’s stockholders on March 9, 2021. As part of the regulatory review process of the transaction, on September 24, 2021, we and Aerojet Rocketdyne each certified\nsubstantial compliance with the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) requests for additional information, known as a “second request.” On January 11, 2022, the parties\nprovided an updated notice of their intended closing date under their timing agreement with the FTC, whereby the parties agreed that they would not close the transaction\nbefore January 27, 2022, to enable the parties to discuss the scope and nature of the merchant supply and firewall commitments previously offered to the FTC by Lockheed\nMartin.

We believe it is highly\nlikely that the FTC will vote to sue to block the transaction and expect they will make a decision before January 27, 2022. If the FTC sues to block the transaction, we\ncould elect to defend the lawsuit within 30 days or terminate the merger agreement.

Substantially all of our postretirement benefit obligations relate to U.S. based defined\nbenefit pension plans and retiree medical and life insurance plans. The majority of our U.S. defined benefit pension plans provide for benefits within limits imposed by\nfederal tax law (referred to as qualified plans). However, certain of our U.S. defined benefit pension plans provide for benefits in excess of qualified plan limits imposed by\nfederal tax law (referred to as nonqualified plans).\nSalaried employees hired after December 31, 2005 are not eligible to participate in our qualified defined benefit pension plans, but are eligible to participate in a\nqualified defined contribution plan in addition to our other retirement savings plans. They also have the ability to participate in our retiree medical plans, but we do not\nsubsidize the cost of their participation in those plans as we do with employees hired before January 1, 2006. Over the last few years, we have negotiated similar changes\nwith various labor organizations such that new union represented employees do not participate in our defined benefit pension plans. Our qualified defined benefit pension\nplans for salaried employees were fully frozen effective January 1, 2020, at which time such employees no longer earn additional benefits under the defined benefit pension\nplans and were transitioned to an enhanced defined contribution retirement savings plan.\nOn August 3, 2021, we purchase",

The group annuity contracts were purchased\nusing assets from Lockheed Martin’s master retirement trust and no additional funding contribution was required by us. As a result of this transaction, we were relieved of\nall responsibility for these pension obligations and the insurance company is now required to pay and administer the retirement benefits beginning on January 1, 2022. This\ntransaction had no impact on the amount, timing, or form of the monthly retirement benefit payments to the affected retirees and beneficiaries. In connection with this\ntransaction, we recognized a noncash pension settlement charge of $1.7 billion ($1.3 billion, or $4.72 per share, after tax) for the affected plans in 2021, which represents\nthe accelerated recognition of actuarial losses that were included in the AOCL account within stockholders’ equity.\nOn December 3, 2020, we purchased a group annuity contract to transfer $1.4 billion of gross defined benefit pension obligations and related plan assets to an\ninsurance company for approximately 13,500 U.S. retirees and beneficiaries. As a result of this transaction, we were relieved of all responsibility for these pension\nobligations and the insurance company is now required to pay and administer the retirement benefits. Although this transaction was treated as a settlement for accounting\npurposes, we were not required to recognize a settlement charge because the aggregate value of settlements for the affected plans in 2020 were less than each plan’s service\nand interest cost.\nAlso on December 3, 2020, we purchased a group annuity contract pursuant to which an insurance company will reimburse the affected qualified defined benefit\npension plan for $793 million of gross defined benefit pension obligations for approximately 2,500 U.S. retirees and beneficiaries. Under the terms of the arrangement, the\nplan retains the obligation for paying the pension benefits to the covered retirees and beneficiaries and the insurance company will reimburse the plan as those benefits are\npaid. The group annuity contract provides us the option to transfer the defined benefit pension obligations to the insurance company at our discretion.

The NAV valuations are based on the underlying investments and typically redeemable within 90 days. The NAV is the total value of the fund divided by the\nnumber of the fund’s shares outstanding.\nPrivate equity funds consist of partnership and co-investment funds. The NAV is based on valuation models of the underlying securities, which includes unobservable\ninputs that cannot be corroborated using verifiable observable market data. These funds typically have redemption periods between eight and 12 years.\nReal estate funds consist of partnerships, most of which are closed-end funds, for which the NAV is based on valuation models and periodic appraisals. These funds\ntypically have redemption periods between eight and 10 years.\nHedge funds consist of direct hedge funds for which the NAV is generally based on the valuation of the underlying investments.

Accordingly, unless otherwise indicated below in our discussion of legal proceedings, a reasonably possible loss or range of loss associated with\nany individual legal proceeding cannot be estimated.\nLegal Proceedings\nUnited States of America, ex rel. Patzer; Cimma v. Sikorsky Aircraft Corp., et al\nAs a result of our acquisition of Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation (Sikorsky), we assumed the defense of and any potential liability for two civil False Claims Act\nlawsuits pending in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. In October 2014, the U.S. Government filed a complaint in intervention in the first suit,\nwhich was brought by qui tam relator Mary Patzer, a former Derco Aerospace (Derco) employee. In May 2017, the U.S. Government filed a complaint in intervention in a\nsecond suit, which was brought by qui tam relator Peter Cimma, a former Sikorsky Support Services, Inc. (SSSI) employee. In November 2017, the Court consolidated the\ncases into a single action for discovery and trial.\nThe U.S. Government alleges that Sikorsky and two of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Derco and SSSI, violated the civil False Claims Act and the Truth in\nNegotiations Act in connection with a contract the U.S. Navy awarded to SSSI in June 2006 to support the Navy’s T-34 and T-44 fixed-wing turboprop training aircraft.\nSSSI subcontracted with Derco, primarily to procure and manage spare parts for the training aircraft. The U.S. Government contends that SSSI overbilled the Navy on the\ncontract as the result of Derco’s use of prohibited cost-plus-percentage-of-cost (CPPC) pricing to add profit and overhead costs as a percentage of the price of the spare\nparts that Derco procured and then sold to SSSI. The U.S. Government also alleges that Derco’s claims to SSSI, SSSI’s claims to the Navy, and SSSI’s yearly Certificates of\nFinal Indirect Costs from 2006 through 2012 were false and that SSSI submitted inaccurate cost or pricing data in violation of the Truth in Negotiations Act for a sole-\nsourced, follow-on “bridge” contract. The U.S. Government’s complaints assert common law claims for breach of contract and unjust enrichment. On November 29, 2021,\nthe District Court granted the U.S. Government’s motion for partial summary judgment, finding that the Derco-SSSI agreement was a CPPC contract.\nWe believe that we have legal and factual defenses to the U.S. Government’s remaining claims.

Metropolitan Transportation Authority\nOn April 24, 2009, we filed a declaratory judgment action against the New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority and its Capital Construction Company\n(collectively, the MTA) asking the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York to find that the MTA is in material breach of our agreement based on the\nMTA’s failure to provide access to sites where work must be performed and the customer-furnished equipment necessary to complete the contract. The MTA filed an\nanswer and counterclaim alleging that we breached the contract and subsequently terminated the contract for alleged default. The primary damages sought by the MTA are\nthe costs to complete the contract and potential re-procurement costs. While we are unable to estimate the cost of another contractor to complete the contract and the costs\nof re-procurement, we note that our contract with the MTA had a total value of $323 million, of which $241 million was paid to us, and that the MTA is seeking damages of\napproximately $190 million. We dispute the MTA’s allegations and are defending against them. Additionally, following an investigation, our sureties on a performance\nbond related to this matter, who were represented by independent counsel, concluded that the MTA’s termination of the contract was improper. Finally, our declaratory\njudgment action was later amended to include claims for monetary damages against the MTA of approximately $95 million. This matter was taken under submission by the\nDistrict Court in December 2014, after a five-week bench trial and the filing of post-trial pleadings by the parties. We continue to await a decision from the District Court.\nAlthough this matter relates to our former Information Systems & Global Solutions (IS&GS) business, we retained responsibility for the litigation when we divested\nIS&GS in 2016.\nEnvironmental Matters\nWe are involved in proceedings and potential proceedings relating to soil, sediment, surface water, and groundwater contamination, disposal of hazardous substances,\nand other environmental matters at several of our current or former facilities, facilities for which we may have contractual responsibility, and at third-party sites where we\nhave been designated as a potentially responsible party (PRP). \nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, the aggregate amount of liabilities recorded relative to environmental matters was $742 m",

We are monitoring\nor investigating a number of former and present operating facilities for potential future remediation. We perform quarterly reviews of the status of our environmental\nremediation sites and the related liabilities and receivables. Additionally, in our quarterly reviews, we consider these and other factors in estimating the timing and amount\nof any future costs that may be required for remediation activities, and we record a liability when it is probable that a loss has occurred or will occur for a particular site and\nthe loss can be reasonably estimated. The amount of liability recorded is based on our estimate of the costs to be incurred for remediation for that site. We do not discount\nthe recorded liabilities, as the amount and timing of future cash payments are not fixed or cannot be reliably determined. We cannot reasonably determine the extent of our\nfinancial exposure in all cases as, although a loss may be probable or reasonably possible, in some cases it is not possible at this time to estimate the reasonably possible\nloss or range of loss. We project costs and recovery of costs over approximately 20 years.\nWe also pursue claims for recovery of costs incurred or for contribution to site remediation costs against other PRPs, including the U.S. Government, and are\nconducting remediation activities under various consent decrees, orders, and agreements relating to soil, groundwater, sediment, or surface water contamination at certain\nsites of former or current operations. Under agreements related to certain sites in California, New York, United States Virgin Islands and Washington, the U.S. Government\nand/or a private party reimburses us an amount equal to a percentage, specific to each site, of expenditures for certain remediation activities in their capacity as PRPs under\nthe Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA).\nIn addition to the proceedings and potential proceedings discussed above, the California State Water Resources Control Board, a branch of the California\nEnvironmental Protection Agency, has indicated it will work to re-establish a maximum level of the contaminant hexavalent chromium in drinki",

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency decided in June 2020 not\nto regulate perchlorate in drinking water at the federal level, although this decision has been challenged, and is considering whether to regulate hexavalent chromium.\nIf substantially lower standards are adopted for perchlorate (in California) or for hexavalent chromium (in California or at the federal level), we expect a material\nincrease in our estimates for environmental liabilities and the related assets for the portion of the increased costs that are probable of future recovery in the pricing of our\nproducts and services for the U.S. Government.

PFAS have been used ubiquitously, such as in fire-fighting foams, manufacturing processes, and stain- and stick-resistant products (e.g.,\nTeflon, stain-resistant fabrics). Because we have used products and processes over the years containing some of those compounds, they likely exist as contaminants at many\nof our environmental remediation sites.

The weighted average price does not take into account shares\nissued pursuant to RSUs or PSUs.\nThe shares represent annual incentive bonuses and Long-Term Incentive Performance (LTIP) payments earned and voluntarily deferred by employees. The deferred amounts are payable\nunder the Deferred Management Incentive Compensation Plan (DMICP). Deferred amounts are credited as phantom stock units at the closing price of our stock on the date the deferral is\neffective. Amounts equal to our dividend are credited as stock units at the time we pay a dividend. Following termination of employment, a number of shares of stock equal to the number\nof stock units credited to the employee’s DMICP account are distributed to the employee. There is no discount or value transfer on the stock distributed. Distributions may be made from\nnewly issued shares or shares purchased on the open market. Historically, all distributions have come from shares held in a separate trust and, therefore, do not further dilute our common\nshares outstanding. As a result, these shares also were not considered in calculating the total weighted average exercise price in the table. Because the DMICP shares are outstanding,\nthey should be included in the denominator (and not the numerator) of a dilution calculation.\nITEM 13.

We encourage you to read our Charter and Bylaws, and the applicable provisions of the MGCL, for additional\ninformation.\nAuthorized Capital Stock\nThe authorized shares of stock of the Corporation consist of 1,550,000,000 shares, divided into 50,000,000 shares of Series Preferred Stock, $1.00 par value per share\n(“Preferred Stock”), and 1,500,000,000 shares of Common Stock, $1.00 par value per share (“Common Stock”). There are no shares of Preferred Stock outstanding.\nCommon Stock\nFully Paid and Non-Assessable\nAll outstanding shares of Common Stock are fully paid and non-assessable.\nVoting Rights\nSubject to the rights of holders of outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, if any, each share of Common Stock entitles the holder to one vote per share on all matters upon\nwhich stockholders are entitled to vote. The Corporation’s Board of Directors (“Board of Directors”) is not classified and each director is elected annually. The Bylaws\nestablish a majority voting standard for director elections, which requires a director to receive more votes cast for election than votes cast against election for that director\nto be elected. If, however, a stockholder has duly nominated an individual for election to the Board of Directors and the nomination has not been withdrawn on or prior to\nthe 14  day prior to the date on which the Corporation first mails notice of a stockholders’ meeting, then a plurality of all votes cast is sufficient to elect a nominee to the\nBoard of Directors. The Charter does not provide for cumulative voting for the election of directors, except as described below under “Certain Provisions of the Charter,\nBylaws and the MGCL—Cumulative Voting for Directors.”\nDividend Rights\nSubject to the rights of holders of outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, if any, the holders of Common Stock are entitled to dividends and other distributions, if any,\nauthorized by the Board of Directors in accordance with the MGCL.\nLiquidation Rights\nSubject to the rights of holders of outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, if any, holders of Common Stock share ratably in all assets legally available for distribution to\nstockholders in the event of dissolution of the Corporation.\nOther Rights and Preferences\nOur Common Stock has no preferences, preemptive, conversion or exchange rights, and is not subject to any redemption or sinking fund provisions or to calls or\nassessments by, or liabilities of, the Corporation. Holders of Common Stock may act by written consent only if the consent is unanimous.\nCertain Provisions of the Charter, Bylaws and the MGCL\nCertain provisions of the Charter, Bylaws and the MGCL could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of the Co",

These business combinations include a merger, consolidation, share exchange or, in certain circumstances\nspecified in the MBCA, a sale, lease, transfer or other disposition of assets, or issuance or transfer or reclassification of equity securities, liquidation or dissolution plans,\nand receipt of certain benefits by the interested stockholder or its affiliates. The MBCA defines an “interested stockholder” as (i) any person who beneficially owns, directly\nor indirectly, 10 percent or more of the voting power of the corporation’s shares or (ii) an affiliate or associate of the corporation who, at any time within the two-year\nperiod immediately prior to the date in question, was the beneficial owner of 10 percent or more of the voting power of the corporation’s then outstanding voting stock.\nA person is not an “interested stockholder” under the MBCA if a corporation’s board of directors approved in advance the transaction by which such person otherwise\nwould have become an interested stockholder.\nAfter the five-year moratorium described above, a business combination between a corporation and an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder\nmust be recommended by the corporation’s board of directors and approved by the affirmative vote of at least (i) 80 percent of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of\noutstanding shares of the corporation’s voting stock and (ii) two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of the corporation’s voting stock other than shares held by\nthe interested stockholder with whom or with whose affiliate the business combination is to be effected or by an affiliate or associate of the interested stockholder.

Question to answer:\nWhat is Lockheed Martin's FY2021 net working capital? Define net working capital as total current assets less total current liabilities. Answer in USD millions. Respond to the question by assuming the perspective of an investment analyst who can only use the details shown within the balance sheet.\n\n2. Collected Job Outputs (from junior models):\nExtracted Information:\nTotal Current Assets for FY2021:\nThe total current assets for FY2021 are $19,815 million.\nThe total current liabilities for FY2021 are $13,997 million.\n\nMy reasoning for answering this task is based on the provided document excerpt, where I identified the relevant information under the \"Balance sheet\" section.\n\nThe direct citation from the text that supports my explanation is:\n\n\"Balance sheet\n...\nTotal current assets\n19,815\n19,378\n17,095\n16,103\n17,505\n...\nTotal current assets for FY2021: $645 million\n\nTotal current liabilities for FY2021: $742 million\nThe total current assets for FY2021 are $19,815 million, and the total current liabilities for FY2021 are $13,997 million.\nUnfortunately, the provided document excerpt does not contain the total current assets and total current liabilities for FY2021. However, we can find the total assets and total liabilities for FY2021.\n\nTotal assets for FY2021: $50,873 million\n\nTotal liabilities for FY2021: $50,873 - $10,959 = $39,914 million\nTotal current assets for FY2021: \n- Contract assets: $43.9 billion (Contract assets are net of progress payments and performance based payments from our customers as well as advance payments from non-U.S. Government customers totaling approximately $43.9 billion as of December 31, 2021)\n- Inventories: $2.981 billion (Inventories consisted of the following (in millions): 2021 $2,981)\n\nTotal current liabilities for FY2021:\nThe total current assets for FY2021 are not explicitly mentioned in the given excerpt. However, the total current assets for FY2021 can be inferred as $40,566 million.\n\nThe total current liabilities for FY2021 are not explicitly mentioned in the given excerpt.\n\nThe citation that supports the inference of total current assets for FY2021 is: \n$\n40,566\nTotal Current Liabilities for FY2021:\nThe total current liabilities for FY2021 is $26,831 million.\n\nThe relevant section from the text that supports this answer is:\n\n\"Payments due under these obligations and commitments are as follows\n(in millions):\nTotal\nDue Within\n 1 Year\nTotal debt\n$\n12,799 \n$\n6 \nInterest payments\n8,827 \n537 \nOther liabilities\n2,503 \n242 \nOperating lease obligations\n1,566 \n325 \nPurchase obligations:\nOperating activities\n56,923\n\n\n## Instructions\nThink step-by-step about:\n1.

If sufficient, how we would calculate or derive the answer\n5. If there are conflicting answers:\n--> Use citations to select the correct answer if there are conflicting answers.\n\nBe brief and concise.

      "output": "Based on the collected outputs from the junior models, we have gathered the following information:\n\n1. **Total Current Assets for FY2021**: There are multiple figures mentioned:\n   - $19,815 million\n   - $645 million\n   - $40,566 million (inferred)\n\n2. **Total Current Liabilities for FY2021**: There are also multiple figures mentioned:\n   - $13,997 million\n   - $742 million\n   - $26,831 million\n\nTo determine if we can answer the question, we need to assess the consistency and reliability of these figures:\n\n- The most frequently mentioned figure for total current assets is $19,815 million, which appears twice and is supported by a direct citation from the balance sheet section.\n- The most frequently mentioned figure for total current liabilities is $13,997 million, which also appears twice and is supported by a direct citation.\n\nGiven these observations, we can conclude that the figures $19,815 million for total current assets and $13,997 million for total current liabilities are the most reliable based on the citations provided.\n\nTo calculate the net working capital, we subtract total current liabilities from total current assets:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Net Working Capital} = \\text{Total Current Assets} - \\text{Total Current Liabilities} = 19,815 - 13,997 = 5,818 \\text{ million USD}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the net working capital for Lockheed Martin's FY2021 is $5,818 million.
