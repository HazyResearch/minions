--- Question ---
Are Best Buy's gross margins historically consistent (not fluctuating more than roughly 2% each year)? If gross margins are not a relevant metric for a company like this, then please state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
Best Buy's overall and domestic gross margins are historically consistent, not fluctuating more than roughly 2% each year. However, the international segment's gross margins are not consistent, as they fluctuate more than 2% annually.

--- Ground Truth ---
['Yes, the margins have been consistent, there has been a minor decline of 1.1% in gross margins between FY2022 and FY2023.']

--- Correctness Evaluation ---
Is correct: False
Confidence: 0.80
Reasoning: The predicted answer does not match the ground truth answer in terms of the overall conclusion. The ground truth states that Best Buy's gross margins are consistent, while the predicted answer introduces a distinction between domestic and international segments, stating that the international segment's margins are not consistent. This additional context changes the overall conclusion, which does not align with the ground truth.
