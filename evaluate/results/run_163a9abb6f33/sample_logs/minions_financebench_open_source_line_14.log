--- Question ---
Does Adobe have an improving operating margin profile as of FY2022? If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then state that and explain why.

Based on the available information, Adobe does not appear to have an improving operating margin profile as of FY2022. The inferred data suggests a potential decrease in operating margin from FY2021 to FY2022, but explicit figures and comprehensive analysis are lacking to make a definitive conclusion.
