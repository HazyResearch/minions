  "predicted_answer": "AMEX does not have an improving operating margin profile as of 2022, primarily because the operating margin is not explicitly reported or emphasized in the available data. Instead, AMEX's financial performance is better assessed using metrics like return on equity and net interest margin, which are more relevant to its business model focused on interest income and credit risk management.",
