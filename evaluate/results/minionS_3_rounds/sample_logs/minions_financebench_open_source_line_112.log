--- Question ---
Has Microsoft increased its debt on balance sheet between FY2023 and the FY2022 period?

--- Predicted Answer ---
Based on the conflicting and fragmented data, it is not possible to definitively determine whether Microsoft increased its debt on the balance sheet between FY2023 and FY2022.

--- Ground Truth ---
['No. Microsoft decreased its debt by $2.5bn in FY 2023 vs FY 2022.']

--- Correctness Evaluation ---
Is correct: False
Confidence: 0.90
Reasoning: The predicted answer does not match the ground truth answer. The ground truth states that Microsoft decreased its debt, which is a definitive 'No' to the question of whether Microsoft increased its debt. The predicted answer is inconclusive and does not provide a definitive stance, which is required for yes/no questions.
