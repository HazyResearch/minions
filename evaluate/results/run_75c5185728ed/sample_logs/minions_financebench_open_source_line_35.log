--- Question ---
What drove operating margin change as of the FY22 for AMD? If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then please state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
AMD's operating margin in FY22 was primarily affected by increased operating expenses, driven by amortization of acquisition-related intangibles from the Xilinx acquisition, higher research and development expenses, and stock-based compensation. The company's strategic focus on expanding its product portfolio and market presence through acquisitions also played a significant role. Market conditions, including competition and demand fluctuations, further influenced the operating margin.

--- Ground Truth ---
["The decrease in AMD's operating income was primarily driven by amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition"]
