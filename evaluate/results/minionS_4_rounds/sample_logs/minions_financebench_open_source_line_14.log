--- Question ---
Does Adobe have an improving operating margin profile as of FY2022? If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
Adobe has an improving operating margin profile as of FY2022.

--- Ground Truth ---
['No the operating margins of Adobe have recently declined from 36.8% in FY 2021 to 34.6% in FY2022. A drop by 2.2% in a year.']

--- Correctness Evaluation ---
Is correct: False
Confidence: 1.00
Reasoning: The predicted answer states that Adobe has an improving operating margin profile as of FY2022, which contradicts the ground truth answer. The ground truth indicates a decline in operating margins from 36.8% in FY2021 to 34.6% in FY2022. Since this is a yes/no question, the stance must match exactly, and it does not in this case.
