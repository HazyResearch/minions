--- Question ---
What is the FY2017 - FY2019 3 year average of capex as a % of revenue for Activision Blizzard? Answer in units of percents and round to one decimal place. Calculate (or extract) the answer from the statement of income and the cash flow statement.

--- Predicted Answer ---
FY2017: 2.2%, FY2018: 1.7%, FY2019: 1.8%, 3-year average: 1.9%

--- Ground Truth ---
['1.9%']

--- Correctness Evaluation ---
Is correct: True
Confidence: 1.00
Reasoning: The predicted answer provides the capex as a percentage of revenue for each fiscal year (FY2017: 2.2%, FY2018: 1.7%, FY2019: 1.8%) and correctly calculates the 3-year average as 1.9%. This matches the ground truth answer. The additional context of individual yearly percentages does not contradict the ground truth and is within the evaluation rules.
