--- Question ---
Are Best Buy's gross margins historically consistent (not fluctuating more than roughly 2% each year)? If gross margins are not a relevant metric for a company like this, then please state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
Best Buy's overall and domestic gross margins are historically consistent, not fluctuating more than roughly 2% each year. However, the international segment's gross margins are not consistent, as they fluctuate more than 2% annually.

--- Ground Truth ---
['Yes, the margins have been consistent, there has been a minor decline of 1.1% in gross margins between FY2022 and FY2023.']

--- Correctness Evaluation ---
Is correct: False
Confidence: 0.80
Reasoning: The predicted answer does not match the ground truth stance on the consistency of Best Buy's gross margins. The ground truth states that the margins are consistent, while the predicted answer introduces a distinction between domestic and international segments, claiming inconsistency in the international segment. This additional context contradicts the ground truth's overall assessment of consistency.
