FCF here is defined as: (cash from operations - capex). Answer in USD millions.\n\n---\n\nPlease provide succinct advice on the critical information we need to extract from the Financial document. Total length: 436974 characters to answer this question. \n\nAlso consider the following constraints:\n- In your response do NOT use numbered lists.\n- Do NOT structure your response as a sequence of steps.\n",
      "output": "To determine the FY2020 free cash flow (FCF) for General Mills, focus on extracting specific figures from the statement of cash flows within the financial document. The critical information needed includes the total cash from operations and the capital expenditures (capex) for the fiscal year 2020. Cash from operations is typically listed under operating activities, while capex is found under investing activities. Subtract the capex from the cash from operations to calculate the FCF. Ensure that the figures are in USD millions to match the required format for the answer."

Instead, you can assign small, isolated tasks to a less capable worker model that sees only a single chunk of text at a time. Any cross-chunk or multi-document reasoning must be handled by you.\n\n## Your Job: Write Two Python Functions\n\n### FUNCTION #1: `prepare_jobs(context, prev_job_manifests, prev_job_outputs) -> List[JobManifest]`\n- Break the document(s) into chunks (using the provided chunking function, if needed). Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 12 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`. All **multi-chunk integration** or **global reasoning** is your responsibility here.\n- Return one **aggregated string** suitable for further supervisor inspection.\n\n\n\n## Relevant Pydantic Models\n\nThe following models are already in the global scope. **Do NOT redefine or re-import them.**\n\n### JobManifest Model\n```\nclass JobManifest(BaseModel):\n    chunk: str  # the actual text for the chunk of the document\n    task: str  # the actual task instruction for the small model\n    advice: str  # optional, any additional advice on how to perform the task\n\n    chunk_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    task_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    job_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n\n```\n\n### JobOutput Model\n```\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    citation: Optional[str]\n    answer: Optional[str]\n\n```\n\n## Function Signatures\n```\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        context (List[str]): A list of documents.

Fiscal 2019 included 12 months of results, \nand fiscal 2018 did not include results for the Pet operating segment. \n \nWe manage and review the financial results of our business under five operating segments: North America Retail; Convenience Stores \n& Foodservice; Europe & Australia; Asia & Latin America; and Pet. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition \nand Results of Operations (MD&A) in Item 7 of this report for a description of our segments. \n \nWe offer a variety of food products that provide great taste, nutrition, convenience, and value for consumers around the world.

The categories in which we participate also are very competitive. Our principal competitors in these categories \nare manufacturers, as well as retailers with their own branded products. Competitors market and sell their products through brick-and-\nmortar stores and e-commerce. All of our principal competitors have substantial financial, marketing, and other resources. Competition \nin our product categories is based on product innovation, product quality, price, brand recognition and loyalty, effectiveness of \n\n\n \n5 \n \nmarketing, promotional activity, convenient ordering and delivery to the consumer, and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer \npreferences. Our principal strategies for competing in each of our segments include unique consumer insights, effective customer \nrelationships, superior product quality, innovative advertising, product promotion, product innovation aligned with consumers’ needs, \nan efficient supply chain, and price. In most product categories, we compete not only with other widely advertised, branded products, \nbut also with regional brands and with generic and private label products that are generally sold at lower prices. Internationally, we \ncompete with both multi-national and local manufacturers, and each country includes a unique group of competitors. \n \nRaw materials, ingredients, and packaging \nThe principal raw materials that we use are grains (wheat, oats, and corn), dairy products, sugar, fruits, vegetable oils, meats, nuts, \nvegetables, and other agricultural products. We also use substantial quantities of carton board, corrugated, plastic and metal packaging \nmaterials, operating supplies, and energy. Most of these inputs for our domestic and Canadian operations are purchased from suppliers \nin the United States. In our other international operations, inputs that are not locally available in adequate supply may be imported from \nother countries. The cost of these inputs may fluctuate widely due to external conditions such as weather, climate change, product \nscarcity, limited sources of supply, commodity market fluctuations, currency fluctuations, trade tariffs, pandemics (including the \nCOVID-19 pandemic), and changes in governmental agricultural and energy policies and regulations. We have some long-term fixed \nprice contracts, but the majority of our inputs are purchased on the open market. We believe that we will be able to obtain an adequate \nsupply of needed inputs. Occasionally and where possible, we make advance purchases of items significant to our business in order to \nensure continuity of operations",

Since these inputs generally represent the largest variable cost in manufacturing our \nproducts, to the extent possible, we often manage the risk associated with adverse price movements for some inputs using a variety of \nrisk management strategies. We also have a grain merchandising operation that provides us efficient access to, and more informed \nknowledge of, various commodity markets, principally wheat and oats. This operation holds physical inventories that are carried at net \nrealizable value and uses derivatives to manage its net inventory position and minimize its market exposures. \n \nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT \n \nOur research and development resources are focused on new product development, product improvement, process design and \nimprovement, packaging, and exploratory research in new business and technology areas.

After the onset of the pandemic, elevated at-home food demand accelerated net sales growth in the fourth quarter in the \nNorth America Retail segment, where a significant share of net sales comes from categories that were most impacted by at-home eating, \nincluding meals, baking, and cereal. The impact of elevated at-home demand was less pronounced in the Europe & Australia segment, \nreflecting its lower proportion of net sales in those categories. The Pet segment experienced increased demand early in the fourth quarter \nfrom stock-up purchasing, which partially unwound by the end of the quarter. Lower away-from-home food demand reduced growth \nfor the Convenience Stores & Foodservice and Asia & Latin America segments. Consequently, our full-year results significantly \nexceeded our initial annual targets for organic net sales growth, constant-currency growth in adjusted operating profit and adjusted \ndiluted earnings per share (EPS), and free cash flow conversion. \nWe delivered on the three key priorities we outlined at the beginning of fiscal 2020: \nFirst, we accelerated our organic net sales growth rate compared to our fiscal 2019 performance, driven by strong execution to \nmeet elevated demand during the COVID-19 pandemic, healthy levels of innovation, and a significant increase in capabilities \nand brand-building investment.  We experienced robust growth in organic net sales in North America Retail, aided by our \nability to meet the pandemic-related increase in demand for meals and baking categories during the fourth quarter, as well as \nconsistently strong results in U.S. cereal and important improvements in U.S. snack bars and U.S. yogurt throughout the year.  \nWe exceeded our organic net sales growth goal for our Pet segment, driven by a successful expansion of BLUE into additional \ncustomer outlets and a significant increase in household penetration for the brand.  Organic net sales results in our Convenience \nStores & Foodservice, Europe & Australia, and Asia & Latin America segments were below fiscal 2019 levels, due to a slow \nstart to the year in each of those segments, as well as the pandemic-related headwinds impacting Convenience Stores & \nFoodservice and Asia & Latin America in the second half of the year. \nSecond, we maintained our strong adjusted operating profit margins.  The combination of our continued strong levels of Holistic \nMargin Management (HMM) savings, volume growth, and positive net price realization and mix offset input cost inflation and \nincreased investments in brand building and capabilities, resulting in significant growth in constant-currency adjusted operating \nprofit and adjusted diluted EPS.   \nThird, we reduced our leverage.

We expect to make further progress in fiscal 2021 in reducing our net debt-\nto-adjusted EBITDA ratio. \n \nWe expect the largest factor impacting our fiscal 2021 performance will be relative balance of at-home versus away-from-home \nconsumer food demand. This balance will be determined by factors such as consumers’ ability and willingness to eat in restaurants, the \nproportion of people working from home, the reopening of schools, and changes in consumers’ income levels. While the COVID-19 \npandemic has significantly influenced each of these factors in recent months, the magnitude and duration of its future impact remains \nhighly uncertain. \n \nWe expect consumer concerns about COVID-19 virus transmission and the recession to drive elevated demand for food at home, relative \nto pre-pandemic levels. We are tracking the level of virus control, the possibility of a second-wave outbreak, the availability of a vaccine, \nGDP growth, unemployment rates, consumer confidence, and wage growth, among other factors, to assess the likely magnitude and \nduration of elevated at-home food demand.  \n \nCertain terms used throughout this report are defined in a glossary in Item 8 of this report. \n \nFISCAL 2020 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n \nFiscal 2020 had 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks in fiscal 2019.

Changes \nin these factors could cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows. In the normal course of business, we actively manage our \nexposure to these market risks by entering into various hedging transactions, authorized under established policies that place clear \ncontrols on these activities. The counterparties in these transactions are generally highly rated institutions. We establish credit limits for \neach counterparty. Our hedging transactions include but are not limited to a variety of derivative financial instruments. For information \non interest rate, foreign exchange, commodity price, and equity instrument risk, please see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial \nStatements in Item 8 of this report. \n \nVALUE AT RISK \n \nThe estimates in the table below are intended to measure the maximum potential fair value we could lose in one day from adverse \nchanges in market interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, and equity prices under normal market conditions. A Monte \nCarlo value-at-risk (VAR) methodology was used to quantify the market risk for our exposures. The models assumed normal market \nconditions and used a 95 percent confidence level. \n \nThe VAR calculation used historical interest and foreign exchange rates, and commodity and equity prices from the past year to estimate \nthe potential volatility and correlation of these rates in the future. The market data were drawn from the RiskMetrics™ data set. The \ncalculations are not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that we expect to incur. Further, since the hedging instrument (the \nderivative) inversely correlates with the underlying exposure, we would expect that any loss or gain in the fair value of our derivatives \nwould be generally offset by an increase or decrease in the fair value of the underlying exposure. The positions included in the \ncalculations were: debt; investments; interest rate swaps; foreign exchange forwards; commodity swaps, futures, and options; and equity \ninstruments. The calculations do not include the underlying foreign exchange and commodities or equity-related positions that are offset \nby these market-risk-sensitive instruments.  \n \n \n \n\n\n \n44 \n \nThe table below presents the estimated maximum potential VAR ",

A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the \nmaintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the \ncompany; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in \naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in \naccordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention \n\n\n \n47 \n \nor timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the \nfinancial statements. \n \nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.

The impairment tests for these assets, \nwhich are performed annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred, \nrequire the Company to estimate the fair value of the reporting units to which goodwill is assigned as well as the brand and \nother indefinite-lived intangible assets. The fair value estimates are derived from discounted cash flow analyses that require \nthe Company to make judgments about highly subjective matters, including future operating results, including revenue growth \nrates and operating margins, and an estimate of the discount rates and royalty rates.  \n \nWe identified the evaluation of valuation of goodwill and brands and other indefinite-lived intangible assets as a critical audit \nmatter. There was a significant degree of judgment required in evaluating audit evidence, which consists primarily of forward \nlooking assumptions about future operating results, specifically the revenue growth rates, operating margins, royalty rates and \nsubjective inputs used to estimate the discount rates. \n \nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We evaluated the design and \ntested the operating effectiveness of internal controls related to the critical audit matter. This included controls related to the \nassumptions about future operating results and the discount and royalty rates used to measure the reporting unit and brand and \nother intangible fair values. We performed sensitivity analyses over the revenue growth rates, operating margins, brand royalty \nrates and discount rates to assess the impact of other points within a range of potential assumptions. We evaluated the revenue \ngrowth rates and operating margin assumptions by comparing them to recent financial performance and external market and \nindustry data. We evaluated whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. \nProfessionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the Company’s discount rates and \nroyalty rates by comparing them against rate ranges that were independently developed using publicly available market data \nfor comparable entities. \n \n \n/s/ KPMG LLP \n \nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1928. \n \nMinneapolis",

AND SUBSIDIARIES \n \nNOTE 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND RECLASSIFICATIONS \n \nBasis of Presentation \nOur Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of General Mills, Inc. and all subsidiaries in which we have a controlling \nfinancial interest. Intercompany transactions and accounts, including any noncontrolling and redeemable interests’ share of those \ntransactions, are eliminated in consolidation. \n \nOur fiscal year ends on the last Sunday in May. Fiscal year 2020 consisted of 53 weeks, while fiscal years 2019 and 2018 consisted of \n52 weeks. \n \nCertain reclassifications to our previously reported financial information have been made to conform to the current period presentation. \nSee Note 2 for additional information.  \n \nChange in Reporting Period  \nAs part of a long-term plan to conform the fiscal year ends of all our operations, in fiscal 2020 we changed the reporting period of our \nPet segment from an April fiscal year-end to a May fiscal year-end to match our fiscal calendar. Accordingly, our fiscal 2020 results \ninclude 13 months of Pet segment results compared to 12 months in fiscal 2019. The impact of this change was not material to our \nconsolidated results of operations and, therefore, we did not restate prior period financial statements for comparability. Our India \nbusiness is on an April fiscal year end.  \n \nNOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES \n \nCash and Cash Equivalents  \nWe consider all investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. \n \nInventories  \nAll inventories in the United States other than grain are valued at the lower of cost, using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method, or market. \nGrain inventories are valued at net realizable value, and all related cash contracts and derivatives are valued at fair value, with all net \nchanges in value recorded in earnings currently. \n \nInventories outside of the United States are generally valued at the lower of cost, using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, or net \nrealizable value. \n \nShipping costs associated with the distribution of finished product to our customers are recorded as cost of sales, and are recognized \nwhen the related finished product is shipped to and accepted by the customer. \n \nLand, Buildings, Equipment, and Depreciation  \nLand is recorded at historical cost. Buildings and equipment, including capitalized interest and internal engineering costs, are recorded \nat cost and depreciated over estimated useful lives, primarily using the straight-line method. Ordinary maintenance and repairs are \ncharged to cost of sales. Buildings are usually depreciated over 40 years, and equipment, furniture, and software are usually depreciated \nover 3 to 10 years.

When an item is sold or retired, the \naccounts are relieved of its cost and related accumulated depreciation and the resulting gains and losses, if any, are recognized in \nearnings. As of May 31, 2020, assets held for sale were insignificant. \n \nLong-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an \nasset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows \nfrom the operation and disposition of the asset group are less than the carrying amount of the asset group. Asset groups have identifiable \ncash flows and are largely independent of other asset groups. Measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the \ncarrying amount of the asset group over its fair value. Fair value is measured using a discounted cash flow model or independent \nappraisals, as appropriate. \n \nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets  \nGoodwill is not subject to amortization and is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate \nthat impairment may have occurred. We perform our annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment test as of the \nfirst day of the second quarter of the fiscal year. Impairment testing is performed for each of our reporting units. We compare the carrying \nvalue of a reporting unit, including goodwill, to the fair value of the unit. Carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated \n\n\n \n54 \n \nwith the operations of that reporting unit, which often requires allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units. If the \ncarrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, impairment has occurred. We recognize an impairment charge for the amount \nby which the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value up to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting \nunit. Our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model. Growth rates for sales and profits are determined \nusing inputs from our long-range planning process. We also make estimates of discount rates, perpetuity growth assumptions, market \ncomparables, and other factors.  \n \nWe evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets, mainly brands, to determine if they are finite or indefinite-lived. Reaching a \ndetermination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, \ncompetition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, known technological advances, legislative action that results \nin an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance \nexpenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets.

Our estimate of the fair value of the brands is based \non a discounted cash flow model using inputs which included projected revenues from our long-range plan, assumed royalty rates that \ncould be payable if we did not own the brands, and a discount rate.  \n \nOur finite-lived intangible assets, primarily acquired franchise agreements and customer relationships, are reviewed for impairment \nwhenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.

Fair value is measured using a \ndiscounted cash flow model or other similar valuation model, as appropriate.  \n \nLeases \nWe determine whether an arrangement is a lease at inception. When our lease arrangements include lease and non-lease components, \nwe account for lease and non-lease components (e.g. common area maintenance) separately based on their relative standalone prices.  \n \nAny lease arrangements with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, and we recognize \nlease costs for these lease arrangements on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Many of our lease arrangements provide us with \noptions to exercise one or more renewal terms or to terminate the lease arrangement. We include these options when we are reasonably \ncertain to exercise them in the lease term used to establish our right of use assets and lease liabilities. Generally, our lease agreements \ndo not include an option to purchase the leased asset, residual value guarantees, or material restrictive covenants. \n \nWe have certain lease arrangements with variable rental payments. Our lease arrangements for our Häagen-Dazs retail shops often \ninclude rental payments that are based on a percentage of retail sales. We have other lease arrangements that are adjusted periodically \nbased on an inflation index or rate.

We receive royalty income from certain joint ventures, incur various expenses (primarily research and \ndevelopment), and record the tax impact of certain joint venture operations that are structured as partnerships. In addition, we make \nadvances to our joint ventures in the form of loans or capital investments. We also sell certain raw materials, semi-finished goods, and \nfinished goods to the joint ventures, generally at market prices. \n \nIn addition, we assess our investments in our joint ventures if we have reason to believe an impairment may have occurred including, \nbut not limited to, as a result of ongoing operating losses, projected decreases in earnings, increases in the weighted-average cost of \ncapital, or significant business disruptions.  The significant assumptions used to estimate fair value include revenue growth and \nprofitability, royalty rates, capital spending, depreciation and taxes, foreign currency exchange rates, and a discount rate. By their nature, \nthese projections and assumptions are uncertain. If we were to determine the current fair value of our investment was less than the \ncarrying value of the investment, then we would assess if the shortfall was of a temporary or permanent nature and write down the \n\n\n \n55 \n \ninvestment to its fair value if we concluded the impairment is other than temporary. \n \nRedeemable Interest \nWe have a 51 percent controlling interest in Yoplait SAS, a consolidated entity. Sodiaal International (Sodiaal) holds the remaining 49 \npercent interest in Yoplait SAS. Sodiaal has the ability to put all or a portion of its redeemable interest to us at fair value once per year, \nup to three times before December 2024. This put option requires us to classify Sodiaal’s interest as a redeemable interest outside of \nequity on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for as long as the put is exercisable by Sodiaal. When the put is no longer exercisable, the \nredeemable interest will be reclassified to noncontrolling interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We adjust the value of the \nredeemable interest through additional paid-in capital on our Consolidated Balance Sheets quarterly to the redeemable interest’s \nredemption value, which approximates its fair value.

We recognize revenue for the sale of packaged foods at the point in time when our performance obligation \nhas been satisfied and control of the product has transferred to our customer, which generally occurs when the shipment is accepted by \nour customer. Sales include shipping and handling charges billed to the customer and are reported net of variable consideration and \nconsideration payable to our customers, including trade promotion, consumer coupon redemption and other reductions to the transaction \nprice, including estimated allowances for returns, unsalable product, and prompt pay discounts. Sales, use, value-added, and other excise \ntaxes are not included in revenue. Trade promotions are recorded using significant judgment of estimated participation and performance \nlevels for offered programs at the time of sale. Differences between estimated and actual reductions to the transaction price are \nrecognized as a change in estimate in a subsequent period. We generally do not allow a right of return. However, on a limited case-by-\ncase basis with prior approval, we may allow customers to return product. In limited circumstances, product returned in saleable \ncondition is resold to other customers or outlets. Receivables from customers generally do not bear interest. Payment terms and collection \npatterns vary around the world and by channel, and are short-term, and as such, we do not have any significant financing components. \nOur allowance for doubtful accounts represents our estimate of probable non-payments and credit losses in our existing receivables, as \ndetermined based on a review of past due balances and other specific account data. Account balances are written off against the allowance \nwhen we deem the amount is uncollectible. Please see Note 17 for a disaggregation of our revenue into categories that depict how the \nnature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. We do not have material contract \nassets or liabilities arising from our contracts with customers. \n \nEnvironmental Costs  \nEnvironmental costs relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues are \nexpensed. Liabilities for anticipated remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably \nestimable, generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies or our commitment to a plan of action. \n \nAdvertising Production Costs  \nWe expense the production costs of advertising the first time that the advertising takes place. \n \nResearch and Development  \nAll expenditures for research and development (R&D) are charged against earnings in the period incurred.

Assets and liabilities of these operations are translated \nat the period-end exchange rates. Income statement accounts are translated using the average exchange rates prevailing during the period. \nTranslation adjustments are reflected within accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCI) in stockholders’ equity. Gains and losses \nfrom foreign currency transactions are included in net earnings for the period, except for gains and losses on investments in subsidiaries \nfor which settlement is not planned for the foreseeable future and foreign exchange gains and losses on instruments designated as net \ninvestment hedges.

We consider a stock-based award to be vested when the employee’s or director’s retention of the award \nis no longer contingent on providing subsequent service. Accordingly, the related compensation cost is generally recognized immediately \nfor awards granted to retirement-eligible individuals or over",

The new standard requires the service cost component of net periodic benefit expense to be recorded in the \nsame line items as other employee compensation costs within our Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

Our primary objective when entering into these derivative contracts is to achieve certainty \nwith regard to the future price of commodities purchased for use in our supply chain. We manage our exposures through a combination \nof purchase orders, long-term contracts with suppliers, exchange-traded futures and options, and over-the-counter options and swaps. \nWe offset our exposures based on current and projected market conditions and generally seek to acquire the inputs at as close to our \nplanned cost as possible. \n \nWe use derivatives to manage our exposure to changes in commodity prices.

Primary exposures include U.S. Treasury rates, LIBOR, Euribor, and commercial paper rates in the United States and Europe. \nWe use interest rate swaps, forward-starting interest rate swaps, and treasury locks to hedge our exposure to interest rate changes, to \nreduce the volatility of our financing costs, and to achieve a desired proportion of fixed rate versus floating-rate debt, based on current \nand projected market conditions. Generally under these swaps, we agree with a counterparty to exchange the difference between fixed-\nrate and floating-rate interest amounts based on an agreed upon notional principal amount. \n \nFloating Interest Rate Exposures — Floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges, as are all hedges of \nforecasted issuances of debt.

We \nestimate our future stock price volatility using the historical volatility over the expected term of the option, excluding time periods of \nvolatility we believe a marketplace participant would exclude in estimating our stock price volatility. We also have considered, but did \nnot use, implied volatility in our estimate, because trading activity in options on our stock, especially those with tenors of greater than \n6 months, is insufficient to provide a reliable measure of expected volatility. \n \nOur expected term represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical data to estimate \noption exercises and employee terminations within the valuation model. Separate groups of employees have similar historical exercise \nbehavior and therefore were aggregated into a single pool for valuation purposes. The weighted-average expected term for all employee \ngroups is presented in the table above. The risk-free interest rate for periods during the expected term of the options is based on the U.S. \nTreasury zero-coupon yield curve in effect at the time of grant. \n \nAny corporate income tax benefit realized upon exercise or vesting of an award in excess of that previously recognized in earnings \n(referred to as a windfall tax benefit) is presented in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as an operating cash flow.

We recognized windfall tax benefits from stock-based payments in income tax expense in our \nConsolidated Statements of Earnings of $27.3 million in fiscal 2020, $24.5 million in fiscal 2019, and $25.5 million in fiscal 2018.  \n \nOptions may be priced at 100 percent or more of the fair market value on the date of grant, and generally vest four years after the date \nof grant.

The defined \nbenefit pension plan and other postretirement benefit plan portfolios are broadly diversified across asset classes. Within asset classes, \nthe portfolios are further diversified across investment styles and investment organizations. For the U.S. defined benefit pension plans, \nthe long-term investment policy allocation is: 17 percent to equities in the United States; 11 percent to international equities; 9 percent \nto private equities; 50 percent to fixed income; and 13 percent to real assets (real estate, energy, and infrastructure).  For other U.S. \npostretirement benefit plans, the long-term investment policy allocations are: 18 percent to equities in the United States; 10 percent to \ninternational equities; 4 percent to private equities; 65 percent to fixed income; and 3 percent to real assets (real estate, energy, and \ntimber).

During fiscal 2019, we completed our accounting for the tax effects of the TCJA and recorded a benefit of $7.2 million which \nincluded adjustments to the transition tax and the measurement of our net U.S. deferred tax liability.  While our accounting for the \nrecorded impact of the TCJA is deemed to be complete, these amounts were based on prevailing regulations and currently available \ninformation, and any additional guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) could impact the aforementioned amounts in \nfuture periods. \n \nThe legislation also included provisions that affected our fiscal 2019 and forward results, including but not limited to: a reduction in the \nU.S. corporate tax rate on domestic operations; the creation of a new minimum tax called the base erosion anti-abuse tax; a new provision \nthat taxes U.S. allocated expenses as well as currently taxes certain income from foreign operations (Global Intangible Low Tax Income \nor GILTI); a new limitation on deductible interest expense; the repeal of the domestic manufacturing deduction; and limitations on the \ndeductibility of certain executive compensation.   \n \nAs of May 31, 2020, we have not recognized a deferred tax liability for unremitted earnings of approximately $2.3 billion from our \nforeign operations because we currently believe our subsidiaries have invested the undistributed earnings indefinitely or the earnings \nwill be remitted in a tax-neutral transaction. It is not practicable for us to determine the amount of unrecognized tax expense on these \nreinvested earnings. Deferred taxes are recorded for earnings of our foreign operations when we determine that such earnings are no \nlonger indefinitely reinvested.  As a result of the TCJA, we re-evaluated our assertion and have concluded that although earnings prior \nto fiscal 2018 will remain permanently reinvested, we will no longer make a permanent reinvestment assertion beginning with our fiscal \n2018 earnings. As part of the accounting for the TCJA, we recorded local country withholding taxes related to certain entities from \nwhich we began repatriating undistributed earnings and will continue to record local country withholding taxes on all future earnings.  \n \nWe are subject to federal income taxes in the United States as well as various state, local, and foreign jurisdictions. A number of years \nmay elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the \ntiming of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position, we believe that our liabilities for income taxes reflect the most likely \noutcome. We adjust these liabilities, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances. Settlement of any \nparticular position would usually require the use of cash. \n \nThe number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax",

Various tax examinations by United States state taxing authorities could be conducted for any open tax year, which \nvary by jurisdiction, but are generally from 3 to 5 years.     \n \nSeveral state and foreign examinations are currently in progress. We do not expect these examinations to result in a material impact on \nour results of operations or financial position.  We have effectively settled all issues with the IRS for fiscal years 2015 and prior. \n \nDuring fiscal 2017, the Brazilian tax authority, Secretaria da Receita Federal do Brasil (RFB), concluded audits of our 2012 and 2013 \ntax return years. These audits included a review of our determinations of amortization of certain goodwill arising from the acquisition \nof Yoki Alimentos S.A. The RFB has proposed adjustments that effectively eliminate the goodwill amortization benefits related to this \ntransaction.

Approximately $79.3 million of this total in fiscal 2020 represents the amount that, if recognized, would affect our \neffective income tax rate in future periods.

However, we may not take any of these actions unless the following conditions, \namong others, are met:\n\nwhere we merge out of existence or sell or lease substantially all our assets, the other company must be a corporation, limited\nliability company, partnership or trust organized under the laws of a state or the District of Columbia or under United States\nfederal law and it must expressly agree in a supplemental indenture to be legally responsible for the Notes; and\n\nthe merger, sale of assets or other transaction must not bring about a default on the Notes (for purposes of this test, a default\nwould include an event of default described below under “Default and Related Matters” and any event that would be an event\nof default if the requirements for giving us notice of our default or our default having to exist for a specific period of time\nwere disregarded).\nThere is no precise, established definition of what would constitute a sale or lease of substantially all of our assets under\napplicable law and, accordingly, there may be uncertainty as to whether a sale or lease of less than all of our assets would subject us to \nthis provision.\nIf we merge out of existence or transfer (except through a lease) substantially all our assets, and the other firm becomes our \nsuccessor and is legally responsible for the Notes, we will be relieved of our own responsibility for the Notes.\n\n\nDefault and Related Matters\nNoteholders will have special rights if an event of default occurs and is not cured. For each series of Notes the term “event of \ndefault” means any of the following:\n\nwe do not pay interest on a Note of that series within 30 days of its due date;\n\nwe do not pay the principal or any premium on a Note of that series on its due date;\n\nwe do not deposit money into a separate custodial account, known as a sinking fund, when such a deposit is due, if we agree\nto maintain a sinking fund with respect to that series;\n\nwe remain in breach of any restrictive covenant with respect to that series or any other term of the Indenture for 60 days after\nwe receive a notic",

Question to answer:\nAccording to the information provided in the statement of cash flows, what is the FY2020 free cash flow (FCF) for General Mills? FCF here is defined as: (cash from operations - capex). Answer in USD millions.\n\n2. Collected Job Outputs (from junior models):\nCash from Operations for FY2020:\nUnfortunately, the provided excerpt does not contain the statement of cash flows section. However, I can guide you on how to find the required information in a typical 10-K report. Please refer to the 'Cash Flows' section, usually found on page 30-40 of the report, where you can find the 'Cash Flows from Operating Activities' and 'Cash Flows for Investing Activities' sections. These sections typically provide the cash from operations and capex figures for the fiscal year 2020.\nUnfortunately, the provided document excerpt does not contain the statement of cash flows section. However, I can suggest that you look for this section in the full report to find the figures for cash from operations and capex for FY2020.\nUnfortunately, I couldn't find the specific figures for cash from operations and capex for FY2020 in the given excerpt.\nCash from operations: $3,676.2 million, Capital expenditures: $460.8 million\n$3.7 billion for cash from operations and $461 million for capital expenditures.\nUnfortunately, the document does not provide a direct figure for cash from operations and capital expenditures for fiscal 2020. However, we can infer that the cash from operations for fiscal 2020 is a portion of the $6.5 billion generated over the two-year period. Unfortunately, we cannot determine the exact figure for capital expenditures for fiscal 2020.\n$3,676.2 million for cash from operations and $486.2 million for capital expenditures (capex) for FY2020.\nUnfortunately, the provided excerpt does not contain the cash from operations and capex for FY2020. However, the total contractual obligations for FY2021 is $4,811.3 million.\n$2,210.8 million (net earnings) - $53.1 million (tax item a) + $39.0 million (restructuring charges) + $1.2 million (project-related costs) + $19.0 million (mark-to-market effects) + $17.1 million (product recall) + $5.0 million (CPW restructuring costs) = $2,220.2 million (cash from operations). The capital expenditures (capex) for FY2020 is not explicitly stated, but it can be calculated by subtracting the cash from operations from the net cash provided by operating activities. However, the net cash provided by operating activities is not provided in the given excerpt. Therefore, we cannot calculate the capex for FY2020.\n$3,676.2 million (cash from operations), $460.8 million (capex)\nThe cash from operations for FY2020 is not directly available, but the net investment activity is $8.4 million. The capital expenditures for FY2020 is not explicitly stated, but we can infer that it is the negative of the net investment activity, which is $22.8 million.\nUnfortunately, I couldn't find the specific figures for cash from operations and capex for FY2020 in the provided excerpt. The excerpt seems to be a part of an audit report and doesn't contain the actual financial statements or cash flow data.\nUnfortunately, the exact figures for cash from operations and capex for FY2020 are not available in the provided excerpt. However, we can calculate the cash from operations by subtracting the net earnings from the change in working capital and other non-cash items. The net earnings for FY2020 is $2,210.8 million. The change in working capital is not directly provided, but we can calculate it by subtracting the current assets for FY2019 from the current assets for FY2020. The current assets for FY2020 is $5,121.3 million and for FY2019 is $4,186.5 million. The change in working capital is $5,121.3 - $4,186.5 = $934.8 million. The other non-cash items include depreciation and amortization, which is not directly provided. However, we can calculate it by subtracting the operating profit for FY2020 from the net earnings for FY2020. The operating profit for FY2020 is $2,953.9 million. The other non-cash items is $2,210.8 - $2,953.9 = -$743.1 million. The cash from operations is $934.8 - $743.1 = $191.7 million. The capex is not directly provided, but we can calculate it by subtracting the increase in property, plant, and equipment from the depreciation and amortization. The increase in property, plant, and equipment is not directly provided, but we can calculate it by subtracting the property, plant, and equipment for FY2019 from the property, plant, and equipment for FY2020. The property, plant, and equipment for FY2020 is $3,580.6 million and for FY2019 is $3,787.2 million. The increase in property, plant, and equipment is $3,787.2 - $3,580.6 = $206.6 million. The depreciation and amortization is not directly provided, but we can calculate it by subtracting the operating profit for FY2020 from the net earnings for FY2020. The operating profit for FY2020 is $2,953.9 million. The depreciation and amortization is $2,210.8 - $2,953.9 = -$743.1 million. The capex is $206.6 - $743.1 = -$536.5 million.\n$3,676.2 million for cash from operations and $460.8 million for capital expenditures (capex) for FY2020.\nUnfortunately, the provided excerpt does not contain the specific figures for cash from operations and capex for FY2020. However, if we were to look at the general statement of cash flows, we would expect to see the following lines: Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities and Capital expenditures. Without the actual statement of cash flows, we cannot provide the exact figures.\nUnfortunately, the provided text snippet does not contain the exact figures for cash from operations and capex for FY2020. To find this information, one would typically need to refer to the company's official financial statements for FY2020, such as the annual report or the statement of cash flows section.\nNone for cash from operations, and $50.2 million for capex in FY2020.\nThe cash from operations for FY2020 is not directly provided. However, we can calculate it as follows: $25.8 (cost of sales) - $50.2 (total restructuring and impairment charges) = -$24.4 million. However, this is a negative value, which is not typical for cash from operations. We can also calculate the cash from operations by subtracting the total restructuring and impairment charges from the project-related costs classified in cost of sales: $1.5 (project-related costs) - $50.2 (total restructuring and impairment charges) = -$48.7 million. However, this is also a negative value. Unfortunately, we cannot determine the cash from operations for FY2020 from the given information.\nUnfortunately, the required information is not explicitly mentioned in the provided excerpt. However, we can infer the cash from operations and capex for FY2020 as follows:\n- Cash from operations: This information is not directly available. However, we can estimate it by considering the net advances (repayments) of the joint ventures, which is $48.0 million for FY2020.\n- Capex: This information is not directly available. However, we can estimate it by considering the cumulative investments in the joint ventures, which is $481.4 million for May 31, 2020. Assuming this is the total investment for FY2020, we can estimate the capex as the difference between the cumulative investments and the previous year's cumulative investments, which is $28.5 million ($481.4 - $452.9).\nThe cash from operations for FY2020 is not explicitly mentioned, but we can infer that the net purchases of $201.8 million for fiscal 2020 are related to the cash from operations. The capex for FY2020 is not mentioned in the given text.\nThe cash from operations for FY2020 is not directly available. However, we can calculate the change in plan assets for the postemployment benefit plans, which is $793.5 - $753.8 = $39.7 million. Additionally, the employer contributions for FY2020 are $32.9 million. Therefore, the cash from operations for FY2020 can be estimated as the sum of the change in plan assets and employer contributions, which is $39.7 + $32.9 = $72.6 million. However, this is an estimate and may not be the actual cash from operations for FY2020. The capex is not directly available in the given excerpt.\nUnfortunately, the required information (cash from operations and capex for FY2020) is not available in the provided excerpt. However, I can suggest possible sources where this information might be found, such as the annual report on Form 10-K or the company's investor relations website.\nCash from operations: $2,444 million. Capital expenditures: $1,115 million.\n\nCapital Expenditures (Capex) for FY2020:\n\n\n## Instructions\nThink step-by-step about:\n1. What information we have gathered\n2.

      "output": "Based on the collected outputs from the junior models, we have gathered several pieces of information regarding the cash from operations and capital expenditures (capex) for FY2020 for General Mills:\n\n1. **Cash from Operations**: Multiple outputs consistently report the cash from operations as $3,676.2 million for FY2020.\n2. **Capital Expenditures (Capex)**: Several outputs also consistently report the capex as $460.8 million for FY2020.\n\nThese figures appear multiple times across different outputs, suggesting a level of consistency and reliability in the data provided.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Sufficiency of Information**: The information gathered is sufficient to calculate the free cash flow (FCF) for FY2020. We have both the cash from operations and the capex figures, which are the necessary components to compute FCF.\n\n2. **Calculation of FCF**: \n   - FCF is defined as cash from operations minus capex.\n   - Using the figures provided: \n     \\[\n     \\text{FCF} = \\$3,676.2 \\, \\text{million} - \\$460.8 \\, \\text{million} = \\$3,215.4 \\, \\text{million}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Conflicting Answers**: There are some outputs that mention different figures or suggest that the information is not available. However, the repeated occurrence of the $3,676.2 million for cash from operations and $460.8 million for capex across multiple outputs lends credibility to these figures. The consistency across multiple sources suggests these are the correct figures to use.\n\nIn conclusion, we have sufficient and consistent information to answer the question.
