  "question": "Based on the information provided primarily in the balance sheet and the statement of income, what is FY2020 days payable outstanding (DPO) for Corning? DPO is defined as: 365 * (average accounts payable between FY2019 and FY2020) / (FY2020 COGS + change in inventory between FY2019 and FY2020). Round your answer to two decimal places.",
  "predicted_answer": "The FY2020 days payable outstanding (DPO) for Corning is calculated as follows: \n\n1. Average Accounts Payable = ((1,024 + 1,174) / 2 + (2,320 + 1,508) / 2) / 2 = 1,506.5M\n2. Change in Inventory = ((1,139 - 2,438) + (7,772 - 503)) / 2 = 2,985M\n3. DPO = 365 * 1,506.5 / (9,383 + 2,985) = 365 * 1,506.5 / 12,368 = 44.47 days\n\nTherefore, the FY2020 DPO for Corning is 44.47 days.",
