--- Question ---
Does AMEX have an improving operating margin profile as of 2022? If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
Operating margin is a relevant metric for American Express (AMEX) as it provides insights into the company's profitability and cost management. The document excerpts highlight the importance of managing costs and maintaining profitability, which are key components of operating margin. However, the document does not provide a comprehensive discussion on operating margin trends or changes.

--- Ground Truth ---
['Performance is not measured through operating margin']

--- Correctness Evaluation ---
Is correct: False
Confidence: 0.80
Reasoning: The ground truth states that performance is not measured through operating margin for AMEX, implying that operating margin is not a useful metric for evaluating the company's performance. The predicted answer suggests that operating margin is relevant and provides insights into profitability and cost management, which contradicts the ground truth. Therefore, the predicted answer does not align with the key conclusion of the ground truth.
