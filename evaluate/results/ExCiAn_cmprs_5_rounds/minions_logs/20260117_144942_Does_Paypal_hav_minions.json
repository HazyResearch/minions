If working capital is not a useful or relevant metric for this company, then please state that and explain why.\n\n---\n\nPlease provide succinct advice on the critical information we need to extract from the Financial document. Total length: 483929 characters to answer this question. \n\nAlso consider the following constraints:\n- In your response do NOT use numbered lists.\n- Do NOT structure your response as a sequence of steps.\n",
      "output": "To determine if PayPal has positive working capital based on FY2022 data, focus on extracting key financial figures from the balance sheet. Specifically, identify the current assets and current liabilities. Working capital is calculated as current assets minus current liabilities. If the result is positive, PayPal has positive working capital. \n\nHowever, consider the nature of PayPal's business model. As a financial services and technology company, traditional working capital metrics might not fully capture its liquidity and operational efficiency. PayPal's business involves significant cash flows and transactions that can affect its current asset and liability figures differently than in traditional industries. Therefore, while working capital can provide insight, it may not be the most relevant metric for assessing PayPal's financial health. Instead, cash flow statements and liquidity ratios might offer a more comprehensive view. \n\nIn summary, extract the current assets and liabilities to calculate working capital, but also consider the broader context of PayPal's business model and other financial metrics that might be more indicative of its financial position."

Instead, you can assign small, isolated tasks to a less capable worker model that sees only a single chunk of text at a time. Any cross-chunk or multi-document reasoning must be handled by you.\n\n## Your Job: Write Two Python Functions\n\n### FUNCTION #1: `prepare_jobs(context, prev_job_manifests, prev_job_outputs) -> List[JobManifest]`\n- Break the document(s) into chunks (using the provided chunking function, if needed). Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 12 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`. All **multi-chunk integration** or **global reasoning** is your responsibility here.\n- Return one **aggregated string** suitable for further supervisor inspection.\n\n\n\n## Relevant Pydantic Models\n\nThe following models are already in the global scope. **Do NOT redefine or re-import them.**\n\n### JobManifest Model\n```\nclass JobManifest(BaseModel):\n    chunk: str  # the actual text for the chunk of the document\n    task: str  # the actual task instruction for the small model\n    advice: str  # optional, any additional advice on how to perform the task\n\n    chunk_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    task_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    job_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n\n```\n\n### JobOutput Model\n```\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    citation: Optional[str]\n    answer: Optional[str]\n\n```\n\n## Function Signatures\n```\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        context (List[str]): A list of documents.

A critical element of our overall growth\nstrategy involves increasing the engagement of our active accounts, which we expect will contribute to growth in payment transactions, total payment volume,\nand net revenues.

Interchange fees associated with four-party payments systems are being reviewed or challenged in various jurisdictions. For example, in the\nEU, the Multilateral Interchange Fee Regulation caps interchange fees for credit and debit card payments and provides for business rules to be complied with\nby any company dealing with payment card transactions, including PayPal.

Our business relies on the processing of personal data in many\njurisdictions and the movement of data across national borders. As a result, much of the personal data that we process, which may include certain financial\ninformation associated with individuals, is subject to one or more privacy and data protection laws in one or more jurisdictions. In many cases, these laws apply\nnot only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between or among us, our subsidiaries, and other parties with which we have\ncommercial relationships.\nRegulatory scrutiny of privacy, data protection, cybersecurity practices, and the processing of personal data is increasing around the world. Regulatory\nauthorities are continuously considering numerous legislative and regulatory proposals and interpretive guidelines that may contain additional privacy and data\nprotection obligations.

Our goal is to enable our merchants and consumers to manage and move their money anywhere in\nthe world in the markets we serve, anytime, on any platform, and using any device when sending payments or getting paid, including person-to-person\npayments.\nRegulatory environment\nWe operate globally and in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment characterized by a heightened focus by regulators globally on all aspects of the payments\nindustry, including countering terrorist financing, anti-money laundering, privacy, cybersecurity, and consumer protection. The laws and regulations applicable\nto us, including those enacted prior to the advent of digital payments, continue to evolve through legislative and regulatory action and judicial interpretation.\nNew or changing laws and regulations, including changes to their interpretation and implementation, as well as increased penalties and enforcement actions\nrelated to non-compliance, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We monitor these areas closely\nand are focused on designing compliant solutions for our customers.\n33\n\n\nTable of Contents\nInformation security\nInformation security risks for global payments and technology companies like us have increased significantly in recent years. Although we have developed\nsystems and processes designed to protect the data we manage, prevent data loss and other security incidents, and effectively respond to known and potential\nrisks, and expect to continue to expend significant resources to bolster these protections, we remain subject to these risks and there can be no assurance that our\nsecurity measures will provide sufficient security or prevent breaches or attacks. For additional information regarding our information security risks, see “Item\n1A. Risk Factors—Cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could result in serious harm to our reputation, business, and financial condition.”\nRUSSIA AND UKRAINE CONFLICT\nWith respect to the military hostilities commenced by Russia in Ukraine in February 2022, our priority is the safety and well-being of our PayPal employee\ncommunity impacted by these events.

We are currently unable to determine the longer-term impact that Brexit will have on our\nbusiness, which will depend, in part, on the implications of new tariff, trade, and regulatory frameworks that now govern the provision of cross-border goods\nand services between the U.K. and the EEA, as well as the financial and operational consequences of the requirement for PayPal (Europe) to obtain new U.K.\nauthorizations to operate its business longer-term within the U.K. market. For additional information on how Brexit could affect our business, see “Item 1A.\nRisk Factors—Brexit: The U.K.'s departure from the EU could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.”\nBrexit may contribute to instability in financial, stock, and foreign currency exchange markets, including volatility in the value of the British Pound and Euro.\nWe have foreign currency exchange exposure management programs designed to help reduce the impact from foreign currency exchange rate movements.

The strengthening or weakening of the United States\n(“U.S.”) dollar versus the British pound, Euro, Australian dollar, and Canadian dollar, as well as other currencies in which we conduct our international\noperations, impacts the translation of our net revenues and expenses generated in these foreign currencies into the U.S. dollar.

Because we generate substantial\nnet revenues internationally, we are subject to the risks of doing business outside of the U.S., including those discussed under “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”\nWe calculate the year-over-year impact of foreign currency exchange movements on our business using prior period foreign currency exchange rates applied to\ncurrent period transactional currency amounts.

The number of payment transactions per active account provides management with insight into the average\nnumber of times an account engages in payments activity on our payments platform in a given period. The number of times a consumer account or a\nmerchant account transacts on our platform may vary significantly from the average number of payment transactions per active account.\nAs our transaction revenue is typically correlated with TPV growth and the number of payment transactions completed on our payments platform, management\nuses these metrics to gain insights into the scale and strength of our payments platform, the engagement level of our customers, and underlying activity and\ntrends which may be indicators of current and future performance. We present these key metrics to enhance investors’ evaluation of the performance of our\nbusiness and operating results.\nOur key metrics are calculated using internal company data based on the activity we measure on our payments platform and compiled from multiple systems,\nincluding systems that are internally developed or acquired through business combinations. While the measurement of our key metrics is based on what we\nbelieve to be reasonable methodologies and estimates, there are inherent challenges and limitations in measuring our key metrics globally at our scale. The\nmethodologies used to calculate our key metrics require judgment.\nWe regularly review our processes for calculating these key metrics, and from time to time we may make adjustments to improve the accuracy or relevance of\nour metrics. For example, we continuously apply models, processes, and practices designed to detect and prevent fraudulent account creation on our platforms,\nand work to improve and enhance those capabilities. When we detect a significant volume of illegitimate activity, we generally remove the activity identified\nfrom our key metrics. Although such adjustments may impact key metrics reported in prior periods, we generally do not update previously reported key metrics\nto reflect these subsequent adjustments unless the retrospective impact of process improvements or enhancements is determined by management to be material.\nNET REVENUES\nOur revenues are classified into the following two categories:\n•\nTransaction revenues: Net transaction fees charged to merchants and consumers on a transaction basis based on the TPV completed on our payments\nplatform. Growth in TPV is directly impacted by the number of payment transactions that we enable on our payments platform. We earn additional\nfees from merchants and consumers: on transactions where we perform currency conversion, when we enable cross-border transactions (i.e.,\ntransactions where the merchant and consumer are in different countries), to facilitate the instant transfer of funds for our customers from their PayPal\nor Venmo account to their bank account or debit card, to facilitate the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies, as contractua",

This growth in transaction revenues was partially offset by a decline in TPV and revenue generated\nfrom our core PayPal products and services, including foreign currency exchange fees revenue, due primarily to a decrease in revenue earned on eBay’s\nmarketplace platform. Additionally, for the year ended December 31, 2022, transaction revenues included $190 million in contractual compensation from\nsellers that violated our contractual terms, compared to $82 million in the year ended December 31, 2021.

Growth in revenues from other value added services\nin the current period was partially offset by the impact of revenue earned from the servicing of loans facilitated under the U.S. Government’s Paycheck\nProtection Program in 2021 of $157 million, for which revenue was de minimis in the current period.\nConsumers that have outstanding loans and interest receivable due to the partner institution may experience hardships that result in losses recognized by the\npartner institution, which may result in a decrease in our revenue share earned in future periods. In the event the overall return on the PayPal branded credit\nprograms funded by the partner institution does not meet a minimum rate of return (“minimum return threshold”) in a particular quarter, our revenue share for\nthat period would be zero. Further, in the event the overall return on the PayPal branded credit programs managed by the partner institution does not meet the\nminimum return threshold as measured over four consecutive quarters and in the following quarter, we would be required to make a payment to the partner\ninstitution, subject to certain limitations. Through December  31, 2022, the overall return on the PayPal branded credit programs funded by the partner\ninstitution exceeded the minimum return threshold.\nSeasonality\nThe Company does not experience meaningful seasonality with respect to net revenues.

These costs include fees paid to payment\nprocessors and other financial institutions when we draw funds from a customer’s credit or debit card, bank account, or other funding source they have stored\nin their digital wallet. We refer to the allocation of funding sources used by our consumers as our “funding mix.” The cost of funding a transaction with a credit\nor debit card is generally higher than the cost of funding a transaction from a bank or through internal sources such as a PayPal or Venmo account balance or\nour consumer credit products. As we expand the availability and presentation of alternative funding sources to our customers, our funding mix may change,\nwhich could increase or decrease our transaction expense rate. The cost of funding a transaction is also impacted by the geographic region or country in which\na transaction occurs, as we generally pay lower rates for transactions funded with credit or debit cards outside the U.S. Our transaction expense rate is impacted\nby changes in product mix, merchant mix, regional mix, funding mix, and fees paid to payment processors and other financial institutions. Macroeconomic\nenvironment changes may also result in behavioral shifts in consumer spending patterns affecting the type of funding source they use, which could also impact\nthe funding mix.\nTransaction expense increased by $1.9 billion, or 18%, in 2022 compared to 2021 due primarily to an increase in TPV of 9% and unfavorable changes in\nproduct mix. The increase in transaction expense rate in 2022 compared to 2021 was also attributable to unfavorable changes in product mix with a higher\nproportion of TPV from unbranded card processing volume, which generally has higher expense rates than other products and services. For the years ended\nDecember 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, approximately 35%, 39%, and 40% of TPV, respectively, was generated outside of the U.S.\nTransaction and credit losses\nTransaction losses include the expense associated with our customer protection programs, fraud, and chargebacks.

Our transaction and credit losses fluctuate depending on many factors,\nincluding TPV, product mix, current and projected macroeconomic conditions such as unemployment rates, retail e-commerce sales and household disposable\nincome, merchant insolvency events, changes to and usage of our customer protection programs, the impact of regulatory changes, and the credit quality of\nloans receivable arising from transactions funded with our credit products for consumers and loans and advances to merchants. Estimating our current expected\ncredit loss allowances for our loans receivable portfolios is an inherently uncertain process and the ultimate losses we incur may vary from the current\nestimates. We regularly update our allowance estimates as new facts become known and events occur that may impact the ultimate losses incurred. A\ndeterioration in macroeconomic conditions or other factors beyond those considered in our estimates could result in credit losses that exceed our current\nestimated credit losses and adversely impact our future operating results.\n40\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe components of our transaction and credit losses for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 were as follows (in millions):\nTransaction and credit losses increased by $512 million, or 48%, in 2022 compared to 2021.\nTransaction losses were approximately $1.2 billion for both 2022 and 2021, reflecting an increase of $17 million, or 1%.

The increase in transaction losses\nin 2022 was attributable to an increase in losses related to our Venmo products and services resulting from fraud schemes, an increase in goods and services\ntransactions which are now eligible for coverage by our protection programs, and a loss related to a merchant insolvency proceeding, which was offset by\nrecoveries attributable to enhancements in our fraud recoupment capabilities and benefits from continued risk mitigation strategies. In the second quarter of\n2022, we recorded a $114 million estimated loss related to the above mentioned merchant insolvency proceeding, and in the fourth quarter of 2022, this\nestimated loss was reduced by approximately $75 million to account for recoveries and changes in our estimated loss reserve.\nCredit losses increased by $495 million in 2022 compared to 2021.

Our transaction and credit losses fluctuate depending on many factors, including: total TPV, product mix, current and projected\nmacroeconomic conditions, merchant insolvency events, changes to and usage of our customer protection programs, the impact of regulatory changes, and the\ncredit quality of loans receivable arising from transactions funded with our credit products, which include revolving and installment credit products offered to\nconsumers at checkout, and merchant loans and advances arising from the PayPal Working Capital and PayPal Business Loan products.\nWe establish allowances for negative customer balances and estimated transaction losses arising from processing customer transactions, such as chargebacks\nfor unauthorized credit card use and merchant-related chargebacks due to non-delivery or unsatisfactory delivery of purchased items, purchase protection\nprogram claims, account takeovers, and Automated Clearing House returns. Additions to the allowance, in the form of provisions, are reflected in transaction\nand credit losses on our consolidated statements of income (loss). The allowances are based on known facts and circumstances, internal factors including\nexperience with similar cases, historical trends involving collection and write-off patterns, and the mix of transaction and loss types, as well as current and\nprojected macroeconomic factors, as appropriate.\nWe also establish an allowance for loans and interest receivable, which represents our estimate of current expected credit losses inherent in our portfolio of\nloans and interest receivable.

Projected loss rates, inclusive of historical loss\ndata and macroeconomic factors, are applied to the principal amount of our merchant and consumer receivables. Our consumer receivables consist of revolving\nproducts, which do not have a contractual term, and installment products. The reasonable and supportable forecast period for revolving products, installment\nproducts, and merchant products that we have included in our projected loss rates for 2022, which approximates the estimated life of the loans, is\napproximately 2 years, approximately 7 months to 3.5 years, and approximately 2.5 to 3.5 years, respectively. In 2021, the reasonable and supportable forecast\nperiods were consistent with 2022 except for installment products, which had an estimated life of 7 months to 2.5 years. We also include qualitative\nadjustments that incorporate incremental information not captured in the quantitative estimates of our current expected credit losses.

Significant judgment is required in\ndetermining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. We review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the\nbalances as new information becomes available. Our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rates that apply to our foreign earnings. In addition to\nlocal country tax laws and regulations, our income tax rate depends on the extent that our foreign earnings are taxed by the U.S. through provisions such as the\nGILTI tax and base erosion anti-abuse tax or as a result of our indefinite reinvestment assertion. Indefinite reinvestment is determined by management’s\njudgment about, and intentions concerning, our future operations.\nDeferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. Such assets arise because of temporary\ndifferences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We evaluate\nthe recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of\ntaxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings, and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely heavily on estimates that are\nbased on a number of factors, including our historical experience and short-range and long-range business forecasts. To the extent deferred tax assets are not\nexpected to be realized, we record a valuation allowance.\nWe recognize and measure uncertain tax positions in accordance with U.S. GAAP, pursuant to which we only recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax\nposition if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the\nposi",

U.S. GAAP further requires that a change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions\nbe recognized in earnings in the quarter in which such change occurs. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income\ntax expense.\nWe file annual income tax returns in multiple taxing jurisdictions around the world. A number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited by\nthe relevant tax authorities and finally resolved.

Evaluating whether these incentives are a payment to a customer, or consideration\npayable on behalf of a customer, requires judgment. Incentives determined to be made to a customer, or payable on behalf of a customer, are recorded as a\nreduction to gross revenue. Changes in judgments with respect to these assumptions and estimates could impact the amount of revenue recognized.\nVALUATION OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES\nThe valuation of assets acquired in a business combination requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions. The acquisition method of accounting for\nbusiness combinations requires us to estimate the fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in an acquired business to\nproperly allocate purchase price consideration between assets that are depreciated or amortized and goodwill. Our estimates are based upon assumptions that\nwe believe to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. These valuations require the use of management’s assumptions, which do\nnot reflect unanticipated events and circumstances that may occur.\nEVALUATION OF STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS FOR IMPAIRMENT\nWe have strategic investments in non-marketable equity securities, which include investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value and are\nmeasured at cost minus impairment, if any, and are adjusted for changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or\nsimilar investment in the same issuer (the Measurement Alternative). We review these investments regularly to determine if impairment has occurred. We\nassess whether an impairment loss on these non-marketable equity securities, which are primarily investments in privately held companies, has occurred based\non qualitative factors such as the companies’ financial condition and business outlook, industry performance, regulatory, economic or technological\nenvironment, and other relevant events and factors affecting the company. When indicators of impairment exist, we estimate the fair value of these non-\nmarketable equity securities using the market approach and/or the income approach. If any impairment is identified, we write down the investment to its fair\nvalue and record the corresponding charge through other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of income (loss). Estimating fair value requires\njudgment and use of estimates such as discount rates, forecasted cash flows, and market data of comparable companies, among others.\nITEM 7A.

Management establishes and oversees the implementation of policies governing our\ninvesting, funding, and foreign currency derivative activities intended to mitigate market risks. We monitor risk exposures on an ongoing basis.\n53\n\n\nTable of Contents\nINTEREST RATE RISK\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk relating to our investment portfolio and from interest-rate sensitive assets underlying the customer balances we hold on our\nconsolidated balance sheets as customer accounts.\nAs of December  31, 2022 and 2021, approximately 57% and 40%, respectively, of our total cash, cash equivalents, and investment portfolio (excluding\nrestricted cash and strategic investments) was held in cash and cash equivalents. The remaining portfolio and assets underlying the customer balances that we\nhold on our consolidated balance sheets as customer accounts are maintained in interest and non-interest bearing bank deposits, time deposits, and available-\nfor-sale debt securities. We seek to preserve principal while holding eligible liquid assets, as defined by applicable regulatory requirements and commercial law\nin certain jurisdictions where we operate, equal to at least 100% of the aggregate amount of all customer balances. We do not pay interest on amounts due to\ncustomers.\nInterest rate movements affect the interest income we earn on cash and cash equivalents, time deposits, and available-for-sale debt securities and the fair value\nof those securities. A hypothetical 100 basis points increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our cash equivalents and\navailable-for-sale debt securities investment by approximately $161 million and $272 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Changes in the fair\nvalue of our available-for-sale debt securities resulting from such interest rate changes are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive\nincome (“AOCI”) and are realized only if we sell the securities prior to their scheduled maturities or the declines in fair values are due to expected credit losses.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had $10.4 billion and $9.0 billion, respectively, in fixed rate debt with varying maturity dates. Since these notes bear\ninterest at fixed rates, they do not result in any financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates. However, the fair value of these notes\nfluctuates when interest rates change, increasing in periods of declining interest rates and declining in periods of increasing interest rates.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we also had revolving credit facilities of approximately $5.7 billion and $5.2 billion, respectively, available to us.

As a result, we are exposed to the risk related to fluctuations in interest\nrate to the extent of our borrowings. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had ¥64.3 billion (approximately $491 million) and ¥11.3 billion (approximately\n$98 million), respectively, outstanding under these credit facilities. A 100 basis points hypothetical adverse change in applicable market interest rates would not\nhave resulted in a material impact to interest expense recorded in the period. For additional information, see “Note 12—Debt” in the notes to the consolidated\nfinancial statements included in this Form 10-K.\nInterest rates may also adversely impact our customers’ spending levels and ability and willingness to pay outstanding amounts owed to us. Higher interest\nrates often lead to larger payment obligations by customers of our credit products to us, or to lenders under mortgage, credit card, and other consumer and\nmerchant loans, which may reduce our customers’ ability to remain current on their obligations to us and therefore lead to increased delinquencies, charge-offs,\nand allowances for loans and interest receivable, which could have an adverse effect on our net income (loss).\nFOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK\nWe have significant operations internationally that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound, Euro, Australian dollar, and Canadian\ndollar, which subject us to foreign currency exchange rate risk and may adversely impact our financial results. We transact in various foreign currencies and\nhave significant international revenues and costs. In addition, we charge our international subsidiaries for their use of intellectual property and technology and\nfor certain corporate services. Our cash flows, results of operations, and certain of our intercompany balances that are exposed to foreign currency exchange\nrate fluctuations may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses due to foreign currency fluctuations and related\nhedging activities. We are generally a net receiver of foreign currencies and therefore benefit from a weakening of the United States (“U.S.”) dollar, and are\nadversely affected by a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, relative to foreign currencies. We considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates\nand determined that it was reasonably possible that changes in exchange rates of 10% for all currencies could be experienced in the near term.\n54\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWe have a foreign currency exchange exposure management program designed to identify material foreign currency exposures, manage these exposures, and\nreduce the potential effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated cash flows and results of operations through the execution of foreign currency\nexchange contracts.

These foreign currency exchange contracts are accounted for as derivative instruments; for additional details related to our foreign currency\nexchange contracts, please see “Note 10—Derivative Instruments” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.\nWe use foreign currency exchange forward contracts to protect our forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent earnings and our investment in foreign subsidiaries from\nadverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These hedging contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of adverse foreign currency\nexchange rate movements. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted revenues denominated in foreign currencies and net investment\nhedges for accounting purposes. The derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of AOCI. Cash flow hedges are subsequently reclassified into\nrevenue in the same period the forecasted transaction affects earnings. The accumulated gains and losses associated with net investment hedges will remain in\nAOCI until the foreign subsidiaries are sold or substantially liquidated, at which point they will be reclassified into earnings.\nIf the U.S. dollar weakened by a hypothetical 10% at December 31, 2022 and 2021, the amount recorded in AOCI related to our foreign currency exchange\nforward contracts, before taxes, would have been approximately $710 million and $512 million lower, respectively, before considering the offsetting impact of\nthe underlying hedged item.\nWe have an additional foreign currency exchange management program in which we use foreign currency exchange contracts to offset the foreign currency\nexchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries. These contracts are not designated\nas hedging instruments and reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. The foreign\ncurrency exchange gains and losses on our assets and liabilities are recorded in other income (expense), net, and are offset by the gains and losses on the\nforeign currency exchange contracts.\nAdverse changes in exchange rates of a hypothetical 10% for all foreign currencies would have resulted in a negative impact on income before income taxes of\napproximately $173 million and $196 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, without considering the offsetting effect of foreign currency\nexchange contracts. Foreign currency exchange contracts in place as of December 31, 2022 would have positively impacted income before income taxes by\napproximately $144 million, resulting in a net negative impact of approximately $29 million.

As of\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, our strategic investments totaled $2.1 billion and $3.2 billion which represented approximately 14% and 20% of our total cash,\ncash equivalents, and short-term and long-term investment portfolio at each of those respective dates. Our strategic investments include marketable equity\nsecurities, which are publicly traded, and non-marketable equity securities, which are primarily investments in privately held companies. We are required to\nrecord all adjustments to the value of these strategic investments through our consolidated statements of income (loss). As such, we expect volatility to our net\nincome (loss) in future periods due to changes in fair value related to our investments in marketable equity securities and changes in observable prices related\nto our non-marketable equity securities accounted for under the Measurement Alternative. These changes could be material based on market conditions.\nAdditionally, the financial success of our investments in privately held companies is typically dependent on a liquidity event, such as a public offering,\nacquisition, private sale, or other favorable market event providing the ability to realize appreciation in the value of the investment. A hypothetical adverse\nchange of 10% in the carrying value of our strategic investments as of December 31, 2022, which could be experienced in the near term, would have resulted in\nan incremental decrease of approximately $215 million to the carrying value of the portfolio. We review our non-marketable equity securities accounted for\nunder the Measurement Alternative for impairment when events and circumstances indicate a decline in fair value of such assets below carrying value.

The loss models incorporate various portfolio attributes, as well as\nmacroeconomic factors such as forecasted trends in unemployment, retail e-commerce sales, and household disposable income. The forecasted macroeconomic\nfactors are sourced externally, using a single scenario to reflect the economic conditions applicable to a particular period. Management also includes qualitative\nadjustments that incorporate incremental information not captured in the expected credit loss models.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the allowance for loans receivable is a critical audit matter are (i) the\nhigh degree of auditor subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to certai",

Testing\nmanagement’s process included (i) evaluating the appropriateness of the methodology and certain models; (ii) testing the completeness and accuracy of certain\ndata used in the estimate; and (iii) evaluating the reasonableness of management’s application of macroeconomic forecasts to estimate expected credit losses.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nSan Jose, California\nFebruary 9, 2023\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2000.\n60\n\n\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n \nAs of December 31,\n2022\n2021\n \n(In millions, except par value)\nASSETS\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n7,776 \n$\n5,197 \nShort-term investments\n3,092 \n4,303 \nAccounts receivable, net\n963 \n800 \nLoans and interest receivable, net of allowances of $598 and $491 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively\n7,431 \n4,846 \nFunds receivable and customer accounts\n36,357 \n36,141 \nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\n1,898 \n1,287 \nTotal current assets\n57,517 \n52,574 \nLong-term investments\n5,018 \n6,797 \nProperty and equipment, net\n1,730 \n1,909 \nGoodwill\n11,209 \n11,454 \nIntangible assets, net\n788 \n1,332 \nOther assets\n2,455 \n1,737 \nTotal assets\n$\n78,717 \n$\n75,803 \nLIABILITIES AND EQUITY\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable\n$\n126 \n$\n197 \nFunds payable and amounts due to customers\n40,107 \n38,841 \nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities\n4,055 \n3,755 \nIncome taxes payable\n813 \n236 \nTotal current liabilities\n45,101 \n43,029 \nDeferred tax liability and other long-term liabilities\n2,925 \n2,998 \nLong-term debt\n10,417 \n8,049 \nTotal liabilities\n58,443 \n54,076 \nCommitments and contingencies (Note 13)\nEquity:\nCommon stock, $0.0001 par value; 4,000 shares authorized; 1,136 and 1,168 shares outstanding as of\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively\n— \n— \nPreferred stock, $0.0001 par value; 100 shares authorized, unissued\n— \n— \nTreasury stock at cost, 173 and 132 shares as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively\n(16,079)\n(11,880)\nAdditional paid-in-capital\n18,327 \n17,208 \nRetained earnings\n18,954 \n16,535 \nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\n(928)\n(136)\nTotal equity\n20,274 \n21,727 \nTotal liabilities and equity\n$\n78,717 \n$\n75,803 \nThe accom",

Our goal is to enable our merchants and consumers to manage and move their money anywhere in the world in the markets we serve, anytime, on\nany platform, and using any device when sending payments or getting paid, including person-to-person payments.\nWe operate globally and in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment characterized by a heightened focus by regulators globally on all aspects of the payments\nindustry, including countering terrorist financing, anti-money laundering, privacy, cybersecurity, and consumer protection. The laws and regulations applicable\nto us, including those enacted prior to the advent of digital payments, continue to evolve through legislative and regulatory action and judicial interpretation.\nNew or changing laws and regulations, including changes to their interpretation and implementation, as well as increased penalties and enforcement actions\nrelated to non-compliance, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We monitor these areas closely\nand are focused on designing compliant solutions for our customers.\nSIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of presentation and principles of consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of PayPal and our wholly- and majority-owned subsidiaries. All\nintercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The noncontrolling interest reported in a prior period was a component of\nequity on our consolidated balance sheets and represented the equity interests not owned by PayPal, and was recorded for consolidated entities we controlled\nand of which we owned less than 100%. Noncontrolling interest was not presented separately on our consolidated statements of income (loss) as the amount\nwas de minimis.\nInvestments in entities where we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the investee are accounted for using the equity method\nof accounting. For such investments, our share of the investee’s results of operations is included in other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements\nof income (loss). Investments in entities where we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee are accounted for at fair value or\ncost minus impairment, if any, adjusted for changes resulting from observable price changes, which are included in other income (expense), net on our\nconsolidated statements of income (loss).

If we determine an investment is in a VIE, we then assess if we are the primary beneficiary, which would require\nconsolidation.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had consolidated two VIEs that provided financing for and held loans receivable of Paidy, Inc. (“Paidy”). We were the primary\nbeneficiary of the VIEs as we performed the servicing and collection for the loans receivable, which were the activities that most significantly impacted the\nVIE’s economic performance, and we had the obligation to absorb the losses and/or the right to receive the benefits of the VIE that could potentially be\nsignificant to these entities. The financial results of these VIEs were included in our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2021, the carrying\nvalue of the assets and liabilities of our consolidated VIEs was included as short-term investments of $87 million, loans and interest receivable, net of $21\nmillion, and long-term debt of $98 million. Cash of $87 million, included in short-term investments, was restricted to settle the debt obligations. In the first\nquarter of 2022, we terminated Paidy’s legacy debt structure and replaced it with a new credit agreement executed in February 2022. As a result, we no longer\nhave any consolidated VIEs as of December 31, 2022.

Our maximum exposure to loss related to our nonconsolidated VIEs, which represents funded commitments and any future funding\ncommitments, was $232 million and $205 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nIn the opinion of management, these consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, which are\nnecessary for a fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented.

Operating leases are recorded as right-of-use (“ROU”) assets,\nwhich are included in other assets, and lease liabilities, which are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and deferred tax liability and other\nlong-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. For sale-leaseback transactions, we evaluate the sale and the lease arrangement based on our\nconclusion as to whether control of the underlying asset has been transferred, and recognize the sale-leaseback as either a sale transaction or under the\nfinancing method. The financing method requires the asset to remain on our consolidated balance sheets throughout the term of the lease and the proceeds to be\nrecognized as a financing obligation.\nROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from\nthe lease. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Our\nleases do not provide an implicit rate and therefore we use an incremental borrowing rate for specific terms on a collateralized basis using information available\non the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The ROU asset calculation includes lease payments to be made and excludes\nlease incentives. The ROU asset and lease liability may include amounts attributed to options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain we\nwill exercise that option. When we reach a decision to exercise a lease renewal or termination option, we recognize the associated impact to the ROU asset and\nlease liability. Lease expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nWe evaluate ROU assets related to leases for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an\nROU asset may not be recoverable.

If the reporting unit does not pass the qualitative\nassessment, then the reporting unit’s carrying value is compared to its fair value. Goodwill is considered impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit\nexceeds its fair value. The fair value of the reporting unit may be estimated using income and market approaches. The discounted cash flow method, a form of\nthe income approach, uses expected future operating results and a market participant discount rate. The market approach uses comparable company prices and\nother relevant information generated by market transactions (either publicly traded entities or mergers and acquisitions) to develop pricing metrics to be applied\nto historical and expected future operating results of the reporting unit. Failure to achieve these expected results, changes in the discount rate, or market pricing\nmetrics may cause a future impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit level. We conducted our annual impairment test of goodwill as of August 31, 2022 and\n2021. We determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill of our reporting unit was required. As of December 31, 2022, we determined that no\nevents occurred, or circumstances changed from August 31, 2022 through December 31, 2022 that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the\nreporting unit below its carrying amount.\nIntangible assets consist of acquired customer list and user base intangible assets, marketing related intangibles, developed technology, and other intangible\nassets.

Negative customer balances can be cured by the customer by adding funds to their account, receiving payments,\nor through back-up funding sources. We also utilize third-party collection agencies. For negative customer balances that are not expected to be cured or\notherwise collected, we provide an allowance for expected losses. The allowance represents expected losses based on historical trends involving collection and\nwrite-off patterns, internal factors including our experience with similar cases, other known facts and circumstances, and reasonable and supportable\nmacroeconomic forecasts, as applicable. Loss rates are derived using historical loss data for each delinquency bucket using a roll rate model that captures the\nlosses and the likelihood that a negative customer balance will be written off as the delinquency age of such balance increases. The loss rates are then applied\nto the outstanding negative customer balances. Once the quantitative calculation is performed, we review the adequacy of the allowance and determine if\nqual",

Fair value is defined as the price received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a\nliability in the principal market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Fair value is estimated\nby maximizing the use of observable inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs. The categorization within the following three-level fair value\nhierarchy for our recurring and non-recurring fair value measurements is based upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value\nmeasurement:\n•\nLevel 1 - Observable inputs, such as unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n•\nLevel 2 - Observable inputs other than Level 1 quoted prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are\nnot active or other inputs that are observable or can be market-corroborated.\n•\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs that cannot be directly corroborated by observable market data and that typically reflect management’s estimate of\nassumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.\nSee “Note 9—Fair Value Measurement of Assets and Liabilities” for additional information related to our fair value measurements.\nCrypto asset safeguarding liability and corresponding safeguarding asset\nSee “Note 7—Other Financial Statement Details” for information related to our crypto asset safeguarding liability and corresponding safeguarding asset.\n75\n\n\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nConcentrations of risk\nOur cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, loans and interest receivable, net, funds receivable and customer accounts, long-term\ninvestments, and long-term notes receivable, are potentially subject to concentration of credit risk.

We do not believe any of these new\naccounting pronouncements have had, or will have, a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures.\nNOTE 2—REVENUE\nWe enable our customers to send and receive payments. We earn revenue primarily by completing payment transactions for our customers on our payments\nplatform and from other value added services. Our revenues are classified into two categories: transaction revenues and revenues from other value added\nservices.\nTRANSACTION REVENUES\nWe earn transaction revenues primarily from fees paid by our customers to receive payments on our platform. These fees may have a fixed and variable\ncomponent. The variable component is generally a percentage of the value of the payment amount and is known at the time the transaction is processed. For a\nportion of our transactions, the variable component of the fee is eligible for reimbursement when the underlying transaction is approved for a refund. We\nestimate the amount of fee refunds that will be processed each quarter and record a provision against our transaction revenues. The volume of activity\nprocessed on our payments platform, which results in transaction revenue, is referred to as Total Payment Volume (“TPV”). We earn additional fees from\nmerchants and consumers on transactions where we perform currency conversion, when we enable cross-border transactions (i.e., transactions where the\nmerchant and consumer are in different countries), to facilitate the instant transfer of funds for our customers from their PayPal or Venmo account to their bank\naccount or debit card, to facilitate the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies, as contractual compensation from sellers that violate our contractual terms (for\nexample, through fraud or counterfeiting), and other miscellaneous fees. Our transaction revenues are also reduced by certain incentives provided to our\ncustomers.\nOur contracts with our customers are usually open-ended and can be terminated by either party without a termination penalty after the notice period has lapsed.\nTherefore, our contracts are defined at the transaction level and do not extend beyond the service already provided. Our contracts generally renew\nautomatically without any significant material rights. Some of our contracts include tiered pricing, which are based primarily on volume.

We bear primary responsibility for the\nfulfillment of the payment service, contract directly with our customers, control the product specifications, and define the value proposal from our services.\nFurther, we have full discretion in determining the fee charged to our customers, which is independent of the costs we incur in instances where we may utilize\npayment processors or other financial institutions to perform services on our behalf. We therefore bear full margin risk when completing a payment\ntransaction. These fees paid to payment processors and other financial institutions are recognized as transaction expense. We are also responsible for providing\ncustomer support.\nTo promote engagement and acquire new users on our platform, we may provide incentives to merchants and consumers in various forms including discounts\non fees, rebates, rewards, and coupons. Evaluating whether an incentive is a payment to a customer requires judgment. Incentives that are determined to be\nconsideration payable to a customer or paid on behalf of a customer are recognized as a reduction of revenue.

We seek to mitigate such risk\nby limiting our counterparties to, and by spreading the risk across, major financial institutions and by entering into collateral security arrangements. In addition,\nthe potential risk of loss with any one counterparty resulting from this type of credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis.

We have a foreign\ncurrency exposure management program in which we designate certain foreign currency exchange contracts, generally with maturities of 18 months or less, to\nreduce the volatility of cash flows primarily related to forecasted revenues denominated in foreign currencies. The objective of these foreign currency exchange\ncontracts is to help mitigate the risk that the U.S. dollar-equivalent cash flows are adversely affected by changes in the applicable U.S. dollar/foreign currency\nexchange rate. These derivative instruments are designated as cash flow hedges and accordingly, the derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported as a\ncomponent of AOCI and subsequently reclassified into revenue in the same period the forecasted transaction affects earnings. We evaluate the effectiveness of\nour foreign currency exchange contracts on a quarterly basis by comparing the critical terms of the derivative instruments with the critical terms of the\nforecasted cash flows of the hedged item; if the critical terms are the same, we conclude the hedge will be perfectly effective. We do not exclude any\ncomponent of the changes in fair value of the derivative instruments from the assessment of hedge effectiveness.

The fee on certain of these\nloans or advances remains unchanged over the extended term. Alternatively, certain loans and advances have been modified to replace the initial fixed fee\nstructure at the time the loan or advance was extended with a fixed annual percentage rate applied over the amended remaining term, which will continue to\naccrue interest at the fixed rate until the earlier of maturity or charge-off.

Many of these proceedings are in early stages and may seek an indeterminate amount\nof damages or penalties or may require us to change or adopt certain business practices. If we believe that a loss arising from such matters is probable and can\nbe reasonably estimated, we accrue the estimated liability in our financial statements at that time. If only a range of estimated losses can be determined, we\naccrue an amount within the range that, in our judgment, reflects the most likely outcome; if none of the estimates within that range is a better estimate than\nany other amount, we accrue the low end of the range. For those proceedings in which an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible but not probable, we\nhave disclosed an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of losses or we have concluded that an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of\nlosses arising directly from the proceeding (i.e., monetary damages or amounts paid in judgment or settlement) are not material. If we cannot estimate the\nprobable or reasonably possible loss or range of losses arising from a legal proceeding, we have disclosed that fact. In assessing the materiality of a legal\nproceeding, we evaluate, among other factors, the amount of monetary damages claimed, as well as the potential impact of non-monetary remedies sought by\nplaintiffs (e.g., injunctive relief) that may require us to change our business practices in a manner that could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWith respect to the matters disclosed in this Note 13, we are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of losses that could potentially result from the\napplication of such non-monetary remedies.\nAmounts accrued for legal and regulatory proceedings for which we believe a loss is probable and reasonably estimable were not material for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. Except as otherwise noted for the proceedings described in this Note 13, we have concluded, based on currently available information, that\nreasonably possible losses arising directly from the proceedings (i.e., monetary damages or amounts paid in judgment or settlement) in excess of our recorded\naccruals are also not material. Determining legal reserves or possible losses from such matters involves judgment and may not reflect the full range of\nuncertainties and unpredictable outcomes. We may be exposed to losses in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could be material. If any of our\nestimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of\noperations, or cash flows.\nRegu",

Without this, we cannot definitively calculate working capital.\n\n- **Calculation**: If we assume the current liabilities figure of $18,954 million is accurate, we can calculate working capital as follows:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Working Capital} = \\text{Total Current Assets} - \\text{Total Current Liabilities}\n  \\]\n  Using the provided figures:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Total Current Assets} = 7,776 + 3,604 + 18,958 = 30,338 \\text{ million}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\text{Working Capital} = 30,338 - 18,954 = 11,384 \\text{ million}\n  \\]\n  This suggests PayPal has positive working capital.\n\n- **Conflicting Information**: If there are discrepancies in the liabilities figures, we should rely on the most frequently cited or clearly stated figure. In this case, $18,954 million is the only specific figure provided for 2022, so we use it for our calculation.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the available data, PayPal appears to have positive working capital for FY2022. However, the lack of consistent liability figures means this conclusion should be verified with more precise data if available."
