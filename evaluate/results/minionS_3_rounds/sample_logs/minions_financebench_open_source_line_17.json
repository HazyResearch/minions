  "correctness_reasoning": "The predicted answer correctly identifies that conventional inventory management is not applicable to AES Corporation, which aligns with the ground truth's implication that inventory turnover is not meaningful for the company. The absence of a financial average inventory value supports this conclusion. The ground truth provides a numerical value, but the predicted answer's qualitative assessment is valid given the context."
