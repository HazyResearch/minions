      "output": "To determine Kraft Heinz's FY2019 inventory turnover ratio, focus on extracting specific financial data from the document. You need the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) for FY2019, which is typically found in the Profit and Loss (P&L) statement. Additionally, gather the inventory figures from the balance sheet for both FY2018 and FY2019. Calculate the average inventory by adding the inventory values for these two years and dividing by two. With these figures, compute the inventory turnover ratio by dividing the FY2019 COGS by the average inventory. Ensure that the final result is rounded to two decimal places for precision."

      "prompt": "# Decomposition Round #1\n\nYou (the supervisor) cannot directly read the document(s). Instead, you can assign small, isolated tasks to a less capable worker model that sees only a single chunk of text at a time. Any cross-chunk or multi-document reasoning must be handled by you.\n\n## Your Job: Write Two Python Functions\n\n### FUNCTION #1: `prepare_jobs(context, prev_job_manifests, prev_job_outputs) -> List[JobManifest]`\n- Break the document(s) into chunks (using the provided chunking function, if needed). Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 12 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`. All **multi-chunk integration** or **global reasoning** is your responsibility here.\n- Return one **aggregated string** suitable for further supervisor inspection.\n\n\n\n## Relevant Pydantic Models\n\nThe following models are already in the global scope. **Do NOT redefine or re-import them.**\n\n### JobManifest Model\n```\nclass JobManifest(BaseModel):\n    chunk: str  # the actual text for the chunk of the document\n    task: str  # the actual task instruction for the small model\n    advice: str  # optional, any additional advice on how to perform the task\n\n    chunk_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    task_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    job_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n\n```\n\n### JobOutput Model\n```\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    citation: Optional[str]\n    answer: Optional[str]\n\n```\n\n## Function Signatures\n```\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        context (List[str]): A list of documents.

The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of\npatent, the scope of its coverage as determined by the patent office or courts in the country, and the availability of legal remedies in the country.\nResearch and Development\nOur research and development focuses on achieving the following four objectives:\n•\nproduct innovations, renovations, and new technologies to meet changing consumer needs and drive growth;\n•\nworld-class and uncompromising food safety, quality, and consistency;\n•\nsuperior, customer-preferred product and package performance; and\n•\ncontinuous process improvement and product optimization in pursuit of cost reductions.\nCompetition\nOur products are sold in highly competitive marketplaces, which have experienced increased concentration and the growing presence of e-commerce retailers,\nlarge-format retailers, and discounters. Competitors include large national and international food and beverage companies and numerous local and regional\ncompanies. We compete with both branded and private label products sold by retailers, wholesalers, and cooperatives. We compete on the basis of product\ninnovation, price, product quality, nutritional value, service, taste, convenience, brand recognition and loyalty, effectiveness of marketing and distribution,\npromotional activity, and the ability to identify and satisfy changing consumer preferences. Improving our market position or introducing new products\nrequires substantial advertising and promotional expenditures.\nSales and Customers\nOur products are sold through our own sales organizations and through independent brokers, agents, and distributors to chain, wholesale, cooperative and\nindependent grocery accounts, convenience sto",

In addition, we purchase and use significant quantities of resins, metals, and cardboard to package\nour products and natural gas to operate our facilities. For commodities that we use across many of our product categories, such as corrugated paper and\nenergy, we coordinate sourcing requirements and centralize procurement to leverage our scale. In addition, some of our product lines and brands separately\nsource raw materials that are specific to their operations. We source these commodities from a variety of providers, including large, international producers\nand smaller, local, independent sellers. Where appropriate, we seek to establish preferred purchaser status and have developed strategic partnerships with\nmany of our suppliers with the objective of achieving favorable pricing and dependable supply for many of our commodities. The prices of raw materials that\nwe use in our products are affected by external factors, such as global competition for resources, currency fluctuations, severe weather or global climate\nchange, consumer, industrial or investment demand, and changes in governmental regulation and trade, tariffs, alternative energy, and agricultural programs.\nOur procurement teams monitor worldwide supply and cost trends so we can obtain ingredients ",

Risk Factors.\nIndustry Risks\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry.\nThe food and beverage industry is highly competitive across all of our product offerings. Our principal competitors in these categories are manufacturers, as\nwell as retailers with their own branded and private label products. We compete based on product innovation, price, product quality, nutritional value, service,\ntaste, convenience, brand recognition and loyalty, effectiveness of marketing and distribution, promotional activity, and the ability to identify and satisfy\nchanging consumer preferences.\nWe may need to reduce our prices in response to competitive and customer pressures, including pressures in relation to private label products that are\ngenerally sold at lower prices. These pressures have restricted and may in the future continue to restrict our ability to increase prices in response to\ncommodity and other cost increases. Failure to effectively assess, timely change and set proper pricing, promotions, or trade incentives may negatively impact\nthe achievement of our objectives.\n5\n\n\nThe rapid emergence of new distribution channels, particularly e-commerce, may create consumer price deflation, affecting our retail customer relationships\nand presenting additional challenges to increasing prices in response to commodity or other cost increases. We may also need to increase or reallocate\nspending on marketing, retail trade incentives, materials, advertising, and new product or channel innovation to maintain or increase market share. These\nexpenditures are subject to risks, including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance of our efforts. If we are unable to compete effectively, our\nprofitability, financial condition, and operating results may decline.\nOur success depends on our ability to correctly predict, identify, and interpret changes in consumer preferences and demand, to offer new products to\nmeet those changes, and to respond to competitive innovation.\nConsumer preferences for food and beverage products change continually and rapidly. Our success depends on our ability to predict, identify, and interpret the\ntastes and dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to consumer preferences, including with respect to health and wellness. If we do not\noffer products that appeal to consumers, our sales and market share will decrease, which could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial\ncondition, and operating results.\nWe must distinguish between short-term trends and long-term changes in consumer preferences.

If we fail to expand our product\nofferings successfully across product categories, or if we do not rapidly develop products in faster-growing or more profitable categories, demand for our\nproducts could decrease, which could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results.\nProlonged negative perceptions concerning the health implications of certain food and beverage products (including as they relate to obesity or other health\nconcerns) could influence consumer preferences and acceptance of some of our products and marketing programs. We strive to respond to consumer\npreferences and social expectations, but we may not be successful in our efforts. Continued negative perceptions and failure to satisfy consumer preferences\ncould materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results.\nIn addition, achieving growth depends on our successful development, introduction, and marketing of innovative new products and line extensions. There are\ninherent risks associated with new product or packaging introductions, including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance or potential impacts on\nour existing product offerings. We may be required to increase expenditures for new product development. Successful innovation depends on our ability to\ncorrectly anticipate customer and consumer acceptance, to obtain, protect, and maintain necessary intellectual property rights, and to avoid infringing upon\nthe intellectual property rights of others.

For example, hedging our costs for one of our key commodities, dairy products, is difficult because dairy futures\nmarkets are not as developed as many other commodities futures markets. Continued volatility or sustained increases in the prices of commodities and other\nsupplies we purchase could increase the costs of our products, and our profitability could suffer.

Our remaining businesses are combined and disclosed as “Rest of World.” Rest of World comprises two operating segments: Latin America and\nAPAC.\nDuring the third quarter of 2019, certain organizational changes were announced that will impact our future internal reporting and reportable segments. As a\nresult of these changes, we plan to combine our EMEA, Latin America, and APAC zones to form the International zone. The International zone will be a\nreportable segment along with the United States and Canada in 2020. We also plan to move our Puerto Rico business from the Latin America zone to the\nUnited States zone to consolidate and streamline the management of our product categories and supply chain. These changes will be effective in the first\nquarter of 2020.\nSee Note 22, Segment Reporting, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, to the consolidated financial statements for our financial\ninformation by segment.\nSee below for discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for 2019 compared to 2018.

This\nchange was driven by the operating income/(loss) factors described above (primarily lower impairment losses in 2019 compared to 2018) and favorable\nimpacts in other expense/(income), partially offset by a higher effective tax rate and higher interest expense, detailed as follows.\n•\nOther expense/(income) was $952 million of income in 2019 compared to $168 million of income in 2018. This increase was primarily driven by a\n$420 million net gain on sales of businesses in 2019 compared to a $15 million loss on sale of our South Africa subsidiary in 2018, a $162 million\nnon-cash settlement charge in the prior year related to the wind-up of our Canadian salaried and Canadian hourly defined benefit pension plans, and\na $136 million decrease in nonmonetary currency devaluation losses related to our Venezuelan operations as compared to the prior year period. The\n$420 million net gain on sales of businesses in 2019 consisted of a $249 million gain on the sale of Heinz India Private Limited (“Heinz India”)\n(“Heinz India Transaction”), a $242 million gain on the sale of certain assets in our natural cheese business in Canada (“Canada Natural Cheese\nTransaction”), and a $71 million loss on an anticipated sale of a subsidiary within our Rest of World segment.\n•\nThe effective tax rate was 27.4% in 2019 on pre-tax income compared to 9.4% in 2018 on a pre-tax loss. The 2019 effective tax rate was higher\nprimarily driven by lower non-deductible goodwill impairments, partially offset by a more favorable geographic mix of pre-tax income in various\nnon-U.S. jurisdictions and a decrease in unfavorable rate reconciling items. Current year unfavorable impacts primarily related to non-deductible\ngoodwill impairments, the impact of the federal tax on global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”), an increase in uncertain tax position reserves,\nthe establishment of certain state valuation allowance reserves, and the tax impacts from the Heinz India and Canada Natural Cheese Transactions.\nThese impacts were partially offset by the reversal of certain withholding tax obligations and changes in estimates of certain 2018 U.S. income and\ndeductions.\n23\n\n\n•\nInterest expense was $1.4 billion in 2019 compared to $1.3 billion in 2018. This increase was primarily driven by a $98 million loss on\nextinguishment of debt recognized in connection with our debt tender offers and redemptions completed in 2019. Excluding the impact of the loss on\nextinguishment of debt, interest expense was generally flat as compared to the prior year period.\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased 13.7% to $6.1 billion in 2019 compared to $7.0 billion in 2018.

This decrease was primarily due to\nunfavorable volume/mix (2.4 pp), partially offset by higher pricing (0.4 pp). Unfavorable volume/mix was primarily due to unfavorable changes in retail\ninventory levels versus the prior year and lower shipments in meat, cheese, and coffee, partially offset by growth in nuts as well as condiments and sauces.\nHigher pricing was primarily driven by price increases to reflect higher key-commodity costs for meat and cheese, which more than offset lower key-\ncommodity driven pricing on coffee and nuts.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA decreased 7.8% to $4.8 billion in 2019 compared to $5.2 billion in 2018.

We record revenues net of variable consideration, including consumer incentives and performance obligations related\nto trade promotions, excluding taxes, and including all shipping and handling charges billed to customers (accounting for shipping and handling charges that\noccur after the transfer of control as fulfillment costs). We also record a refund liability for estimated product returns and customer allowances as reductions\nto revenues within the same period that the revenue is recognized. We base these estimates principally on historical and current period experience factors. We\nrecognize costs paid to third party brokers to obtain contracts as expenses as our contracts are generally less than one year.\nAdvertising, Consumer Incentives, and Trade Promotions:\nWe promote our products with advertising, consumer incentives, and performance obligations related to trade promotions. Consumer incentives and trade\npromotions include, but are not limited to, discounts, coupons, rebates, performance-based in-store display activities, and volume-based incentives. Variable\nconsideration related to consumer incentive and trade promotion activities is recorded as a reduction to revenues based on amounts estimated as being due to\ncustomers and consumers at the end of a period. We base these estimates principally on historical utilization, redemption rates, and/or current period\nexperience factors. We review and adjust these estimates at least quarterly based on actual experience and other information.\nAdvertising expenses are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”). For interim reporting purposes, we charge advertising to\noperations as a percentage of estimated full year sales activity and marketing costs. We then review and adjust these estimates each quarter based on actual\nexperience and other information. We recorded advertising expenses of $534 million in 2019, $584 million in 2018, and $629 million in 2017, which\nrepresented costs to obtain physical advertisement spots in television, radio, print, digital, and social channels. We also incur other advertising and marketing\ncosts such as shopper marketing, sponsorships, and agency advertisement conception, design, and public relations fees. Total advertising and marketing costs\nwere $1.1 billion in 2019, 2018, and 2017.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets:\nWe maintain 19 reporting units, 11 of which comprise our goodwill balance. These 11 reporting units had an aggregate carrying amount of $35.5 billion as of\nDecember 28, 2019.

Such events and circumstances could include a\nsustained decrease in our market capitalization, increased competition or unexpected loss of market share, increased input costs beyond projections (for\nexample due to regulatory or industry changes), disposals of significant brands or components of our business, unexpected business disruptions (for example\ndue to a natural disaster or loss of a customer, supplier, or other significant business relationship), unexpected significant declines in operating results,\nsignificant adverse changes in the markets in which we operate, or changes in management strategy. We test reporting units for impairment by comparing the\nestimated fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount. We test brands for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of each brand with\nits carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit or brand exceeds its estimated fair value, we record an impairment loss based on the difference\nbetween fair value and carrying amount, in the case of reporting units, not to exceed the associated carrying amount of goodwill.\n28\n\n\nFair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions, estimates, and market factors. Estimating the\nfair value of individual reporting units and brands requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans, as well as industry, economic,\nand regulatory conditions. These assumptions and estimates include estimated future annual net cash flows, income tax considerations, discount rates, growth\nrates, royalty rates, contributory asset charges, and other market factors. If current expectations of future growth rates and margins are not met, if market\nfactors outside of our control, such as discount rates, change, or if management’s expectations or plans otherwise change, including as a result of updates to\nour global five-year operating plan, then one or more of our reporting units or brands might become impaired in the future. We are currently actively\nreviewing the enterprise strategy for the Company. As part of this strategic review, we expect to develop updates to the five-year operating plan in 2020,\nwhich could impact the allocation of investments among reporting units and brands and impact growth expectations and fair value estimates. Additionally, as\na result of this strategic review process, we could decide to divest certain non-strategic assets. As a result, the ongoing development of the enterprise strategy\nand underlying detailed business plans could lead to the impairment of one or more of our reporting units or brands in the future, or a decision to amortize\nindefinite-lived intangible assets over a defined period of time.\nAs detailed in Note 9, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, we record",

Such conditions could include significant adverse\nchanges in the business climate, current-period operating or cash flow losses, significant declines in forecasted operations, or a current expectation that an\nasset group will be disposed of before the end of its useful life. We perform undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists.\nWhen testing for impairment of definite-lived intangible assets held for use, we group assets at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately\nidentifiable. If an impairment is determined to exist, the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value. Impairment losses on definite-lived intangible assets\nto be disposed of, if any, are based on the estimated proceeds to be received, less costs of disposal.\nSee Note 9, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for our impairment testing results.\nPostemployment Benefit Plans:\nWe maintain various retirement plans for the majority of our employees. These include pension benefits, postretirement health care benefits, and defined\ncontribution benefits. The cost of these plans is charged to expense over an appropriate term based on, among other things, the cost component and whether\nthe plan is active or inactive. Changes in the fair value of our plan assets result in net actuarial gains or losses. These net actuarial gains and losses are\ndeferred into accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) and amortized within other expense/(income) in future periods using the corridor approach.\nThe corridor is 10% of the greater of the market-related value of the plan’s asset or projected benefit obligation. Any actuarial gains and losses in excess of\nthe corridor are then amortized over an appropriate term based on whether the plan is active or inactive.\nFor our postretirement benefit plans, our 2020 health care cost trend rate assumption will be 6.5%. We established this rate based upon our most recent\nexperience as well as our expectation for health care trend rates going forward. We anticipate the weighted average assumed ultimate trend rate will be 4.9%.\nThe year in which the ultimate trend rate is reached varies by plan, ranging between the years 2020 and 2030. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a\nsignificant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans. A one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have had the\nfollowing effects, increase/(decrease) in cost and obligation, as of December 28, 2019 (in millions):\n \nOne-Percentage-Point\n \nIncrease\n \n(Decrease)\nEffect on annual service and interest cost\n$\n3  $\n(2)",

An additional potential source of liquidity is access to capital markets. We\nintend to use our cash on hand for daily funding requirements and access to our Senior Credit Facility, if necessary.

Management believes that presenting our\nnon-GAAP financial measures (i.e., Organic Net Sales, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EPS) is useful to investors because it (i) provides investors with\nmeaningful supplemental information regarding financial performance by excluding certain items, (ii) permits investors to view performance using the same\ntools that management uses to budget, make operating and strategic decisions, and evaluate historical performance, and (iii) otherwise provides supplemental\ninformation that may be useful to investors in evaluating our results. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when\nconsidered together with the corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to those measures, provides investors with additional\nunderstanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent these disclosures.\nOrganic Net Sales is defined as net sales excluding, when they occur, the impact of currency, acquisitions and divestitures, and a 53rd week of shipments. We\ncalculate the impact of currency on net sales by holding exchange rates constant at the previous year’s exchange rate, with the exception of highly inflationary\nsubsidiaries, for which we calculate the previous year’s results using the current year’s exchange rate. Organic Net Sales is a tool that can assist management\nand investors in comparing our performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect\nour underlying operations.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income/(loss) from continuing operations before interest expense, other expense/(income), provision for/(benefit from)\nincome taxes, and depreciation and amortization (excluding integration and restructuring expenses); in addition to these adjustments, we exclude, when they\noccur, the impacts of integration and restructuring expenses, deal costs, unreal",

Adjusted EBITDA is a tool that can assist management and investors in comparing\nour performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our underlying operations.\nAdjusted EPS is defined as diluted earnings per share excluding, when they occur, the impacts of integration and restructuring expenses, deal costs, unrealized\nlosses/(gains) on commodity hedges, impairment losses, losses/(gains) on the sale of a business, other losses/(gains) related to acquisitions and divestitures\n(e.g., tax and hedging impacts), nonmonetary currency devaluation (e.g., remeasurement gains and losses), debt prepayment and extinguishment costs, and\nU.S. Tax Reform discrete income tax expense/(benefit), and including, when they occur, adjustments to reflect preferred stock dividend payments on an\naccrual basis.

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of\nDecember 28, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of\nthe Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of\nDecember 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 28,\n2019 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company did not maintain, in all\nmaterial respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated\nFramework (2013) issued by the COSO because material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting existed as of that date related to the risk\nassessment component of internal control, as the Company did not appropriately design controls in response to the risk of material misstatement due to\nchanges in their business environment. The risk assessment material weakness gave rise to an additional material weakness as the Company did not design\nand maintain effective controls over the accounting for supplier contracts and related arrangements.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility\nthat a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.

Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal\ncontrol over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial\nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,\nevidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.

Management conducts an impairment test annually as of the first day of the second\nquarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a brand is less than its carrying amount.\nManagement recognized non-cash impairment losses of $687 million in SG&A for the year ended December 28, 2019. Brands are tested for impairment by\ncomparing the estimated fair value of each brand with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a brand exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment\nloss is recorded based on the difference between the fair value and carrying amount. Management utilizes either an excess earnings method or relief from\nroyalty method to estimate the fair value of its brands. The determination of fair value using the excess earnings method requires the use of estimates and\nassumptions including the estimated future annual net cash flows for each brand (including net sales, cost of products sold, and SG&A), contributory asset\ncharges, income tax considerations, long-term growth rates, discount rates and other market factors.

(“Kraft”) with and into a\nwholly-owned subsidiary of H.J. Heinz Holding Corporation (“Heinz”) (the “2015 Merger”). At the closing of the 2015 Merger, Heinz was renamed The\nKraft Heinz Company (“Kraft Heinz”). Before the consummation of the 2015 Merger, Heinz was controlled by Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and 3G Global\nFood Holdings, L.P. (“3G Capital”), following their acquisition of H. J. Heinz Company on June 7, 2013.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include Kraft Heinz and all of our controlled subsidiaries.

Our remaining businesses are combined and disclosed as “Rest of World.” Rest of World comprises two\noperating segments: Latin America and Asia Pacific (“APAC”).\nDuring the third quarter of 2019, certain organizational changes were announced that will impact our future internal reporting and reportable segments. As a\nresult of these changes, we plan to combine our EMEA, Latin America, and APAC zones to form the International zone. The International zone will be a\nreportable segment along with the United States and Canada in 2020. We also plan to move our Puerto Rico business from the Latin America zone to the\nUnited States zone to consolidate and streamline the management of our product categories and supply chain. These changes will be effective in the first\nquarter of 2020.\nUse of Estimates\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S.\nGAAP”), which requires us to make accounting policy elections, estimates, and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, reserves, and\nexpenses. These policy elections, estimates, and assumptions are based on our best estimates and judgments. We evaluate our policy elections, estimates, and\nassumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment. We believe these estimates to be\nreasonable given the current facts available. We adjust our policy elections, estimates, and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate. Market\nvolatility, including foreign currency exchange rates, increases the uncertainty inherent in our estimates and assumptions. As future events and their effects\ncannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from estimates. If actual amounts differ from estimates, we include the revisions\nin our consolidated results of operations in the period the actual amounts become known. Historically, the aggregate differences, if any, between our estimates\nand actual amounts in any year have not had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nReclassifications\nWe made reclassifications to certain previously reported financial information to conform to our current period presentation.\nHeld for Sale\nAt December 29, 2018, we had classified certain assets and liabilities as held for sale in our consolidated balance sheet primarily relating to the previously\nannounced divestiture of our equity interests in a subsidiary in India and our divestiture of certain assets and operations in Canada, which closed in 2019.

Significant Accounting Policies\nRevenue Recognition:\nOur revenues are primarily derived from customer orders for the purchase of our products. We recognize revenues as performance obligations are fulfilled\nwhen control passes to our customers. We record revenues net of variable consideration, including consumer incentives and performance obligations related\nto trade promotions, excluding taxes, and including all shipping and handling charges billed to customers (accounting for shipping and handling charges that\noccur after the transfer of control as fulfillment costs). We also record a refund liability for estimated product returns and customer allowances as reductions\nto revenues within the same period that the revenue is recognized. We base these estimates principally on historical and current period experience factors. We\nrecognize costs paid to third party brokers to obtain contracts as expenses as our contracts are generally less than one year.\nAdvertising, Consumer Incentives, and Trade Promotions:\nWe promote our products with advertising, consumer incentives, and performance obligations related to trade promotions. Consumer incentives and trade\npromotions include, but are not limited to, discounts, coupons, rebates, performance-based in-store display activities, and volume-based incentives. Variable\nconsideration related to consumer incentive and trade promotion activities is recorded as a reduction to revenues based on amounts estimated as being due to\ncustomers and consumers at the end of a period. We base these estimates principally on historical utilization, redemption rates, and/or current period\nexperience factors. We review and adjust these estimates at least quarterly based on actual experience and other information.\nAdvertising expenses are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”). For interim reporting purposes, we charge advertising to\noperations as a percentage of estimated full year sales activity and marketing costs. We then review and adjust these estimates each quarter based on actual\nexperience and other information. We recorded advertising expenses of $534 million in 2019, $584 million in 2018, and $629 million in 2017, which\nrepresented costs to obtain physical advertisement spots in television, radio, print, digital, and social channels. We also incur other advertising and marketing\ncosts such as shopper marketing, sponsorships, and agency advertisement conception, design, and public relations fees. Total advertising and marketing costs\nwere $1.1 billion in 2019, 2018, and 2017.\nResearch and Development Expense:\nWe expense costs as incurred for product research and development within SG&A. Research and development expenses were approximately $112 million in\n2019, $109 million in 2018, and $93 million in 2017.\nStock-Based Compensation:\nWe recognize compensation costs re",

We classify\nequity award compensation costs primarily within general corporate expenses. See Note 11, Employees’ Stock Incentive Plans, for additional information.\nPostemployment Benefit Plans:\nWe maintain various retirement plans for the majority of our employees. These include pension benefits, postretirement health care benefits, and defined\ncontribution benefits. The cost of these plans is charged to expense over an appropriate term based on, among other things, the cost component and whether\nthe plan is active or inactive. Changes in the fair value of our plan assets result in net actuarial gains or losses. These net actuarial gains and losses are\ndeferred into accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) and amortized within other expense/(income) in future periods using the corridor approach.\nThe corridor is 10% of the greater of the market-related value of the plan’s asset or projected benefit obligation. Any actuarial gains and losses in excess of\nthe corridor are then amortized over an appropriate term based on whether the plan is active or inactive. See Note 12, Postemployment Benefits, for additional\ninformation.\nIncome Taxes:\nWe recognize income taxes based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and record deferred tax assets or liabilities for any difference\nbetween the financial reporting and tax basis of our assets and liabilities. We also recognize deferred tax assets for temporary differences, operating loss\ncarryforwards, and tax credit carryforwards. Inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans, planning opportunities, and\nexpectations about future outcomes. Realization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily net operating loss and other carryforwards, is dependent upon\ngenerating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods.\nWe apply a more-likely-than-not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions. Accordingly, we recognize the amount of tax\nbenefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement.\n51\n\n\nFuture changes in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect our results in the quarter of such change.\nWe record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.

The resolution of tax reserves and changes in\nvaluation allowances could be material to our results of operations for any period, but is not expected to be material to our financial position.\nCommon Stock and Preferred Stock Dividends:\nDividends are recorded as a reduction to retained earnings. When we have an accumulated deficit, dividends are recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in\ncapital.\nCash and Cash Equivalents:\nCash equivalents include demand deposits with banks and all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. Cash and cash\nequivalents that are legally restricted as to withdrawal or usage is classified in other current assets or other non-current assets, as applicable, on the\nconsolidated balance sheets.\nInventories:\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We value inventories primarily using the average cost method.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment:\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost and depreciated on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Machinery\nand equipment are depreciated over periods ranging from three years to 20 years and buildings and improvements over periods up to 40 years. Capitalized\nsoftware costs are included in property, plant and equipment and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the software, which do\nnot exceed seven years.

Such conditions could include significant adverse changes in the business climate, current-period operating or cash flow losses, significant\ndeclines in forecasted operations, or a current expectation that an asset group will be disposed of before the end of its useful life.

Our lease\nterms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option.\nWe do not record lease contracts with a term of 12 months or less on our consolidated balance sheets.\nWe recognize fixed lease expense for operating leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For finance leases, we recognize amortization expense on\nthe ROU asset and interest expense on the lease liability over the lease term.\nWe have lease agreements with non-lease components that relate to the lease components (e.g., common area maintenance such as cleaning or landscaping,\ninsurance, etc.). We account for each lease and any non-lease components associated with that lease as a single lease component for all underlying asset\nclasses. Accordingly, all costs associated with a lease contract are accounted for as lease costs.\nCertain leasing arrangements require variable payments that are dependent on usage or output or may vary for other reasons, such as insurance and tax\npayments. Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or rate are excluded from lease payments in the measurement of the ROU asset and lease\nliability and are recognized as expense in the period in which the payment occurs.\nOur lease agreements do not include significant restrictions or covenants, and residual value guarantees are generally not included within our operating leases.\nFinancial Instruments:\nAs we source our commodities on global markets and periodically enter into financing or other arrangements abroad, we use a variety of risk management\nstrategies and financial instruments to manage commodity price, foreign currency exchange rate, and interest rate risks. Our risk management program\nfocuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our\noperating results. One way we do this is through actively hedging our risks through the use of derivative instruments. As a matter of policy, we do not use\nhighly leveraged derivative instruments, nor do we use financial instruments for speculative purposes.\nDerivatives are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as assets or liabilities at fair value, which fluctuates based on changing market conditions.\nCertain derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges and qualify for hedge accounting treatment, while others are not designated as hedging instruments and\nare marked to ma",

The most significant impact of\nadoption on our consolidated financial statements was the recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities for operating leases. Our accounting for finance\nleases remained substantially unchanged. Upon adoption, we had total lease assets of $821 million and total lease liabilities of $887 million. The adoption of\nthis ASU did not result in a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings/(deficit) and did not impact our consolidated statements\nof income or our cash flows. See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, for our lease accounting policy and Note 19, Leases, for additional information\nrelated to our lease arrangements.\nReclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income:\nIn February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02 related to reclassifying tax effects stranded in accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) because of\nthe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“U.S. Tax Reform”) enacted on December 22, 2017. U.S. Tax Reform reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35.0% to\n21.0%. ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, requires the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of such changes in tax laws or rates to be\npresented in net income/(loss) from continuing operations. However, the related tax effects of such deferred tax assets and liabilities may have been originally\nrecorded in other comprehensive income/(loss). This ASU allows companies to reclassify such stranded tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive\nincome/(losses) to retained earnings/(deficit). This reclassification adjustment is optional, and if elected, may be applied either to the period of adoption or\nretrospectively to the period(s) impacted by U.S. Tax Reform.

This ASU applies to\nfinancial assets measured at amortized cost, including loans, held-to-maturity debt securities, net investments in leases, and trade accounts receivable as well\nas certain off-balance sheet credit exposures, such as loan commitments. This ASU replaces the current incurred loss impairment methodology with a\nmethodology to reflect CECL and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to explain credit loss estimates.

We do not expect this guidance to have a significant impact on\nour financial statements and related disclosures.\nFair Value Measurement Disclosures:\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13 related to fair value measurement disclosures. This ASU removes the requirement to disclose the amount of\nand reasons for transfers between Levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the policy for determining that a transfer has occurred, and valuation processes\nfor Level 3 fair value measurements. Additionally, this ASU modifies the disclosures related to the measurement uncertainty for recurring Level 3 fair value\nmeasurements (by removing the requirement to disclose sensitivity to future changes) and the timing of liquidation of investee assets (by removing the timing\nrequirement in certain instances). The guidance also requires new disclosures for Level 3 financial assets and liabilities, including the amount and location of\nunrealized gains and losses recognized in other comprehensive income/(loss) and additional information related to significant unobservable inputs used in\ndetermining Level 3 fair value measurements.

The guidance requires sponsors of these plans to provide additional disclosures, including weighted-average interest rates used in\nthe company’s cash balance plans and a narrative description of reasons for any significant gains or losses impacting the benefit obligation for the period.\nAdditionally, this guidance eliminates certain previous disclosure requirements. This ASU will be effective beginning with our Annual Report on Form 10-K\nfor the year ended December 26, 2020. This guidance must be applied on a retrospective basis to all periods presented.\nImplementation Costs Incurred in Hosted Cloud Computing Service Arrangements:\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15 related to accounting for implementation costs incurred in hosted cloud computing service arrangements.\nUnder the new guidance, implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract should be expensed or capitalized based on the\nnature of the costs and the project stage during which such costs are incurred. If the implementation costs qualify for capitalization, they must be amortized\nover the term of the hosting arrangement and assessed for impairment. Companies must disclose the nature of any hosted cloud computing service\narrangements. This ASU also provides guidance for balance sheet and income statement presentation of capitalized implementation costs and statement of\ncash flows presentation for the related payments. This ASU will be effective beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2020. This guidance may be\nadopted either retrospectively or prospectively to all implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption. We will prospectively adopt this guidance and\ndo not expect that it will have a significant impact on our financial statements and related disclosures.\nSimplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes:\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12 to simplify the accounting in ASC 740, Income Taxes. This guidance removes certain exceptions related to\nthe approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period, and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities\nfor outside basis differences.

The Primal Kitchen brand holds leading positions in the e-commerce and natural channels. The results of Primal Nutrition have been included in\nour consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 28, 2019.

We recognized these deal costs primarily in\nSG&A. We did not incur any deal costs in 2017.\n58\n\n\nDivestitures\nPotential Disposition:\nAs of December 28, 2019, we were in negotiations with a prospective buyer for 100% of the equity interests in a subsidiary within our Rest of World segment\nfor cash of approximately $55 million. This subsidiary generated approximately $1 million of net income in 2019. The aggregate carrying value of net assets\nto be transferred and accumulated foreign currency losses to be released is expected to be approximately $126 million. As a result, we recorded a loss of\napproximately $71 million in 2019 related to this transaction. This loss was included in other expense/(income). In addition, we have classified the related\nassets and liabilities as held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet at December 28, 2019. We expect this transaction to close in the first half of 2020.\nHeinz India Transaction:\nIn October 2018, we entered into a definitive agreement with two third-parties, Zydus Wellness Limited and Cadila Healthcare Limited (collectively, the\n“Buyers”), to sell 100% of our equity interests in Heinz India Private Limited (“Heinz India”) for approximately 46 billion Indian rupees (approximately $655\nmillion at January 30, 2019) (the “Heinz India Transaction”).

We recorded tax indemnity liabilities\nrelated to the Heinz India Transaction totaling approximately $48 million, including $18 million in other current liabilities and $30 million in other non-\ncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of the Heinz India Closing Date. We also recorded a corresponding $48 million reduction of the gain on\nthe Heinz India Transaction within other expense/(income) in our consolidated statement of income in the first quarter of 2019.

The factors that\nled to this conclusion included: (i) changes in management structure which triggered the reorganization of the EMEA East and Latin America Exports\nreporting units in the first quarter; (ii) new management in certain of these reporting units coupled with the development of our five-year operating plan\nassumptions for each of these reporting units in the first quarter, which established revised expectations and priorities for the coming years in response to\ncurrent market factors, such as lower revenue growth and margin expectations; (iii) increases in discount rates used to value reporting units in these regions\ndue to expectations of increased risk in these emerging markets; and (iv) fluctuations in forecasted foreign exchange rates in certain countries.\nWe recognized a non-cash impairment loss of $620 million in SG&A in the first quarter of 2019 related to the three reporting units noted above that are\ncontained within our EMEA and Rest of World segments. We determined the factors contributing to the impairment loss were the result of circumstances that\narose during the first quarter of 2019.\nWe recognized a $286 million impairment loss in our EMEA East reporting unit within our EMEA segment. In the first quarter of 2019, we reorganized our\nreporting units to combine Russia, Poland, Middle East, and Distributors operations into the EMEA East reporting unit as a result of changing our\nmanagement structure.

While the corporate tax rate reduction was effective January 1, 2018, we\naccounted for this anticipated rate change in 2017, the period of enactment.\nStaff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) in December 2017 provided us with up to one year to\nfinalize accounting for the impacts of U.S. Tax Reform and allowed for provisional estimates when actual amounts could not be determined. As of December\n30, 2017, we had made estimates of our deferred income tax benefit related to the corporate rate change, the toll charge, certain components of the revaluation\nof deferred tax assets and liabilities, including depreciation and executive compensation, and a change in our indefinite reinvestment assertion. In connection\nwith U.S. Tax Reform, we reassessed our international investment assertion and no longer consider the historic earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of\nDecember 30, 2017 to be indefinitely reinvested.

Additionally, we elected to account for the tax on GILTI as a period cost and thus did not adjust any of the deferred tax assets and liabilities of our\nforeign subsidiaries for U.S. Tax Reform.\nAs of December 29, 2018, we had finalized our accounting for U.S. Tax Reform. The final impact (the majority of which was recorded in 2017, the period of\nenactment) was a net tax benefit of approximately $7.1 billion, including a deferred tax benefit of approximately $7.5 billion related to the corporate rate\nchange, partially offset by tax expense of $224 million related to the toll charge and $120 million for other tax expenses, including the deferred tax liability\nrecorded for changing our indefinite reinvestment assertion.\nAs of December 28, 2019, we have recorded a deferred tax liability of $20 million on approximately $300 million of historic earnings related to local\nwithholding taxes that will be owed when this cash is distributed. As of December 29, 2018, we had recorded a deferred tax liability of $78 million on $1.2\nbillion of historic earnings. The decreases in our deferred tax liability and historic earnings are primarily due to repatriation. Related to these distributions, we\nreduced our historic earnings by approximately $700 million and recorded tax expenses of approximately $40 million and reduced the deferred tax liability\naccordingly. Additionally, we reduced our historic earnings by approximately $110 million following the ratification of the U.S. tax treaty with Spain which\neliminated withholding tax on Spanish distributions and resulted in a tax benefit of approximately $11 million and a corresponding decrease in our deferred\ntax liability. Finally, we reduced our historic earnings by approximately $30 million related to a held for sale business in our Rest of World segment, which\nresulted in a tax benefit of approximately $6 million.\nSubsequent to January 1, 2018, we consider the unremitted earnings of certain international subsidiaries that impose local country taxes on dividends to be\nindefinitely reinvested. For those undistributed earnings considered to be indefinitely reinvested, our intent is to reinvest these funds in our international\noperations, and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate the accumulated earnings to fund our U.S. cash requirements. The amount of\nunrecognized deferred tax liabilities for local country withholding taxes that would be owed related to our 2018 and 2019 earnings of certain international\nsubsidiaries is approximately $70 million.\n68\n\n\nProvision for/(Benefit from) Income Taxes:\nIncome/(loss) before income taxes and the provision for/(benefit from) income taxes, consisted of the following (in millions):\n \nDecember 28, 2019  December 29, 2018  December 30, 2017\nIncome/(loss) before income taxes:\n \n  \n  \nUnited States\n$\n796  $\n(10,305)  $\n3,811\nInternational\n1,865  \n(1,016)  \n1,639\nTotal\n",

Postemployment Benefits\nWe maintain various retirement plans for the majority of our employees. Current defined benefit pension plans are provided primarily for certain domestic\nunion and foreign employees. Local statutory requirements govern many of these plans. The pension benefits of our unionized workers are in accordance with\nthe applicable collective bargaining agreement covering their employment. Defined contribution plans are provided for certain domestic unionized, non-union\nhourly, and salaried employees as well as certain employees in foreign locations.\nWe provide health care and other postretirement benefits to certain of our eligible retired employees and their eligible dependents. Certain of our U.S. and\nCanadian employees may become eligible for such benefits. We may modify plan provisions or terminate plans at our discretion. The postretirement benefits\nof our unionized workers are in accordance with the applicable collective bargaining agreement covering their employment.\nWe remeasure our postemployment benefit plans at least annually.\nWe capitalize a portion of net pension and postretirement cost/(benefit) into inventory based on our production activities.

The investment strategy expects equity investments to yield a higher return over the long\nterm than fixed-income securities, while fixed-income securities are expected to provide certain matching characteristics to the plans’ benefit payment cash\nflow requirements. Our investment policy specifies the type of investment vehicles appropriate for the applicable plan, asset allocation guidelines, criteria for\nthe selection of investment managers, procedures to monitor overall investment performance as well as investment manager performance.

Venezuela - Foreign Currency and Inflation\nWe have a subsidiary in Venezuela that manufactures and sells a variety of products, primarily in the condiments and sauces and infant and nutrition\ncategories. We apply highly inflationary accounting to the results of our Venezuelan subsidiary and include these results in our consolidated financial\nstatements. Under highly inflationary accounting, the functional currency of our Venezuelan subsidiary is the U.S. dollar (the reporting currency of Kraft\nHeinz), although the majority of its transactions are in Venezuelan bolivars. As a result, we must revalue the results of our Venezuelan subsidiary to U.S.\ndollars.\n91\n\n\nAs of December 28, 2019, companies and individuals are allowed to use an auction-based system at private and public banks to obtain foreign currency. This\nis the only foreign currency exchange mechanism legally available to us for converting Venezuelan bolivars to U.S. dollars.

We believe the BCV Rate is the most appropriate legally available rate at which to translate the results of our Venezuelan subsidiary. Therefore,\nwe revalue the income statement using the weighted average BCV Rates, and we revalue the bolivar-denominated monetary assets and liabilities at the\nperiod-end BCV Rate. The resulting revaluation gains and losses are recorded in current net income/(loss), rather than accumulated other comprehensive\nincome/(losses). These gains and losses are classified within other expense/(income) as nonmonetary currency devaluation on our consolidated statements of\nincome.\nThe BCV Rate at December 28, 2019 was BsS45,874.81 per U.S. dollar compared to BsS638.18 at December 29, 2018. The weighted average rate was\nBsS13,955.68 for 2019, BsS25.06 for 2018, and BsS0.02 for 2017. Remeasurements of the bolivar-denominated monetary assets and liabilities and operating\nresults of our Venezuelan subsidiary at BCV Rates resulted in nonmonetary currency devaluation losses of $10 million in 2019, $146 million in 2018, and $36\nmillion in 2017. These losses were recorded in other expense/(income) in the consolidated statements of income.\nOur Venezuelan subsidiary obtains U.S. dollars through private and public bank auctions, royalty payments, and exports. These U.S. dollars are primarily\nused for purchases of tomato paste and spare parts for manufacturing, as well as a limited amount of other operating costs. As of December 28, 2019, our\nVenezuelan subsidiary had sufficient U.S. dollars to fund these operational needs in the foreseeable future. However, further deterioration of the economic\nenvironment or regulation changes could jeopardize our export business.\nIn addition to the bank auctions described above, there is an unofficial market for obtaining U.S. dollars with Venezuelan bolivars. The exact exchange rate is\nwidely debated but is generally accepted to be substantially higher than the latest published BCV Rate. We have not transacted at any unofficial market rates\nand have no plans to transact at unofficial market rates in the foreseeable future.\nOur results of operations in Venezuela reflect a controlled subsidiary. However, the continuing economic uncertainty, strict labor laws, and evolving\ngovernment controls over imports, prices, currency exchange, and payments present a challenging operating environment. Increased restrictions imposed by\nthe Venezuelan government along with further deterioration of the economic environment could impact our ability to control our Venezuelan operations and\ncould lead us to deconsolidate our Venezuelan subsidiary in the future.\nNote 16.

During 2018, we had Programs in place in various countries across the globe. In the second quarter of 2018, we unwound our U.S. securitization\nprogram, which represented the majority of our Programs, using proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt in June 2018. As of December 29, 2018, we\nhad unwound all of our Programs. As a result, there were no related amounts on our consolidated balance sheets at December 28, 2019 or December 29,\n2018.\nWe operated the Programs such that we generally utilized the majority of the available aggregate cash consideration limits. We accounted for transfers of\nreceivables pursuant to the Programs as a sale and removed them from our consolidated balance sheets. Under the Programs, we generally received cash\nconsideration up to a certain limit and recorded a non-cash exchange for sold receivables for the remainder of the purchase price. We maintained a “beneficial\ninterest,” or a right to collect cash, in the sold receivables.

Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial\nreporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control\nover financial reporting includes those written policies and procedures that:\n•\npertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets;\n•\nprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles;\n•\nprovide reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with management and director authorization; and\n•\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of assets that could have a\nmaterial effect on the consolidated financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance\nwith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an\nevaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2019 based on the framework described in Internal Control\n- Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this evaluation, our\nmanagement concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2019 due to the material weaknesses\ndescribed below.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that\na material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nAs previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 29, 2018, we identified a material weakness in the risk assessment\ncomponent of internal control as we did not appropriately design controls in response to the risk of misstatement due to changes in our business environment.\nThis material weakness in risk assessment gave rise to the specific control deficiency described below, which we also determined to be a material weakness,\nand both material weaknesses have not been remediated as of December 28, 2019:\n115",

Specifically, certain employees in our procurement organization engaged in misconduct and circumvented controls that\nincluded withholding information or directing others to withhold information related to supplier contracts that affected the accounting for certain\nsupplier rebates, incentives, and pricing arrangements, in an attempt to influence the achievement of internal financial targets that became or were\nperceived to have become increasingly difficult to attain due to changes in our business environment. Additionally, in certain instances, we did not\nhave a sufficient understanding or maintain sufficient documentation of the transaction to determine the appropriate accounting for certain cost and\nrebate elements and embedded leases. This material weakness resulted in misstatements that were corrected in the restatement included in our\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 29, 2018.\nAdditionally, the material weaknesses described above could result in a misstatement of substantially all account balances or disclosures that would result in a\nmaterial misstatement of the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected.\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm that audited the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K, has also audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2019, as stated in their report\nwhich appears herein under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nRemediation Efforts to Address Material Weaknesses\nOur management, with oversight from our Audit Committee, is in the process of executing a plan to remediate the material weaknesses described above. This\nplan includes the implementation of additional controls and procedures to strengthen our internal controls related to our risk assessment component of internal\ncontrol over financial reporting and supplier contracts and related arrangements. To date, the following actions have been taken towards our remediation plan:\n•\nPersonnel Actions—A comprehensive disciplinary plan has been implemented for all employees found to have engaged in misconduct, including\ntermination, written warnings, and appropriate training depending on the severity of the misconduct.\n•\nOrganizational Enhancements—We have implemented the following organizational enhancements: (i) augmented our procurement finance teams\nwith additional professionals with the appropriate levels of accounting and controls knowledge, experience, and training in the area of supplier\ncontracts and related arrangements; and (ii) realigned reporting lines whereby procurement finance now report directly to the finance organization.\n•\nProcurement Practices—We ",

We will also continue to review, optimize, and enhance our financial reporting controls and procedures.

Specifically, we did not design and maintain effective controls to reassess the level of precision used in the review of the allocation of\ncash flow projections to certain brands used as a basis for performing our fourth quarter 2018 interim impairment assessments in response to the significant\nreduction in, and in certain instances elimination of, the excess fair value over carrying amount of certain brands that resulted from changes in our business\nenvironment.\nDue to the actions taken by the Company to implement new controls and procedures, management has concluded that this material weakness has been\nremediated as of December 28, 2019. The actions we took to remediate this material weakness were as follows:\n•\nWe have enhanced the level of precision at which our internal controls over financial reporting relating to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible\nasset impairment assessments are performed. Specifically, we implemented and executed additional procedures to (i) enhance our analysis of\nforecasted cash flows used in the impairment assessment and (ii) test the accuracy of forecasted cash flow allocations to specific brands.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, with other members of management, evaluated the changes in our internal control over financial\nreporting during the three months ended December 28, 2019.

(“Berkshire Hathaway”) and 3G Global Food Holdings, L.P.\n(“3G Capital”) (together, the “Sponsors”), following their acquisition of H. J. Heinz Company on June 7, 2013.\nReportable Segments\nWe manage and report our operating results through four segments. We have three reportable segments defined by geographic region: United States, Canada,\nand Europe, Middle East, and Africa (“EMEA”). Our remaining businesses are combined and disclosed as “Rest of World.” Rest of World comprises two\noperating segments: Latin America and Asia Pacific (“APAC”).\nDuring the third quarter of 2019, certain organizational changes were announced that will impact our future internal reporting and reportable segments. As a\nresult of these changes, we plan to combine our EMEA, Latin America, and APAC zones to form the International zone. The International zone will be a\nreportable segment along with the United States and Canada in 2020. We also plan to move our Puerto Rico business from the Latin America zone to the\nUnited States zone to consolidate and streamline the management of our product categories and supply chain. These changes will be effective in the first\nquarter of 2020.\nSee Note 22, Segment Reporting, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for our geographic financial information by segment.\nTrademarks and Intellectual Property\nOur trademarks are material to our business and are among our most valuable assets. Depending on the country, trademarks generally remain valid for as long\nas they are in use or their registration status is maintained. Trademark registrations generally are for renewable, fixed terms. Significant trademarks by\nsegment based on net sales in 2019 were:\n \n \nMajority Owned and Licensed Trademarks\nUnited States\n Kraft, Oscar Mayer, Heinz, Philadelphia, Lunchables, Velveeta, Planters, Maxwell House, Capri Sun*, Kool-Aid, Ore-Ida, Jell-O\nCanada\n Kraft, Heinz, Philadelphia, Maxwell House, Classico, McCafe*, Tassimo*\nEMEA\n Heinz, Plasmon, Pudliszki, Honig, HP, Benedicta, Kraft, Karvan Cevitam\nRest of World\n Heinz, ABC, Master, Kraft, Quero, Golden Circle, Wattie's\n*Used under license.

We source these commodities from a variety of providers, including large, international producers\nand smaller, local, independent sellers. Where appropriate, we seek to establish preferred purchaser status and have developed strategic partnerships with\nmany of our suppliers with the objective of achieving favorable pricing and dependable supply for many of our commodities.

Risk Factors.\nIndustry Risks\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry.\nThe food and beverage industry is highly competitive across all of our product offerings. Our principal competitors in these categories are manufacturers, as\nwell as retailers with their own branded and private label products. We compete based on product innovation, price, product quality, nutritional value, service,\ntaste, convenience, brand recognition and loyalty, effectiveness of marketing and distribution, promotional activity, and the ability to identify and satisfy\nchanging consumer preferences.\nWe may need to reduce our prices in response to competitive and customer pressures, including pressures in relation to private label products that are\ngenerally sold at lower prices. These pressures have restricted and may in the future continue to restrict our ability to increase prices in response to\ncommodity and other cost increases. Failure to effectively assess, timely change and set proper pricing, promotions, or trade incentives may negatively impact\nthe achievement of our objectives.\n5\n\n\nThe rapid emergence of new distribution channels, particularly e-commerce, may create consumer price deflation, affecting our retail customer relationships\nand presenting additional challenges to increasing prices in response to commodity or other cost increases. We may also need to increase or reallocate\nspending on marketing, retail trade incentives, materials, advertising, and new product or channel innovation to maintain or increase market share. These\nexpenditures are subject to risks, including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance of our efforts. If we are unable to compete effectively, our\nprofitability, financial condition, and operating results may decline.\nOur success depends on our ability to correctly predict, identify, and interpret changes in consumer preferences and demand, to offer new products to\nmeet those changes, and to respond to competitive innovation.\nConsumer preferences for food and beverage products change continually and rapidly. Our success depends on our ability to predict, identify, and interpret the\ntastes and dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to consumer preferences, including with respect to health and wellness. If we do not\noffer products that appeal to consumers, our sales and market share will decrease, which could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial\ncondition, and operating results.\nWe must distinguish between short-term trends and long-term changes in consumer preferences.

In addition, because\nof our varied consumer base, we must offer an array of products that satisfy a broad spectrum of consumer preferences. If we fail to expand our product\nofferings successfully across product categories, or if we do not rapidly develop products in faster-growing or more profitable categories, demand for our\nproducts could decrease, which could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results.\nProlonged negative perceptions concerning the health implications of certain food and beverage products (including as they relate to obesity or other health\nconcerns) could influence consumer preferences and acceptance of some of our products and marketing programs. We strive to respond to consumer\npreferences and social expectations, but we may not be successful in our efforts. Continued negative perceptions and failure to satisfy consumer preferences\ncould materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results.\nIn addition, achieving growth depends on our successful development, introduction, and marketing of innovative new products and line extensions. There are\ninherent risks associated with new product or packaging introductions, including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance or potential impacts on\nour existing product offerings.

Additionally, we may be unable to\nmaintain favorable arrangements with respect to the costs of procuring raw materials, packaging, services, and transporting products, which could result in\nincreased expenses and negatively affect our operations. Furthermore, the cost of raw materials and finished products may fluctuate due to movements in\ncross-currency transaction rates. Rising commodity, energy, and other input costs could materially and adversely affect our cost of operations, including the\nmanufacture, transportation, and distribution of our products, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nAlthough we monitor our exposure to commodity prices as an integral part of our overall risk management program, and seek to hedge against input price\nincreases to the extent we deem appropriate, we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices, and our hedging strategies may not protect us from\nincreases in specific raw materials costs. For example, hedging our costs for one of our key commodities, dairy products, is difficult because dairy futures\nmarkets are not as developed as many other commodities futures markets. Continued volatility or sustained increases in the prices of commodities and other\nsupplies we purchase could increase the costs of our products, and our profitability could suffer. Moreover, increases in the prices of our products to cover\nthese increased costs may result in lower sales volumes, or we may be constrained from increasing the prices of our products by competitive and consumer\npressures. If we are not successful in our hedging activities, or if we are unable to price our products to cover increased costs, then commodity and other input\nprice volatility or increases could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nVolatility in the market value of all or a portion of the derivatives we use to manage exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices may cause volatility in\nour gross profit and net income.\nWe use commodity futures, options, and swaps to economically hedge the price of certain input costs, including dairy products, meat products, coffee beans,\nsugar, vegetable oils, wheat products, corn products, cocoa products, packaging products, diesel fuel, and natural gas.

This\nchange was driven by the operating income/(loss) factors described above (primarily lower impairment losses in 2019 compared to 2018) and favorable\nimpacts in other expense/(income), partially offset by a higher effective tax rate and higher interest expense, detailed as follows.\n•\nOther expense/(income) was $952 million of income in 2019 compared to $168 million of income in 2018. This increase was primarily driven by a\n$420 million net gain on sales of businesses in 2019 compared to a $15 million loss on sale of our South Africa subsidiary in 2018, a $162 million\nnon-cash settlement charge in the prior year related to the wind-up of our Canadian salaried and Canadian hourly defined benefit pension plans, and\na $136 million decrease in nonmonetary currency devaluation losses related to our Venezuelan operations as compared to the prior year period. The\n$420 million net gain on sales of businesses in 2019 consisted of a $249 million gain on the sale of Heinz India Private Limited (“Heinz India”)\n(“Heinz India Transaction”), a $242 million gain on the sale of certain assets in our natural cheese business in Canada (“Canada Natural Cheese\nTransaction”), and a $71 million loss on an anticipated sale of a subsidiary within our Rest of World segment.\n•\nThe effective tax rate was 27.4% in 2019 on pre-tax income compared to 9.4% in 2018 on a pre-tax loss. The 2019 effective tax rate was higher\nprimarily driven by lower non-deductible goodwill impairments, partially offset by a more favorable geographic mix of pre-tax income in various\nnon-U.S. jurisdictions and a decrease in unfavorable rate reconciling items. Current year unfavorable impacts primarily related to non-deductible\ngoodwill impairments, the impact of the federal tax on global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”), an increase in uncertain tax position reserves,\nthe establishment of certain state valuation allowance reserves, and the tax impacts from the Heinz India and Canada Natural Cheese Transactions.\nThese impacts were partially offset by the reversal of certain withholding tax obligations and changes in estimates of certain 2018 U.S. income and\ndeductions.\n23\n\n\n•\nInterest expense was $1.4 billion in 2019 compared to $1.3 billion in 2018. This increase was primarily driven by a $98 million loss on\nextinguishment of debt recognized in connection with our debt tender offers and redemptions completed in 2019. Excluding the impact of the loss on\nextinguishment of debt, interest expense was generally flat as compared to the prior year period.\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased 13.7% to $6.1 billion in 2019 compared to $7.0 billion in 2018.

We record revenues net of variable consideration, including consumer incentives and performance obligations related\nto trade promotions, excluding taxes, and including all shipping and handling charges billed to customers (accounting for shipping and handling charges that\noccur after the transfer of control as fulfillment costs). We also record a refund liability for estimated product returns and customer allowances as reductions\nto revenues within the same period that the revenue is recognized. We base these estimates principally on historical and current period experience factors. We\nrecognize costs paid to third party brokers to obtain contracts as expenses as our contracts are generally less than one year.\nAdvertising, Consumer Incentives, and Trade Promotions:\nWe promote our products with advertising, consumer incentives, and performance obligations related to trade promotions. Consumer incentives and trade\npromotions include, but are not limited to, discounts, coupons, rebates, performance-based in-store display activities, and volume-based incentives. Variable\nconsideration related to consumer incentive and trade promotion activities is recorded as a reduction to revenues based on amounts estimated as being due to\ncustomers and consumers at the end of a period. We base these estimates principally on historical utilization, redemption rates, and/or current period\nexperience factors. We review and adjust these estimates at least quarterly based on actual experience and other information.\nAdvertising expenses are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”). For interim reporting purposes, we charge advertising to\noperations as a percentage of estimated full year sales activity and marketing costs. We then review and adjust these estimates each quarter based on actual\nexperience and other information. We recorded advertising expenses of $534 million in 2019, $584 million in 2018, and $629 million in 2017, which\nrepresented costs to obtain physical advertisement spots in television, radio, print, digital, and social channels. We also incur other advertising and marketing\ncosts such as shopper marketing, sponsorships, and agency advertisement conception, design, and public relations fees.

We test brands for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of each brand with\nits carrying amount.

We review definite-lived intangible assets for\nimpairment when conditions exist that indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Such conditions could include significant adverse\nchanges in the business climate, current-period operating or cash flow losses, significant declines in forecasted operations, or a current expectation that an\nasset group will be disposed of before the end of its useful life. We perform undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists.\nWhen testing for impairment of definite-lived intangible assets held for use, we group assets at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately\nidentifiable. If an impairment is determined to exist, the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value. Impairment losses on definite-lived intangible assets\nto be disposed of, if any, are based on the estimated proceeds to be received, less costs of disposal.\nSee Note 9, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for our impairment testing results.\nPostemployment Benefit Plans:\nWe maintain various retirement plans for the majority of our employees. These include pension benefits, postretirement health care benefits, and defined\ncontribution benefits. The cost of these plans is charged to expense over an appropriate term based on, among other things, the cost component and whether\nthe plan is active or inactive. Changes in the fair value of our plan assets result in net actuarial gains or losses. These net actuarial gains and losses are\ndeferred into accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) and amortized within other expense/(income) in future periods using the corridor approach.\nThe corridor is 10% of the greater of the market-related value of the plan’s asset or projected benefit obligation. Any actuarial gains and losses in excess of\nthe corridor are then amortized over an appropriate term based on whether the plan is active or inactive.\nFor our postretirement benefit plans, our 2020 health care cost trend rate assumption will be 6.5%. We established this rate based upon our most recent\nexperience as well as our expectation for health care trend rates going forward. We anticipate the weighted average assumed ultimate trend rate will be 4.9%.\nThe year in which the ultimate trend rate is reached varies by plan, ranging between the years 2020 and 2030. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a\nsignificant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans. A one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have had the\nfollowing effects, increase/(decrease) in cost and obligation, as of December 28, 2019 (in millions):\n \nOne-Percentage-Point\n \nIncrease\n \n(Decrease)\nEffect on annual service and interest cost\n$\n3  $\n(2)",

Other purchase obligations include commitments for marketing, advertising, capital expenditures, information technology, and professional services.

Certain purchase obligations contain variable pricing components, and, as a result, actual cash\npayments are expected to fluctuate based on changes in these variable components. Due to the proprietary nature of some of our materials and processes, certain supply contracts contain penalty\nprovisions for early terminations. We do not believe that a material amount of penalties is reasonably likely to be incurred under these contracts based upon historical experience and current\nexpectations.

Management believes that presenting our\nnon-GAAP financial measures (i.e., Organic Net Sales, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EPS) is useful to investors because it (i) provides investors with\nmeaningful supplemental information regarding financial performance by excluding certain items, (ii) permits investors to view performance using the same\ntools that management uses to budget, make operating and strategic decisions, and evaluate historical performance, and (iii) otherwise provides supplemental\ninformation that may be useful to investors in evaluating our results.

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of\nDecember 28, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of\nthe Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of\nDecember 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 28,\n2019 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company did not maintain, in all\nmaterial respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated\nFramework (2013) issued by the COSO because material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting existed as of that date related to the risk\nassessment component of internal control, as the Company did not appropriately design controls in response to the risk of material misstatement due to\nchanges in their business environment. The risk assessment material weakness gave rise to an additional material weakness as the Company did not design\nand maintain effective controls over the accounting for supplier contracts and related arrangements.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility\nthat a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weaknesses\nreferred to above are described in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. We considered these material\nweaknesses in determining",

Our responsibility is to\nexpress opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We\nare a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent\nwith respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange\nCommission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal\ncontrol over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial\nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,\nevidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used\nand significant estimates made by\n42\n\n\nmanagement, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting\nincluded obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating\nthe design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we\nconsidered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting",

A company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect\nthe transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being\nmade only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or\ntimely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance\nwith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were\ncommunicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated\nfinancial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.

Basis of Presentation\nOrganization\nOn July 2, 2015 (the “2015 Merger Date”) through a series of transactions, we consummated the merger of Kraft Foods Group, Inc. (“Kraft”) with and into a\nwholly-owned subsidiary of H.J. Heinz Holding Corporation (“Heinz”) (the “2015 Merger”). At the closing of the 2015 Merger, Heinz was renamed The\nKraft Heinz Company (“Kraft Heinz”). Before the consummation of the 2015 Merger, Heinz was controlled by Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and 3G Global\nFood Holdings, L.P. (“3G Capital”), following their acquisition of H. J. Heinz Company on June 7, 2013.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include Kraft Heinz and all of our controlled subsidiaries.

Our remaining businesses are combined and disclosed as “Rest of World.” Rest of World comprises two\noperating segments: Latin America and Asia Pacific (“APAC”).\nDuring the third quarter of 2019, certain organizational changes were announced that will impact our future internal reporting and reportable segments. As a\nresult of these changes, we plan to combine our EMEA, Latin America, and APAC zones to form the International zone. The International zone will be a\nreportable segment along with the United States and Canada in 2020. We also plan to move our Puerto Rico business from the Latin America zone to the\nUnited States zone to consolidate and streamline the management of our product categories and supply chain. These changes will be effective in the first\nquarter of 2020.\nUse of Estimates\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S.\nGAAP”), which requires us to make accounting policy elections, estimates, and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, reserves, and\nexpenses. These policy elections, estimates, and assumptions are based on our best estimates and judgments. We evaluate our policy elections, estimates, and\nassumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment. We believe these estimates to be\nreasonable given the current facts available. We adjust our policy elections, estimates, and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate. Market\nvolatility, including foreign currency exchange rates, increases the uncertainty inherent in our estimates and assumptions. As future events and their effects\ncannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from estimates. If actual amounts differ from estimates, we include the revisions\nin our consolidated results of operations in the period the actual amounts become known. Historically, the aggregate differences, if any, between our estimates\nand actual amounts in any year have not had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nReclassifications\nWe made reclassifications to certain previously reported financial information to conform to our current period presentation.\nHeld for Sale\nAt December 29, 2018, we had classified certain assets and liabilities as held for sale in our consolidated balance sheet primarily relating to the previously\nannounced divestiture of our equity interests in a subsidiary in India and our divestiture of certain assets and operations in Canada, which closed in 2019. At\nDecember 28, 2019, the assets and liabilities identified as held for sale in our consolidated balance sheet primarily relate to a business in our Rest of World\nsegment, as well as certain other assets that are",

Significant Accounting Policies\nRevenue Recognition:\nOur revenues are primarily derived from customer orders for the purchase of our products. We recognize revenues as performance obligations are fulfilled\nwhen control passes to our customers. We record revenues net of variable consideration, including consumer incentives and performance obligations related\nto trade promotions, excluding taxes, and including all shipping and handling charges billed to customers (accounting for shipping and handling charges that\noccur after the transfer of control as fulfillment costs). We also record a refund liability for estimated product returns and customer allowances as reductions\nto revenues within the same period that the revenue is recognized. We base these estimates principally on historical and current period experience factors. We\nrecognize costs paid to third party brokers to obtain contracts as expenses as our contracts are generally less than one year.\nAdvertising, Consumer Incentives, and Trade Promotions:\nWe promote our products with advertising, consumer incentives, and performance obligations related to trade promotions. Consumer incentives and trade\npromotions include, but are not limited to, discounts, coupons, rebates, performance-based in-store display activities, and volume-based incentives. Variable\nconsideration related to consumer incentive and trade promotion activities is recorded as a reduction to revenues based on amounts estimated as being due to\ncustomers and consumers at the end of a period. We base these estimates principally on historical utilization, redemption rates, and/or current period\nexperience factors. We review and adjust these estimates at least quarterly based on actual experience and other information.\nAdvertising expenses are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”). For interim reporting purposes, we charge advertising to\noperations as a percentage of estimated full year sales activity and marketing costs. We then review and adjust these estimates each quarter based on actual\nexperience and other information. We recorded advertising expenses of $534 million in 2019, $584 million in 2018, and $629 million in 2017, which\nrepresented costs to obtain physical advertisement spots in television, radio, print, digital, and social channels. We also incur other advertising and marketing\ncosts such as shopper marketing, sponsorships, and agency advertisement conception, design, and public relations fees. Total advertising and marketing costs\nwere $1.1 billion in 2019, 2018, and 2017.\nResearch and Development Expense:\nWe expense costs as incurred for product research and development within SG&A. Research and development expenses were approximately $112 million in\n2019, $109 million in 2018, and $93 million in 2017.\nStock-Based Compensation:\nWe recognize compensation costs re",

These costs are primarily recognized within\nSG&A. We estimate expected forfeitures rather than recognizing forfeitures as they occur in determining our equity award compensation costs. We classify\nequity award compensation costs primarily within general corporate expenses. See Note 11, Employees’ Stock Incentive Plans, for additional information.\nPostemployment Benefit Plans:\nWe maintain various retirement plans for the majority of our employees. These include pension benefits, postretirement health care benefits, and defined\ncontribution benefits. The cost of these plans is charged to expense over an appropriate term based on, among other things, the cost component and whether\nthe plan is active or inactive. Changes in the fair value of our plan assets result in net actuarial gains or losses. These net actuarial gains and losses are\ndeferred into accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) and amortized within other expense/(income) in future periods using the corridor approach.\nThe corridor is 10% of the greater of the market-related value of the plan’s asset or projected benefit obligation. Any actuarial gains and losses in excess of\nthe corridor are then amortized over an appropriate term based on whether the plan is active or inactive. See Note 12, Postemployment Benefits, for additional\ninformation.\nIncome Taxes:\nWe recognize income taxes based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and record deferred tax assets or liabilities for any difference\nbetween the financial reporting and tax basis of our assets and liabilities. We also recognize deferred tax assets for temporary differences, operating loss\ncarryforwards, and tax credit carryforwards. Inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans, planning opportunities, and\nexpectations about future outcomes. Realization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily net operating loss and other carryforwards, is dependent upon\ngenerating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods.\nWe apply a more-likely-than-not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions. Accordingly, we recognize the amount of tax\nbenefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement.\n51\n\n\nFuture changes in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect our results in the quarter of such change.\nWe record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.

Should a change in circumstances lead to a change in\njudgment about the realizability of deferred tax assets in future years, we would adjust related valuation allowances in the period that the change in\ncircumstances occurs, along with a corresponding adjustment to our provision for/(benefit from) income taxes. The resolution of tax reserves and changes in\nvaluation allowances could be material to our results of operations for any period, but is not expected to be material to our financial position.\nCommon Stock and Preferred Stock Dividends:\nDividends are recorded as a reduction to retained earnings. When we have an accumulated deficit, dividends are recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in\ncapital.\nCash and Cash Equivalents:\nCash equivalents include demand deposits with banks and all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. Cash and cash\nequivalents that are legally restricted as to withdrawal or usage is classified in other current assets or other non-current assets, as applicable, on the\nconsolidated balance sheets.\nInventories:\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We value inventories primarily using the average cost method.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment:\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost and depreciated on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Machinery\nand equipment are depreciated over periods ranging from three years to 20 years and buildings and improvements over periods up to 40 years. Capitalized\nsoftware costs are included in property, plant and equipment and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the software, which do\nnot exceed seven years. We review long-lived assets for impairment when conditions exist that indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully\nrecoverable. Such conditions could include significant adverse changes in the business climate, current-period operating or cash flow losses, significant\ndeclines in forecasted operations, or a current expectation that an asset group will be disposed of before the end of its useful life. We perform undiscounted\noperating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists. When testing for impairment of assets held for use, we group assets at the lowest level for\nwhich cash flows are separately identifiable. If an impairment is determined to exist, the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value. Impairment losses on\nassets to be disposed of, if any, are based on the estimated proceeds to be received, less costs of disposal.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets:\nWe maintain 19 reporting units, 11 of which comprise our goodwill balance.

We test reporting units for impairment\nby comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount. We test brands for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of\neach brand with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit or brand exceeds its estimated fair value, we record an impairment loss based\non the difference between fair value and carrying amount, in the case of reporting units, not to exceed the associated carrying amount of goodwill.\nDefinite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated periods benefited. We review definite-lived intangible assets for\nimpairment when conditions exist that indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Such conditions could include significant adverse\nchanges in the business climate, current-period operating or cash flow losses, significant declines in forecasted operations, or a current expectation that an\nasset group will be disposed of before the end of its useful life.

Lease liabilities are recognized at lease commencement date based on the\npresent value of remaining lease payments over the lease term. As the discount rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable in most of our leases, we\nuse our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. Our lease\nterms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option.\nWe do not record lease contracts with a term of 12 months or less on our consolidated balance sheets.\nWe recognize fixed lease expense for operating leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For finance leases, we recognize amortization expense on\nthe ROU asset and interest expense on the lease liability over the lease term.\nWe have lease agreements with non-lease components that relate to the lease components (e.g., common area maintenance such as cleaning or landscaping,\ninsurance, etc.). We account for each lease and any non-lease components associated with that lease as a single lease component for all underlying asset\nclasses. Accordingly, all costs associated with a lease contract are accounted for as lease costs.\nCertain leasing arrangements require variable payments that are dependent on usage or output or may vary for other reasons, such as insurance and tax\npayments. Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or rate are excluded from lease payments in the measurement of the ROU asset and lease\nliability and are recognized as expense in the period in which the payment occurs.\nOur lease agreements do not include significant restrictions or covenants, and residual value guarantees are generally not included within our operating leases.\nFinancial Instruments:\nAs we source our commodities on global markets and periodically enter into financing or other arrangements abroad, we use a variety of risk management\nstrategies and financial instruments to manage commodity price, foreign currency exchange rate, and interest rate risks. Our risk management program\nfocuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our\noperating results. One way we do this is through actively hedging our risks through the use of derivative instruments. As a matter of policy, we do not use\nhighly leveraged derivative instruments, nor do we use financial instruments for speculative purposes.\nDerivatives are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as assets or liabilities at fair value, which fluctuates based on changing market conditions.\nCertain derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges and qualify for hedge accounting treatment, while others are not designated as hedging instruments and\nare marked to ma",

The excluded component on derivatives designated\nas net investment hedges is recognized in net income/(loss) within interest expense. The income statement classification of gains and losses related to\nderivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments is determined based on the underlying intent of the contracts. Cash flows related to the\nsettlement of derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges of foreign operations are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows\nwithin investing activities. All other cash flows related to derivative instruments are classified in the same line item as the cash flows of the related hedged\nitem, which is generally within operating activities.\n53\n\n\nTo qualify for hedge accounting, a specified level of hedging effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the item being hedged must be achieved at\ninception and maintained throughout the hedged period. When a hedging instrument no longer meets the specified level of hedging effectiveness, we\nreclassify the related hedge gains or losses previously deferred into other comprehensive income/(losses) to net income/(loss) within other expense/(income).\nWe formally document our risk management objectives, our strategies for undertaking the various hedge transactions, the nature of and relationships between\nthe hedging instruments and hedged items, and the method for assessing hedge effectiveness. Additionally, for qualified hedges of forecasted transactions, we\nspecifically identify the significant characteristics and expected terms of the forecasted transactions. If it becomes probable that a forecasted transaction will\nnot occur, the hedge will no longer be effective and all of the derivative gains or losses would be recognized in net income/(loss) in the curr",

Under highly\ninflationary accounting, the financial statements of a subsidiary are remeasured into our reporting currency (U.S. dollars) based on the legally available\nexchange rate at which we expect to settle the underlying transactions.

We apply highly\ninflationary accounting to the results of our subsidiaries in Venezuela and Argentina. The net monetary assets of our subsidiary in Argentina were\napproximately $1 million at December 28, 2019.

The updated guidance requires lessees to reflect the majority of leases on their balance sheets as assets and obligations. This ASU became\neffective beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2019.

The most significant impact of\nadoption on our consolidated financial statements was the recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities for operating leases. Our accounting for finance\nleases remained substantially unchanged. Upon adoption, we had total lease assets of $821 million and total lease liabilities of $887 million. The adoption of\nthis ASU did not result in a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings/(deficit) and did not impact our consolidated statements\nof income or our cash flows. See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, for our lease accounting policy and Note 19, Leases, for additional information\nrelated to our lease arrangements.\nReclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income:\nIn February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02 related to reclassifying tax effects stranded in accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) because of\nthe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“U.S. Tax Reform”) enacted on December 22, 2017. U.S. Tax Reform reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35.0% to\n21.0%. ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, requires the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of such changes in tax laws or rates to be\npresented in net income/(loss) from continuing operations. However, the related tax effects of such deferred tax assets and liabilities may have been originally\nrecorded in other comprehensive income/(loss). This ASU allows companies to reclassify such stranded tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive\nincome/(losses) to retained earnings/(deficit). This reclassification adjustment is optional, and if elected, may be applied either to the period of adoption or\nretrospectively to the period(s) impacted by U.S. Tax Reform. Additionally, this ASU requires companies to disclose the policy election for stranded tax\neffects as well as the general accounting policy for releasing income tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses).

We generally release income tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) when the entire portfolio of the item giving rise to\nthe tax effect is disposed of, liquidated, or terminated.\n55\n\n\nAccounting Standards Not Yet Adopted\nMeasurement of Current Expected Credit Losses:\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13 to update the methodology used to measure current expected credit losses (“CECL”). This ASU applies to\nfinancial assets measured at amortized cost, including loans, held-to-maturity debt securities, net investments in leases, and trade accounts receivable as well\nas certain off-balance sheet credit exposures, such as loan commitments. This ASU replaces the current incurred loss impairment methodology with a\nmethodology to reflect CECL and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to explain credit loss estimates. The\nguidance must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition method through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings/(deficit) in the period\nof adoption. This ASU will be effective beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2020. We do not expect this guidance to have a significant impact on\nour financial statements and related disclosures.\nFair Value Measurement Disclosures:\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13 related to fair value measurement disclosures. This ASU removes the requirement to disclose the amount of\nand reasons for transfers between Levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the policy for determining that a transfer has occurred, and valuation processes\nfor Level 3 fair value measurements. Additionally, this ASU modifies the disclosures related to the measurement uncertainty for recurring Level 3 fair value\nmeasurements (by removing the requirement to disclose sensitivity to future changes) and the timing of liquidation of investee assets (by removing the timing\nrequirement in certain instances). The guidance also requires new disclosures for Level 3 financial assets and liabilities, including the amount and location of\nunrealized gains and losses recognized in other comprehensive income/(loss) and additional information related to significant unobservable inputs used in\ndetermining Level 3 fair value measurements. This ASU will be effective beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2020. Early adoption of the guidance\nin whole is permitted.

There was no other impact to our\nfinancial statement disclosures as a result of early adopting the provisions related to removing disclosures.\nDisclosure Requirements for Certain Employer-Sponsored Benefit Plans:\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-14 related to the disclosure requirements for employers that sponsor defined benefit pension and other\npostretirement benefit plans. The guidance requires sponsors of these plans to provide additional disclosures, including weighted-average interest rates used in\nthe company’s cash balance plans and a narrative description of reasons for any significant gains or losses impacting the benefit obligation for the period.\nAdditionally, this guidance eliminates certain previous disclosure requirements. This ASU will be effective beginning with our Annual Report on Form 10-K\nfor the year ended December 26, 2020.

The increase in the discount rate was applied to reflect a market participants’ perceived risk in the valuation implied by the sustained reduction in\nour stock price and, hence, market capitalization (which decreased approximately 25% from December 29, 2018 to the March 31, 2019 annual impairment\ntest date and sustained this decline through June 29, 2019).\nFor Miracle Whip and Maxwell House, the reduction in fair value was also driven by lower expectations of near and long-term net sales growth that were\nadjusted in the second quarter of 2019 due to anticipated trends in consumer preferences. For Lunchables, the reduction in fair value was also due to lower\nforecasted net sales and royalty rate assumptions associated with lower profit margin expectations driven by pricing actions at certain customers. For Velveeta,\nPhiladelphia, and Cool Whip, no assumption changes other than the discount rate had a meaningful impact on the estimated fair value of brands. Since these\nvaluation assumption changes were made in connection with the annual impairment test in the second quarter of 2019 and were not indicative of events or\nconditions that would have constituted a triggering event during the first quarter of 2019, we recorded the non-cash impairment loss in the second quarter of\n2019. These brands had an aggregate carrying value of $13.5 billion prior to this impairment and $13.0 billion after impairment.\nThe aggregate carrying amount associated with an additional three brands (Kraft, Planters, and ABC), which each had excess fair value over its carrying\namount of 10% or less, was $13.4 billion as of the annual impairment test date. The aggregate carrying amount of an additional three brands (Oscar Mayer,\nJet Puffed, and Quero), which each had fair value over its carrying amount of between 10-20%, was $3.6 billion as of the annual impairment test date. The\naggregate carrying amount of brands with fair value over carrying amount between 20-50% was $4.2 billion, and the aggregate carrying amount of brands\nwith fair value over carrying amount in excess of 50% was $9.3 billion as of the annual impairment test date.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, in connection with the preparation of our year-end financial statements, we determined that it was more likely than not that the\nfair values of two of our brands, Maxwell House and Wattie’s, were below their carrying amounts. The factors that led us to the determination to test for\nimpairment were the same fourth quarter considerations outlined in the goodwill impairment discussion above.

The reduction in fair value of the Maxwell House trademark was driven by expectations of near-term net sales and profitability declines outlined in\nthe 2020 annual operating plan in response to consumer shifts from mainstream coffee brands to premium coffee brands. These shifts in expectations were\npartially offset by declines in market driven discount rates observed in the fourth quarter of 2019. Should market interest rates increase in future periods, the\nlikelihood for further impairment will increase. We determined the factors contributing to the impairment loss were the result of circumstances that arose\nduring the fourth quarter of 2019. This brand had a carrying value of approximately $823 million after the recorded impairment.\nThe Wattie’s brand was determined to not be impaired. The carrying amount of the Wattie’s brand is approximately $94 million and the fair value is between\n10-20% over the carrying amount.\n66\n\n\nAs a result of our 2018 annual impairment test, we recognized a non-cash impairment loss of $101 million in SG&A in the second quarter of 2018. This\nimpairment loss was due to net sales and margin declines related to the Quero brand in Brazil. The impairment loss was recorded in our Rest of World\nsegment, consistent with the ownership of the trademark.\nIn the third quarter of 2018, we recognized a non-cash impairment loss of $215 million in SG&A related to the Smart Ones brand. This impairment loss was\nprimarily due to reduced future investment expectations and continued sales declines in the third quarter of 2018.

Income Taxes\nU.S. Tax Reform:\nOn December 22, 2017, U.S. Tax Reform legislation was enacted by the federal government. The legislation significantly changed U.S. tax laws by, among\nother things, lowering the federal corporate tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0%, effective January 1, 2018 and imposing a one-time toll charge on deemed\nrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of December 30, 2017. In addition, there were many new provisions, including changes to bonus depreciation,\nrevised deductions for executive compensation and interest expense, a tax on global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”), the base erosion anti-abuse tax\n(“BEAT”), and a deduction for foreign-derived intangible income (“FDII”). While the corporate tax rate reduction was effective January 1, 2018, we\naccounted for this anticipated rate change in 2017, the period of enactment.\nStaff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) in December 2017 provided us with up to one year to\nfinalize accounting for the impacts of U.S. Tax Reform and allowed for provisional estimates when actual amounts could not be determined. As of December\n30, 2017, we had made estimates of our deferred income tax benefit related to the corporate rate change, the toll charge, certain components of the revaluation\nof deferred tax assets and liabilities, including depreciation and executive compensation, and a change in our indefinite reinvestment assertion.

The final impact (the majority of which was recorded in 2017, the period of\nenactment) was a net tax benefit of approximately $7.1 billion, including a deferred tax benefit of approximately $7.5 billion related to the corporate rate\nchange, partially offset by tax expense of $224 million related to the toll charge and $120 million for other tax expenses, including the deferred tax liability\nrecorded for changing our indefinite reinvestment assertion.\nAs of December 28, 2019, we have recorded a deferred tax liability of $20 million on approximately $300 million of historic earnings related to local\nwithholding taxes that will be owed when this cash is distributed. As of December 29, 2018, we had recorded a deferred tax liability of $78 million on $1.2\nbillion of historic earnings. The decreases in our deferred tax liability and historic earnings are primarily due to repatriation. Related to these distributions, we\nreduced our historic earnings by approximately $700 million and recorded tax expenses of approximately $40 million and reduced the deferred tax liability\naccordingly. Additionally, we reduced our historic earnings by approximately $110 million following the ratification of the U.S. tax treaty with Spain which\neliminated withholding tax on Spanish distributions and resulted in a tax benefit of approximately $11 million and a corresponding decrease in our deferred\ntax liability.

Our unrecognized tax benefits decreased during 2018 mainly as a result of audit settlements with federal, state, and\nforeign taxing authorities and statute of limitations expirations.\nWe include interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in our tax provision. Our provision for/(benefit from) income taxes included a $5 million\nexpense in 2018 and a $24 million benefit in 2017 related to interest and penalties.

Employees’ Stock Incentive Plans\nWe grant equity awards, including stock options, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), and performance share units (“PSUs”), to select employees to provide long-\nterm performance incentives to our employees.\nStock Plans\nWe had activity related to equity awards from the following plans in 2019, 2018, and 2017:\n2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan:\nIn April 2016, our Board of Directors approved the 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan (“2016 Omnibus Plan”), which authorized grants of options, stock\nappreciation rights, RSUs, deferred stock, performance awards, investment rights, other stock-based awards, and cash-based awards. This plan authorizes the\nissuance of up to 18 million shares of our common stock. Equity awards granted under the 2016 Omnibus Plan prior to 2019 generally have a five-year cliff\nvest period. Equity awards granted under the 2016 Omnibus Plan in 2019 include three-year and five-year cliff vest periods as well as awards that become\nexercisable in annual installments over three to four years beginning on the second anniversary of the original grant date. Non-qualified stock options have a\nmaximum exercise term of 10 years. Equity awards granted under the 2016 Omnibus Plan since inception include non-qualified stock options, RSUs, and\nPSUs.\n2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan:\nPrior to approval of the 2016 Omnibus Plan, we issued non-qualified stock options to select employees under the 2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan (“2013\nOmnibus Plan”). As a result of the 2015 Merger, each outstanding Heinz stock option was converted into 0.443332 of a Kraft Heinz stock option. Following\nthis conversion, the 2013 Omnibus Plan authorized the issuance of up to 17,555,947 shares of our common stock. Non-qualified stock options awarded under\nthe 2013 Omnibus Plan have a five-year cliff vest period and a maximum exercise term of 10 years. These non-qualified stock options will continue to vest\nand become exercisable in accordance with the terms and conditions of the 2013 Omnibus Plan and the relevant award agreements.\n71\n\n\nKraft 2012 Performance Incentive Plan:\nPrior to the 2015 Merger, Kraft issued equity-based awards, including stock options and RSUs, under its 2012 Performance Incentive Plan. As a result of the\n2015 Merger, each outstanding Kraft stock option was converted into an option to purchase a number of shares of our common stock based upon an option\nadjustment ratio, and each outstanding Kraft RSU was converted into one Kraft Heinz RSU. These Kraft Heinz equity awards will continue to vest and\nbecome exercisable in accordance with the terms and conditions that were applicable immediately prior to the completion of the 2015 Merger.

In accordance with the terms of the 2012 Performance Incentive Plan,\nvesting generally accelerates for holders of Kraft awards who are terminated without cause within 2 years of the 2015 Merger Date.\nIn addition, prior to the 2015 Merger, Kraft issued performance-based, long-term incentive awards (“Performance Shares”), which vested based on varying\nperformance, market, and service conditions. In connection with the 2015 Merger, all outstanding Performance Shares were converted into cash awards,\npayable in two installments: (i) a 2015 pro-rata payment based upon the portion of the Performance Share cycle completed prior to the 2015 Merger and (ii)\nthe remaining value of the award to be paid on the earlier of the first anniversary of the closing of the 2015 Merger and a participant's termination without\ncause.\nStock Options\nWe use the Black-Scholes model to estimate the fair value of stock option grants.

The expected life is the period over which our employees are expected to hold their options. Due to the lack of historical data, we calculated\nexpected life using the weighted average vesting period and the contractual term of the options. In 2019 and 2018, we estimated volatility using a blended\nvolatility approach of term-matched historical volatility from our daily stock prices and weighted average implied volatility. In 2017, we estimated volatility\nusing a blended approach of implied volatility and peer volatility. We calculated peer volatility as the average of the term-matched, leverage-adjusted\nhistorical volatilities of Colgate-Palmolive Co., The Coca-Cola Company, Mondelēz International, Altria Group, Inc., PepsiCo, Inc., and Unilever plc.

Our investment objectives include: investing plan assets in a high-quality, diversified manner in order to maintain the security\nof the funds; achieving an optimal return on plan assets within specified risk tolerances; and investing according to local regulations and requirements\nspecific to each country in which a defined benefit plan operates. The investment strategy expects equity investments to yield a higher return over the long\nterm than fixed-income securities, while fixed-income securities are expected to provide certain matching characteristics to the plans’ benefit payment cash\nflow requirements. Our investment policy specifies the type of investment vehicles appropriate for the applicable plan, asset allocation guidelines, criteria for\nthe selection of investment managers, procedures to monitor overall investment performance as well as investment manager performance.

Venezuela - Foreign Currency and Inflation\nWe have a subsidiary in Venezuela that manufactures and sells a variety of products, primarily in the condiments and sauces and infant and nutrition\ncategories. We apply highly inflationary accounting to the results of our Venezuelan subsidiary and include these results in our consolidated financial\nstatements. Under highly inflationary accounting, the functional currency of our Venezuelan subsidiary is the U.S. dollar (the reporting currency of Kraft\nHeinz), although the majority of its transactions are in Venezuelan bolivars. As a result, we must revalue the results of our Venezuelan subsidiary to U.S.\ndollars.\n91\n\n\nAs of December 28, 2019, companies and individuals are allowed to use an auction-based system at private and public banks to obtain foreign currency. This\nis the only foreign currency exchange mechanism legally available to us for converting Venezuelan bolivars to U.S. dollars. Published daily by the Banco\nCentral de Venezuela, the exchange rate (“BCV Rate”) is calculated as the weighted average rate of participating banking institu",

We believe the BCV Rate is the most appropriate legally available rate at which to translate the results of our Venezuelan subsidiary. Therefore,\nwe revalue the income statement using the weighted average BCV Rates, and we revalue the bolivar-denominated monetary assets and liabilities at the\nperiod-end BCV Rate. The resulting revaluation gains and losses are recorded in current net income/(loss), rather than accumulated other comprehensive\nincome/(losses). These gains and losses are classified within other expense/(income) as nonmonetary currency devaluation on our consolidated statements of\nincome.\nThe BCV Rate at December 28, 2019 was BsS45,874.81 per U.S. dollar compared to BsS638.18 at December 29, 2018. The weighted average rate was\nBsS13,955.68 for 2019, BsS25.06 for 2018, and BsS0.02 for 2017. Remeasurements of the bolivar-denominated monetary assets and liabilities and operating\nresults of our Venezuelan subsidiary at BCV Rates resulted in nonmonetary currency devaluation losses of $10 million in 2019, $146 million in 2018, and $36\nmillion in 2017. These losses were recorded in other expense/(income) in the consolidated statements of income.\nOur Venezuelan subsidiary obtains U.S. dollars through private and public bank auctions, royalty payments, and exports. These U.S. dollars are primarily\nused for purchases of tomato paste and spare parts for manufacturing, as well as a limited amount of other operating costs. As of December 28, 2019, our\nVenezuelan subsidiary had sufficient U.S. dollars to fund these operational needs in the foreseeable future. However, further deterioration of the economic\nenvironment or regulation changes could jeopardize our export business.\nIn addition to the bank auctions described above, there is an unofficial market for obtaining U.S. dollars with Venezuelan bolivars. The exact exchange rate is\nwidely debated but is generally accepted to be substantially higher than the latest published BCV Rate. We have not transacted at any unofficial market rates\nand have no plans to transact at unofficial market rates in the foreseeable future.\nOur results of operations in Venezuela reflect a controlled subsidiary. However, the continuing economic uncertainty, strict labor laws, and evolving\ngovernment controls over imports, prices, currency exchange, and payments present a challenging operating environment. Increased restrictions imposed by\nthe Venezuelan government along with further deterioration of the economic environment could impact our ability to control our Venezuelan operations and\ncould lead us to deconsolidate our Venezuelan subsidiary in the future.\nNote 16.

Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial\nreporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control\nover financial reporting includes those written policies and procedures that:\n•\npertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets;\n•\nprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles;\n•\nprovide reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with management and director authorization; and\n•\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of assets that could have a\nmaterial effect on the consolidated financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance\nwith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an\nevaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2019 based on the framework described in Internal Control\n- Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this evaluation, our\nmanagement concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2019 due to the material weaknesses\ndescribed below.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that\na material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nAs previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 29, 2018, we identified a material weakness in the risk assessment\ncomponent of internal control as we did not appropriately design controls in response to the risk of misstatement due to changes in our business environment.\nThis material weakness in risk assessment gave rise to the specific control deficiency described below, which we also determined to be a material weakness,\nand both material weaknesses have not been remediated as of December 28, 2019:\n115",

Specifically, certain employees in our procurement organization engaged in misconduct and circumvented controls that\nincluded withholding information or directing others to withhold information related to supplier contracts that affected the accounting for certain\nsupplier rebates, incentives, and pricing arrangements, in an attempt to influence the achievement of internal financial targets that became or were\nperceived to have become increasingly difficult to attain due to changes in our business environment. Additionally, in certain instances, we did not\nhave a sufficient understanding or maintain sufficient documentation of the transaction to determine the appropriate accounting for certain cost and\nrebate elements and embedded leases. This material weakness resulted in misstatements that were corrected in the restatement included in our\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 29, 2018.\nAdditionally, the material weaknesses described above could result in a misstatement of substantially all account balances or disclosures that would result in a\nmaterial misstatement of the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected.\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm that audited the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K, has also audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2019, as stated in their report\nwhich appears herein under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nRemediation Efforts to Address Material Weaknesses\nOur management, with oversight from our Audit Committee, is in the process of executing a plan to remediate the material weaknesses described above. This\nplan includes the implementation of additional controls and procedures to strengthen our internal controls related to our risk assessment component of internal\ncontrol over financial reporting and supplier contracts and related arrangements. To date, the following actions have been taken towards our remediation plan:\n•\nPersonnel Actions—A comprehensive disciplinary plan has been implemented for all employees found to have engaged in misconduct, including\ntermination, written warnings, and appropriate training depending on the severity of the misconduct.\n•\nOrganizational Enhancements—We have implemented the following organizational enhancements: (i) augmented our procurement finance teams\nwith additional professionals with the appropriate levels of accounting and controls knowledge, experience, and training in the area of supplier\ncontracts and related arrangements; and (ii) realigned reporting lines whereby procurement finance now report directly to the finance organization.\n•\nProcurement Practices—We ",

We will also continue to review, optimize, and enhance our financial reporting controls and procedures.

Specifically, we did not design and maintain effective controls to reassess the level of precision used in the review of the allocation of\ncash flow projections to certain brands used as a basis for performing our fourth quarter 2018 interim impairment assessments in response to the significant\nreduction in, and in certain instances elimination of, the excess fair value over carrying amount of certain brands that resulted from changes in our business\nenvironment.\nDue to the actions taken by the Company to implement new controls and procedures, management has concluded that this material weakness has been\nremediated as of December 28, 2019. The actions we took to remediate this material weakness were as follows:\n•\nWe have enhanced the level of precision at which our internal controls over financial reporting relating to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible\nasset impairment assessments are performed. Specifically, we implemented and executed additional procedures to (i) enhance our analysis of\nforecasted cash flows used in the impairment assessment and (ii) test the accuracy of forecasted cash flow allocations to specific brands.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, with other members of management, evaluated the changes in our internal control over financial\nreporting during the three months ended December 28, 2019.

      "output": "We have gathered several pieces of information from the junior workers regarding Kraft Heinz's FY2019 COGS and inventory values for FY2018 and FY2019. Here's a breakdown of the findings:\n\n1. **COGS for FY2019**: The COGS for FY2019 is reported as $43 million. This figure is consistent across the outputs and does not have conflicting values.\n\n2. **Inventory Values**:\n   - For FY2018, the inventory value is consistently reported as $2,667 million. This value is supported by multiple citations from the balance sheet.\n   - For FY2019, the inventory value is consistently reported as $2,721 million, also supported by multiple citations from the balance sheet.\n\n3. **Sufficiency of Information**: \n   - We have the necessary COGS for FY2019.\n   - We have the inventory values for both FY2018 and FY2019, which allows us to calculate the average inventory.\n\n4. **Calculation**:\n   - The average inventory between FY2018 and FY2019 is calculated as: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Average Inventory} = \\frac{2,667 + 2,721}{2} = 2,694 \\text{ million}\n     \\]\n   - The inventory turnover ratio is then calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{43}{2,694} \\approx 0.016\n     \\]\n   - Rounding to two decimal places, the inventory turnover ratio is 0.02.\n\n5. **Conflicting Answers**: There are no significant conflicts in the key figures needed for the calculation. The COGS and inventory values are consistent across the reliable citations.\n\nIn conclusion, we have sufficient and consistent information to calculate Kraft Heinz's FY2019 inventory turnover ratio, which is approximately 0.02."
