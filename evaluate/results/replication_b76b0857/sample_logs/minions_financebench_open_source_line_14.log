--- Question ---
Does Adobe have an improving operating margin profile as of FY2022? If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
Based on the available information, we cannot conclusively determine if Adobe has an improving operating margin profile as of FY2022. Additionally, there is no commentary in the document regarding the relevance of operating margin as a metric for Adobe.

--- Ground Truth ---
['No the operating margins of Adobe have recently declined from 36.8% in FY 2021 to 34.6% in FY2022. A drop by 2.2% in a year.']

--- Correctness Evaluation ---
Is correct: False
Confidence: 0.90
Reasoning: The predicted answer does not match the ground truth answer. The ground truth clearly states that Adobe's operating margin declined from 36.8% in FY2021 to 34.6% in FY2022, indicating a worsening margin profile. The predicted answer fails to acknowledge this decline and incorrectly states that the information is inconclusive.
