Answer in units of percents and round to one decimal place. Approach the question asked by assuming the standpoint of an investment banking analyst who only has access to the statement of income.\n\n---\n\nPlease provide succinct advice on the critical information we need to extract from the Financial document. Total length: 541469 characters to answer this question. \n\nAlso consider the following constraints:\n- In your response do NOT use numbered lists.\n- Do NOT structure your response as a sequence of steps.\n",
      "output": "To determine the FY2019 - FY2020 total revenue growth rate for Block (formerly known as Square), focus on extracting the total revenue figures for both fiscal years from the statement of income. These figures are typically found in the revenue section of the income statement, often labeled as \"Total Revenue\" or \"Net Revenue.\" Once you have these numbers, calculate the growth rate by finding the difference between the FY2020 and FY2019 revenues, dividing that difference by the FY2019 revenue, and then multiplying the result by 100 to convert it to a percentage. Ensure that the final growth rate is rounded to one decimal place. This approach will provide the necessary insight into the company's revenue performance over the specified period."

      "prompt": "# Decomposition Round #1\n\nYou (the supervisor) cannot directly read the document(s). Instead, you can assign small, isolated tasks to a less capable worker model that sees only a single chunk of text at a time. Any cross-chunk or multi-document reasoning must be handled by you.\n\n## Your Job: Write Two Python Functions\n\n### FUNCTION #1: `prepare_jobs(context, prev_job_manifests, prev_job_outputs) -> List[JobManifest]`\n- Break the document(s) into chunks (using the provided chunking function, if needed). Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 12 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`. All **multi-chunk integration** or **global reasoning** is your responsibility here.\n- Return one **aggregated string** suitable for further supervisor inspection.\n\n\n\n## Relevant Pydantic Models\n\nThe following models are already in the global scope. **Do NOT redefine or re-import them.**\n\n### JobManifest Model\n```\nclass JobManifest(BaseModel):\n    chunk: str  # the actual text for the chunk of the document\n    task: str  # the actual task instruction for the small model\n    advice: str  # optional, any additional advice on how to perform the task\n\n    chunk_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    task_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    job_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n\n```\n\n### JobOutput Model\n```\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    citation: Optional[str]\n    answer: Optional[str]\n\n```\n\n## Function Signatures\n```\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        context (List[str]): A list of documents.

The statements in this discussion regarding our\nexpectations of our future performance, liquidity, and capital resources; our plans, estimates, beliefs, and expectations that involve risks and uncertainties; and\nother  non-historical  statements  in  this  discussion  are  forward-looking  statements.  These  forward-looking  statements  are  subject  to  numerous  risks  and\nuncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described under “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our\nactual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nWe started Square in February 2009 to enable businesses (sellers) to accept card payments, an important capability that was previously inaccessible to\nmany businesses. However, sellers need many innovative solutions to thrive, and we have expanded to provide them additional products and services and to give\nthem access to a cohesive ecosystem of tools to help them manage and grow their businesses. Similarly, with Cash App, we have built a parallel ecosystem of\nfinancial services to help individuals manage their money.\nOur Seller ecosystem is a cohesive commerce ecosystem that helps sellers start, run and grow their businesses, and consists of over 30 distinct software,\nhardware, and financial services products. We monetize these products through a combination of transaction, subscription, and service fees. Our suite of cloud-\nbased software solutions are integrated to create a seamless experience and enable a holistic view of sales, customers, employees, and locations. With our offering,\na seller can accept payments in person via swipe, dip, or tap of a card or online via Square Invoices, Square Virtual Terminal, or the seller’s website. We also\nprovide  hardware  to  facilitate  commerce  for  sellers,  which  includes  magstripe  readers,  contactless  and  chip  readers,  Square  Stand,  Square  Register,  Square\nTerminal, and third-party peripherals. Square Card is a business prepaid card that enables sellers to spend the balance they have stored with Square. Sellers can also\ndeposit funds into their Square stored balance so they can manage all of their business expenses in one place. Sellers also gain access to business loans through\nSquare Capital based on the seller's payment processing history. We recognize revenue upon the sale of the loans to third-party investors or over time as the sellers\npay down the outstanding amounts for the loans that w",

These  forward-looking  statements  are  subject  to  numerous  risks  and\nuncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described under “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our\nactual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nWe started Square in February 2009 to enable businesses (sellers) to accept card payments, an important capability that was previously inaccessible to\nmany businesses. However, sellers need many innovative solutions to thrive, and we have expanded to provide them additional products and services and to give\nthem access to a cohesive ecosystem of tools to help them manage and grow their businesses. Similarly, with Cash App, we have built a parallel ecosystem of\nfinancial services to help individuals manage their money.\nOur Seller ecosystem is a cohesive commerce ecosystem that helps sellers start, run and grow their businesses, and consists of over 30 distinct software,\nhardware, and financial services products. We monetize these products through a combination of transaction, subscription, and service fees. Our suite of cloud-\nbased software solutions are integrated to create a seamless experience and enable a holistic view of sales, customers, employees, and locations. With our offering,\na seller can accept payments in person via swipe, dip, or tap of a card or online via Square Invoices, Square Virtual Terminal, or the seller’s website. We also\nprovide  hardware  to  facilitate  commerce  for  sellers,  which  includes  magstripe  readers,  contactless  and  chip  readers,  Square  Stand,  Square  Register,  Square\nTerminal, and third-party peripherals. Square Card is a business prepaid card that enables sellers to spend the balance they have stored with Square. Sellers can also\ndeposit funds into their Square stored balance so they can manage all of their business expenses in one place. Sellers also gain access to business loans through\nSquare Capital based on the seller's payment processing history. We recognize revenue upon the sale of the loans to third-party investors or over time as the sellers\npay down the outstanding amounts for the loans that w",

      "output": "### Analysis\n\n1. **Information Gathered**: \n   - The collected outputs indicate that the total revenue for FY2020 is $9,497,578,000. This figure is supported by multiple citations from the document excerpts.\n   - There is no clear information about the total revenue for FY2019 in the outputs provided. However, one output mentions a figure of $4,713,500,000 for FY2019, which seems to be the total revenue for that year.\n\n2. **Sufficiency of Information**:\n   - We have a clear figure for the total revenue for FY2020.\n   - We have a potential figure for FY2019, but it is not as well-supported by multiple outputs or citations as the FY2020 figure.\n\n3. **Missing Information**:\n   - A more reliable and well-cited figure for the total revenue for FY2019 is needed to confidently calculate the growth rate.\n\n4. **Calculation**:\n   - If we assume the FY2019 revenue is indeed $4,713,500,000, we can calculate the growth rate as follows:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Growth Rate} = \\left(\\frac{\\text{FY2020 Revenue} - \\text{FY2019 Revenue}}{\\text{FY2019 Revenue}}\\right) \\times 100\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\text{Growth Rate} = \\left(\\frac{9,497,578,000 - 4,713,500,000}{4,713,500,000}\\right) \\times 100 \\approx 101.4\\%\n     \\]\n\n5. **Conflicting Answers**:\n   - There are no conflicting figures for FY2020 revenue, but the FY2019 figure is less certain. The calculation above assumes the provided FY2019 figure is correct. If more reliable data for FY2019 is found, the calculation should be revisited.\n\nIn conclusion, assuming the FY2019 revenue figure is accurate, the total revenue growth rate from FY2019 to FY2020 for Block (formerly Square) is approximately 101.4%. However, further verification of the FY2019 revenue figure is recommended for accuracy."

What information we have gathered\n2. Whether it is sufficient to answer the question\n3. If not sufficient, what specific information is missing\n4. If sufficient, how we would calculate or derive the answer\n5. If there are conflicting answers:\n--> Use citations to select the correct answer if there are conflicting answers.\n\nBe brief and concise. No need for structured output - just think through the steps. You MUST respond in markdown format (for $ signs make sure to use escape character \\ before the $ sign).\n",
      "output": "### Analysis\n\n1. **Information Gathered:**\n   - The total revenue for FY2020 is consistently reported as \\$9,497,578,000 across multiple chunks, with citations from sections labeled \"Consolidated Statement of Operations Data\" and \"Total net revenue.\"\n   - The total revenue for FY2019 is reported as \\$4,713,500,000, also supported by multiple chunks with citations from similar sections.\n\n2. **Sufficiency of Information:**\n   - The information is sufficient to calculate the revenue growth rate between FY2019 and FY2020. Both revenue figures are consistently reported and cited from reliable sections of the financial documents.\n\n3. **Calculation of Growth Rate:**\n   - The revenue growth rate can be calculated using the formula:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Growth Rate} = \\left(\\frac{\\text{FY2020 Revenue} - \\text{FY2019 Revenue}}{\\text{FY2019 Revenue}}\\right) \\times 100\n     \\]\n   - Substituting the values:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Growth Rate} = \\left(\\frac{9,497,578,000 - 4,713,500,000}{4,713,500,000}\\right) \\times 100 \\approx 101.4\\%\n     \\]\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The calculated growth rate of 101.4% is consistent with the previous progress and is supported by the extracted data. The information is sufficient and reliable to answer the question regarding the revenue growth rate for Block (formerly known as Square) from FY2019 to FY2020."
