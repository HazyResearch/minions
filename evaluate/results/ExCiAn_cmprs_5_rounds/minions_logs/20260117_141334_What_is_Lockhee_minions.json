Provide a response to the question by primarily using the statement of income.\n\n---\n\nPlease provide succinct advice on the critical information we need to extract from the Financial document. Total length: 521944 characters to answer this question. \n\nAlso consider the following constraints:\n- In your response do NOT use numbered lists.\n- Do NOT structure your response as a sequence of steps.\n",
      "output": "To determine Lockheed Martin's 2-year total revenue CAGR from FY2020 to FY2022, focus on extracting the total revenue figures for FY2020 and FY2022 from the statement of income. The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) is calculated using the formula: \n\n\\[ \\text{CAGR} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Revenue in FY2022}}{\\text{Revenue in FY2020}} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}} - 1 \\]\n\nOnce you have the revenue figures for both years, apply them to the formula to find the CAGR. Ensure the revenue numbers are accurate and reflect the total revenue for each fiscal year. After calculating the CAGR, convert it to a percentage and round it to one decimal place for the final answer."

Instead, you can assign small, isolated tasks to a less capable worker model that sees only a single chunk of text at a time. Any cross-chunk or multi-document reasoning must be handled by you.\n\n## Your Job: Write Two Python Functions\n\n### FUNCTION #1: `prepare_jobs(context, prev_job_manifests, prev_job_outputs) -> List[JobManifest]`\n- Break the document(s) into chunks (using the provided chunking function, if needed). Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 12 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`. All **multi-chunk integration** or **global reasoning** is your responsibility here.\n- Return one **aggregated string** suitable for further supervisor inspection.\n\n\n\n## Relevant Pydantic Models\n\nThe following models are already in the global scope. **Do NOT redefine or re-import them.**\n\n### JobManifest Model\n```\nclass JobManifest(BaseModel):\n    chunk: str  # the actual text for the chunk of the document\n    task: str  # the actual task instruction for the small model\n    advice: str  # optional, any additional advice on how to perform the task\n\n    chunk_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    task_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    job_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n\n```\n\n### JobOutput Model\n```\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    citation: Optional[str]\n    answer: Optional[str]\n\n```\n\n## Function Signatures\n```\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        context (List[str]): A list of documents.

Finally, we are always in \npursuit of new program awards to develop future platforms that enable us to continue to place security capability into the \nmarket and expand our global reach.\nKey to enabling success of our strategy is developing differentiating technologies, forging strategic partnerships, including \nwith commercial companies, executing on our multi-year business transformation initiative to enhance our digital infrastructure \nand increase efficiencies and collaboration throughout our business and maintaining fiscal discipline. Underpinning our ability \nto execute our strategy is our talent and culture. We invest substantially in our people to ensure that our workforce has the \ntechnical skills necessary to succeed, and we expect to continue to invest internally in innovative technologies that address \nrapidly evolving mission requirements for our customers.

          "chunk": "regularly evolving.\nWe and others with which we do business must comply with laws and regulations relating to the award, administration and \nperformance of U.S. Government contracts. Government contract laws and regulations affect how we do business with our \ncustomers and impose certain risks and costs on our business. A violation of these laws and regulations by us, our employees, \nothers working on our behalf, a supplier or a joint venture partner could harm our reputation and result in the imposition of \nfines and penalties, the termination of our contracts, suspension or debarment from bidding on or being awarded contracts, loss \nof our ability to export products or perform services and civil or criminal investigations or proceedings. In addition, costs to \ncomply with new government regulations can increase our costs, reduce our margins and adversely affect our competitiveness. \nGovernment contract laws and regulations can impose terms or obligations that are different than those typically found in \ncommercial transactions. One of the significant differences is that the U.S. Government may terminate any of our government \ncontracts, not only for default based on our performance, but also at its convenience. Generally, prime contractors have a \nsimilar right under subcontracts related to government contracts. If a contract is terminated for convenience, we typically would \nbe entitled to receive payments for our allowable costs incurred and the proportionate share of fees or earnings for the work \nperformed. However, to the extent insufficient funds have been appropriated by the U.S. Government to the program to cover \nour costs upon a termination for convenience, the U.S. Government may assert that it is not required to appropriate additional \nfunding. If a contract is terminated for default, the U.S. Government could make claims to reduce the contract value or recover \nits procurement costs and could assess other special penalties, exposing us to liability and adversely affecting our ability to \ncompete for future contracts and orders. In addition, the U.S. Government could terminate a prime contract under which we are \na subcontractor, notwithstanding the fact that our performance and the quality of the products or services we delivered were \nconsistent with our contractual obligations as a subcontractor. Similarly, the U.S. Government could indirectly terminate a \nprogram or contract by not appropriating funding. The decision to terminate programs or contracts for convenience or default \ncould adversely affect our business and future financial performance.\nAnother significant difference from commercial contracting is the existence in government contracting of the concept of an \nundefinitized contract action (UCA), which is when we begin performing our obligations before the terms, specifications or \nTable of Contents \n11\n\n\nprice are finally agreed to between the parties.

This can affect our ability to negotiate mutually agreeable \ncontract terms. If a contract is unilaterally imposed upon us, it may negatively affect our expected profit and cash flows on a \nprogram or impose burdensome terms.\nIn addition to the unique risks associated with government contracts, the U.S. Government utilizes procurement policies \nthat could negatively impact our profitability or the ability to win new business. For example, the U.S. Government has \nprocurement policies that shift risk to contractors, such as using fixed-price contracts for development programs as described in \nthe following risk factor. Other changes in procurement policy that could affect the predictability of our profit rates or make it \nmore difficult to compete on certain types of programs include favoring more incentive-based fee arrangements, using different \naward fee criteria than historically used (such as the evaluation of environmental factors) or making government contract \nnegotiation offers based upon their view of what our costs should be (as compared to our actual costs). In addition, changes in \ncontract financing policy for fixed-price contracts, such as changes in performance and progress payments policies, could \nsignificantly affect the timing of our cash flows. From time to time, the U.S. Government has proposed contract terms, imposed \ninternal policies, or taken positions that represent fundamental changes from historical practices or that we believe are \ninconsistent with the FAR or other laws and regulations and that could adversely affect our business. Also, a portion of our \ncontracts are classified by the U.S. Government, which imposes security requirements that limit our ability to discuss our \nperformance on these contracts, including any specific risks, disputes and claims.\nAdditionally, the DoD is increasingly pursuing rapid acquisition pathways and procedures for new technologies, including \nthrough so called “other transaction authority” agreements (OTAs). OTAs are exempt from many traditional procurement laws, \nincluding the FAR, and an OTA award may be subject, in certain cases, to the condition that a significant portion of the work \nunder the OTA is performed by a non-traditional defense contractor or that a portion of the cost of the protype project is funded \nby non-governmental sources.

Failure to perform to customer expectations and contract requirements may result in reduced \nfees or losses and may adversely affect our financial performance. \nContract types primarily include fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts. Under each type of contract, if we are unable \nto control costs, our operating results could be adversely affected. Costs to complete a contract may increase for a variety of \nreasons, including technical and manufacturing challenges, schedule delays, workforce-related issues, or inaccurate initial \ncontract cost estimates. These could be caused by a variety of reasons, including labor shortages, the nature and complexity of \nthe work performed, the timeliness and availability of materials from suppliers, internal and subcontractor performance or \nproduct quality issues, inability to meet cost reduction initiatives or achieve efficiencies from digital transformation, changing \nlaws or regulations, inflation and natural disasters. Certain contracts may impose other risks, such as forfeiting fees, paying \npenalties, or providing replacement systems in the event of performance failure.\nCost-reimbursable contracts provide for the payment of allowable costs incurred during performance of the contract plus a \nfee up to a ceiling based on the amount that has been funded. Cost, schedule or technical performance issues with respect to \ncost-reimbursable contracts could result in reduced fees, lower profit rates, or program cancellation. \nFixed-price contracts are predominantly either firm fixed-price (FFP) contracts or fixed-price incentive (FPI) contracts. \nUnder FFP contracts, we receive a fixed price irrespective of the actual costs we incur and we therefore carry the burden of any \ncost overruns. Under FPI contracts, we generally share with the U.S. Government savings for cost underruns less than target \ncosts and expenses for cost overruns exceeding target costs up to a negotiated ceiling price. We carry the entire burden of cost \noverruns exceeding the ceiling price amount under FPI contracts. Due to the fixed-price nature of the contracts, if our actual \ncosts exceed our estimates, our margins and profits are reduced and we could incur a reach-forward loss. A reach-forward loss \nis when estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of the transaction price.

We expect we also will bid on similar \nTable of Contents \n12\n\n\nprograms in the future. Fixed-price development work or fixed price production options, especially on competitively bid \nprograms, is inherently riskier than cost-reimbursable work because the revenue is fixed, while the estimates of costs required \nto complete these contracts are subject to significant variability due to the complex and often experimental nature of \ndevelopment programs. The technical complexity coupled with the fixed-price contract structure of certain of our ongoing \ndevelopment programs or new programs increases the risk that our costs will be greater than anticipated, resulting in reduced \nmargins, operating profit, or reach-forward losses during the period of contract performance or upon contract award, all of \nwhich could be significant to our operating results, cash flows, or financial condition. In addition, we have certain contracts \nwhere we bid upfront on cost-reimbursable development work and the follow-on fixed-price production options in one \nsubmission.

FMS contracts with the U.S. Government are subject to the FAR \nand the DFARS. Because the U.S. Government functions as an intermediary in FMS sales, we are reliant on the capacity and \nspeed of the DoD’s administration of requests from non-U.S. countries to convert requests to sales. In contrast, DCS \ntransactions represent sales directly to international customers and are subject to U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, \nincluding import-export control, technology transfer restrictions, investments, taxation, repatriation of earnings, exchange \ncontrols, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws and regulations, and the anti-boycott provisions of \nthe U.S. Export Control Reform Act of 2018. While we have extensive policies in place to comply with such laws and \nregulations, failure by us, our employees or others working on our behalf to comply with these laws and regulations could result \nin administrative, civil, or criminal liabilities, including suspension, debarment from bidding for or performing government \ncontracts, or suspension of our export privileges, which could have a material adverse effect on us.

Among the variables management must assess in \nevaluating costs associated with these cases and remediation sites are the status of site assessment, extent of the contamination, \nimpacts on natural resources, changing cost estimates, evolution of technologies used to remediate the site, continually evolving \nenvironmental standards, availability of insurance coverage and indemnification under existing agreements and cost \nallowability issues, including varying efforts by the U.S. Government to limit allowability of our costs in resolving liability at \nthird-party-owned sites. Our environmental remediation related liabilities also could increase significantly because of \nacquisitions, the regulation of new substances, stricter remediation standards for existing regulated substances, changes in the \ninterpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations, or the discovery of previously unknown or more extensive \ncontamination or new contaminants. For information regarding these matters, including current estimates of the amounts that \nwe believe are required for environmental remediation to the extent probable and estimable, see “Critical Accounting Policies - \nEnvironmental Matters” in the MD&A and “Note 14 – Legal Proceedings, Commitments and Contingencies” included in our \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe manage and have managed various U.S. Government-owned facilities on behalf of the U.S. Government.

This \nincludes purchases pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 plans, including accelerated share repurchases. The program does not have an expiration \ndate.\n(c)\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2022, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreement to repurchase $4.0 billion of our \ncommon stock. Under the terms of the ASR agreement, we paid $4.0 billion and received an initial delivery of 6,995,147 shares of our \ncommon stock. We expect to receive additional shares upon final settlement, which is expected in March or April 2023. The total \nnumber of shares of common stock to be received under the ASR agreement will be based on an average volume-weighted average price \n(VWAP) of our common stock during the term of the ASR agreement, less a discount and subject to adjustments pursuant to the terms \nand conditions of the ASR agreement. Average Price Paid Per Share in the table above does not include ASR shares.\n(d)\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2022, the total number of shares purchased included 6,215 shares that were transferred to us by employees \nin satisfaction of tax withholding obligations associated with the vesting of restricted stock units. These purchases were made pursuant to \na separate authorization by our Board of Directors and are not included within the share repurchase program described above. \nTable of Contents \n27\n\n\nITEM 6.\nSelected Financial Data\n(In millions, except per share data)\n2022\n2021\n2020\n2019\n2018\nOperating results\nNet sales\n$ \n65,984 $ \n6",

This reflects a $44.6 billion \nincrease over the FY 2023 request for national defense spending, and a $43.7 billion increase for the DoD.\nThe FY 2023 Omnibus Appropriations Act also provided separate and additional funding of $47 billion for Ukraine, the \nfourth supplemental since March of 2022, bringing the total amount of supplemental funding authority provided to $113 billion.\nThe President’s FY 2024 budget request is anticipated to be submitted to Congress in March 2023, initiating the FY 2024 \ndefense authorization and appropriations legislative process.

Overall, our sales were negatively affected in 2022 because of supply chain impacts.\nProduct Sales\nProduct sales decreased $1.0 billion, or 2%, in 2022 as compared to 2021. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower \nproduct sales of approximately $670 million at RMS mostly due to lower production volume on Black Hawk and lower net \nsales for training and logistics solutions (TLS) programs due to the delivery of an international pilot training system in the first \nquarter of 2021; about $315 million at Space primarily due to the renationalization of AWE on June 30, 2021, partially offset \nby higher development volume (Next Generation Interceptor (NGI)); and approximately $220 million at MFC primarily due to \nlower volume on Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) and air dominance weapon systems.  These decreases were \npartially offset by higher product sales of about $240 million at Aeronautics mostly due to higher volume on classified contracts \nthat were partially offset by lower volume on F-35 contracts.\nService Sales\nService sales decreased $91 million, or 1%, in 2022 as compared to 2021. The decrease in service sales was primarily due \nto lower sales of approximately $155 million at MFC primarily due to lower volume on the Special Operations Forces Global \nLogistics Support Services (SOF GLSS) program.\nCost of Sales \nCost of sales, for both products and services, consist of materials, labor, subcontracting costs and an allocation of indirect \ncosts (overhead and general and administrative), as well as the costs to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes \nreferred to as offset agreements, required under certain contracts with international customers.

This provision is expected to increase our 2023 \ncash tax liability by approximately $575 million. The actual impact on 2023 cash tax liability will depend on the amount of \nresearch and development expenses paid or incurred in 2023 among other factors.

Backlog was \napproximately $150.0 billion and $135.4 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021. These amounts included both funded backlog \n(firm orders for which funding has been both authorized and appropriated by the customer) and unfunded backlog (firm orders \nfor which funding has not yet been appropriated). Backlog does not include unexercised options or task orders to be issued \nunder indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contracts. Funded backlog was approximately $95.5 billion at December 31, 2022, \nas compared to $88.5 billion at December 31, 2021. If any of our contracts with firm orders were to be terminated, our backlog \nwould be reduced by the expected value of the unfilled orders of such contracts.\nManagement evaluates performance on our contracts by focusing on net sales and operating profit and not by type or \namount of operating expense. Consequently, our discussion of business segment performance focuses on net sales and operating \nprofit, consistent with our approach for managing the business. This approach is consistent throughout the life cycle of our \ncontracts, as management assesses the bidding of each contract by focusing on net sales and operating profit and monitors \nperformance on our contracts in a similar manner through their completion.\nWe regularly provide customers with reports of our costs as the contract progresses. The cost information in the reports is \naccumulated in a manner specified by the requirements of each contract. For example, cost data provided to a customer for a \nproduct would typically align to the subcomponents of that product (such as a wing-box on an aircraft) and for services would \nalign to the type of work being performed (such as aircraft sustainment). Our contracts generally allow for the recovery of costs \nin the pricing of our products and services.

We also may enter into long-term supply contracts for certain materials or components to coincide with the \nproduction schedule of certain products and to ensure their availability at known unit prices.\nMany of our contracts span several years and include highly complex technical requirements. At the outset of a contract, \nwe identify and monitor risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract and assess the \neffects of those risks on our estimates of total costs to complete the contract. The estimates consider the technical requirements \n(e.g., a newly-developed product versus a mature product), the schedule and associated tasks (e.g., the number and type of \nmilestone events) and costs (e.g., material, labor, subcontractor, overhead and the estimated costs to fulfill our industrial \ncooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, required under certain contracts with international \ncustomers). The initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical \nrequirements, schedule and costs in the initial estimated total costs to complete the contract and variable considerations. Profit \nbooking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks related to the technical, \nTable of Contents \n40\n\n\nschedule and cost aspects of the contract, which decreases the estimated total costs to complete the contract.

Changes in volume refer to \nincreases or decreases in sales or operating profit resulting from varying production activity levels, deliveries or service levels \non individual contracts. Volume changes in segment operating profit are typically based on the current profit booking rate for a \nparticular contract.\nIn addition, comparability of our segment sales, operating profit and operating margin may be impacted favorably or \nunfavorably by changes in profit booking rates on our contracts for which we recognize revenue over time using the \npercentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method to measure progress towards completion. Increases in the profit booking rates, \ntypically referred to as favorable profit adjustments, usually relate to revisions in the estimated total costs to fulfill the \nperformance obligations that reflect improved conditions on a particular contract. Conversely, conditions on a particular \ncontract may deteriorate, resulting in an increase in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations and a \nreduction in the profit booking rate and are typically referred to as unfavorable profit adjustments. Increases or decreases in \nprofit booking rates are recognized in the current period they are determined and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such \nchanges. Segment operating profit and margin may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other items, which may or \nmay not impact sales. Favorable items may include the positive resolution of contractual matters, cost recoveries on severance \nand restructuring, insurance recoveries and gains on sales of assets. Unfavorable items may include the adverse resolution of \ncontractual matters; COVID-19 impacts or supply chain disruptions; restructuring charges (except for significant severance \nactions, which are excluded from segment operating results); reserves for disputes; certain asset impairments; and losses on \nsales of certain assets.\nOur consolidated net profit booking rate adjustments increased segment operating profit by approximately $1.8 billion in \n2022 and $2.0 billion in 2021.

Our principal source of liquidity is our cash \nfrom operations. However, we also have access to credit markets, if needed, for liquidity or general corporate purposes, \nincluding share repurchases.  This access includes our $3.0 billion revolving credit facility or the ability to issue commercial \npaper, and letters of credit to support customer advance payments and for other trade finance purposes such as guaranteeing our \nperformance on particular contracts. We believe our cash and cash equivalents, our expected cash flow generated from \noperations and our access to credit markets will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements and cash deployment plans over the \nnext twelve months and beyond based on our current business plans.\nCash received from customers, either from the payment of invoices for work performed or for advances from non-U.S. \ngovernment customers in excess of costs incurred, is our primary source of cash from operations. We generally do not begin \nwork on contracts until funding is appropriated by the customer. However, from time to time, we fund customer programs \nourselves pending government appropriations. If we incur costs in excess of funds obligated on the contract or in advance of a \ncontract award, this negatively affects our cash flows and we may be at risk for reimbursement of the excess costs.\nBilling timetables and payment terms on our contracts vary based on a number of factors, including the contract type. We \ngenerally bill and collect cash more frequently under cost-reimbursable contracts, which represented approximately 38% of the \nsales we recorded in 2022, as we are authorized to bill as the costs are incurred. A number of our fixed-price contracts may \nprovide for performance-based payments, which allow us to bill and collect cash as we perform on the contract. The amount of \nperformance-based payments and the related milestones are encompassed in the negotiation of each contract. The timing of \nsuch payments may differ from the timing of the costs incurred related to our contract performance, thereby affecting our cash \nflows.\nThe U.S. Government has indicated that it would consider progress payments as the baseline for negotiating payment terms \non fixed-price contracts, rather than performance-based payments. In contrast to negotiated performance-based payment terms, \nprogress payment provisions correspond to a percentage of the amount of costs incurred during the performance of the contract \nand are invoiced regularly as costs are incurred.

While the impact of policy changes or withholding payments may \ndelay the receipt of cash, the cumulative amount of cash collected during the life of the contract should not vary.\nTo date, the effects of COVID-19 have resulted in some negative impacts on our cash flows, partially due to supplier \ndisruptions and delays. The U.S. Government has taken certain actions and enacted legislation to mitigate the impacts of \nCOVID-19 on public health, the economy, state and local governments, individuals, and businesses. Since the pandemic began, \nLockheed Martin has remained committed to accelerating payments to the supply chain with a focus on small and at risk \nbusinesses. As of December 31, 2022, we have accelerated $1.5 billion of payments to our suppliers that are due by their terms \nin future periods. We will continue to monitor supply chain risks, especially at small and at-risk related suppliers, and may \ncontinue to utilize accelerated payments in 2023 on an as needed basis. \nIn addition, we have a balanced cash deployment strategy to invest in our business and key technologies to provide our \ncustomers with enhanced capabilities, enhance stockholder value, and position ourselves to take advantage of new business \nTable of Contents \n45\n\n\nopportunities when they arise. Consistent with that strategy, we have continued to invest in our business and technologies \nthrough capital expenditures, independent research and development, and selective business acquisitions and investments. \nWe have returned cash to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases. On October 17, 2022, the Board of \nDirectors authorized an additional $14.0 billion to the program. During the fourth quarter of 2022, we entered into an \naccelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreement to repurchase $4.0 billion of our common stock and issued $4.0 billion of senior \nunsecured notes. As of December 31, 2022, the total remaining authorization for future common share repurchases under our \nprogram was $10.0 billion, which is expected to be utilized over a three-year period.

The decrease at Aeronautics was primarily due to timing of \nproduction and billing cycles impacting contract assets (primarily F-35). The decrease at MFC was primarily due to timing of \naccounts receivables collections. The decrease at RMS was primarily due to liquidation of inventories (primarily TLS and \nSikorsky helicopter programs) in 2021 that did not recur in 2022. As of December 31, 2022, we accelerated $1.5 billion of \npayments to suppliers that were due in the first quarter of 2023, compared to $2.2 billion of payments to suppliers as of \nDecember 31, 2021 that were due in the first quarter of 2022.

Cost-plus-award-fee contracts provide for an \naward fee that varies within specified limits based on the customer’s assessment of our performance against a predetermined set \nof criteria, such as targets based on cost, quality, technical and schedule criteria. Cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts provide for \nreimbursement of costs plus a fee, which is adjusted by a formula based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total \ntarget costs (i.e., incentive based on cost) or reimbursement of costs plus an incentive to exceed stated performance targets (i.e., \nTable of Contents \n50\n\n\nincentive based on performance). Cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts provide a fixed fee that is negotiated at the inception of the \ncontract and does not vary with actual costs.\nWe assess each contract at its inception to determine whether it should be combined with other contracts. When making \nthis determination, we consider factors such as whether two or more contracts were negotiated and executed at or near the same \ntime or were negotiated with an overall profit objective. If combined, we treat the combined contracts as a single contract for \nrevenue recognition purposes.\nWe evaluate the products or services promised in each contract at inception to determine whether the contract should be \naccounted for as having one or more performance obligations. The products and services in our contracts are typically not \ndistinct from one another due to their complex relationships and the significant contract management functions required to \nperform under the contract. Accordingly, our contracts are typically accounted for as one performance obligation. In limited \ncases, our contracts have more than one distinct performance obligation, which occurs when we perform activities that are not \nhighly complex or interrelated or involve different product lifecycles.

We primarily sell customized solutions unique to a \ncustomer’s specifications. When it is necessary to allocate the transaction price to multiple performance obligations, we \ntypically use the expected cost plus a reasonable profit margin to estimate the standalone selling price of each product or \nservice.

Funding of our qualified \ndefined benefit pension plans is determined in a manner consistent with CAS and in accordance with the Employee Retirement \nIncome Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), as amended, along with consideration of CAS and Internal Revenue Code rules. Our \ngoal has been to fund the pension plans to a level of at least 80%, as determined in accordance with ERISA.

We also are involved in environmental remediation activities at sites where \nformal agreements either do not exist or do not quantify the extent and timing of our obligations. Environmental remediation \nactivities usually span many years, which makes estimating the costs more judgmental due to, for example, changing \nremediation technologies. To determine the costs related to clean up sites, we have to assess the extent of contamination, effects \non natural resources, the appropriate technology to be used to accomplish the remediation, and evolving environmental \nstandards.\nWe perform quarterly reviews of environmental remediation sites and record liabilities and receivables in the period it \nbecomes probable that the liabilities have been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated (see the discussion under \n“Environmental Matters” in “Note 1 – Organization and Significant Accounting Policies” and “Note 14 – Legal Proceedings, \nCommitments and Contingencies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). We consider the above factors \nin our quarterly estimates of the timing and amount of any future costs that may be required for environmental remediation \nactivities, which result in the calculation of a range of estimates for each particular environmental remediation site. We do not \ndiscount the recorded liabilities, as the amount and timing of future cash payments are not fixed or cannot be reliably \ndetermined.

Under existing U.S. Government regulations, these and other \nenvironmental expenditures relating to our U.S. Government business, after deducting any recoveries received from insurance \nor other PRPs, are allowable in establishing prices of our products and services. As a result, most of the expenditures we incur \nare included in our net sales and cost of sales according to U.S. Government agreement or regulation, regardless of the contract \nform (e.g. cost-reimbursable, fixed-price). We continually evaluate the recoverability of our assets for the portion of \nenvironmental costs that are probable of future recovery by assessing, among other factors, U.S. Government regulations, our \nU.S. Government business base and contract mix, our history of receiving reimbursement of such costs, and efforts by some \nU.S. Government representatives to limit such reimburse",

For example, if we were to determine that the liabilities \nshould be increased by $100 million, the corresponding amount that is probable of future recovery would be increased by \napproximately $89 million, with the remainder recorded as a charge to earnings. This allocation is determined annually, based \nupon our existing and projected business activities with the U.S. Government.\nWe cannot reasonably determine the extent of our financial exposure at all environmental remediation sites with which we \nare involved. There are a number of former operating facilities we are monitoring or investigating for potential future \nenvironmental remediation. In some cases, although a loss may be probable, it is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate \nthe amount of any obligation for remediation activities because of uncertainties (e.g., assessing the extent of the contamination). \nDuring any particular quarter, such uncertainties may be resolved, allowing us to estimate and recognize the initial liability to \nTable of Contents \n55\n\n\nremediate a particular former operating site. The amount of the liability could be material. Upon recognition of the liability, a \nportion will be recognized as a receivable with the remainder charged to earnings, which may have a material effect in any \nparticular interim reporting period.\nIf we are ultimately found to have liability at those sites where we have been designated a PRP, we expect that the actual \ncosts of environmental remediation will be shared with other liable PRPs. Generally, PRPs that are ultimately determined to be \nresponsible parties are strictly liable for site remediation and usually agree among themselves to share, on an allocated basis, the \ncosts and expenses for environmental investigation and remediation.

The Corporation estimates \nprofit on these contracts as the difference between total estimated revenues and total estimated cost at \ncompletion. \nThe percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method requires management to make significant estimates \nand assumptions to estimate contract sales and costs associated with its contracts with customers.  At the \noutset of a long-term contract, the Corporation identifies risks to the achievement of the technical, \nschedule and cost aspects of the contract. Throughout the contract life cycle, the Corporation monitors \nand assesses the effects of those risks on its estimates of sales and total costs to complete the contract.  \nProfit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if the Corporation successfully \nretires risks surrounding the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract, which would decrease \nthe estimated total costs to complete the contract.  Conversely, the profit booking rates may decrease if \nthe estimated total costs to complete the contract increase.  Changes to the profit booking rates resulting \nfrom changes in estimates could have a material effect on the Corporation’s results of operations.  \nAuditing the Corporation’s estimate-at-completion analyses used in its revenue recognition process was \ncomplex due to the judgment involved in evaluating the significant estimates and assumptions made by \nmanagement in the creation and subsequent updates to the Corporation’s estimate-at-completion \nanalyses.

As explained in \nNote 11 of the consolidated financial statements, the Corporation remeasures the qualified defined benefit \npension assets and obligations at the end of each year or more frequently upon the occurrence of certain \nevents.  The amounts are measured using actuarial valuations, which depend on key assumptions such as \nthe discount rate.\nAuditing the defined benefit pension obligation was complex and required the involvement of specialists \nas a result of the judgmental nature of the actuarial assumptions such as the discount rate used in the \nmeasurement process. The discount rate assumption has a significant effect on the measurement of the \nprojected benefit obligation.\nTable of Contents \n61\n\n\nHow We \nAddressed the \nMatter in Our \nAudit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of relevant \ninternal controls over management’s measurement and valuation of the defined benefit pension obligation \ncalculations.

Accordingly, the AWE program’s ongoing operations, including the entity that manages the \nprogram, are no longer included in our financial results as of that date. Therefore, during 2021, AWE only generated sales of \n$885 million and operating profit of $18 million, which are included in Space’s financial results for the year ended December \n31, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2020, AWE generated sales of $1.4 billion and operating profit of $35 million, \nwhich are included in Space’s financial results for 2020.\nBasis of presentation – These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of subsidiaries we control and \nvariable interest entities if we are the primary beneficiary. We eliminate intercompany balances and transactions in \nconsolidation. We classify certain assets and liabilities as current utilizing the duration of the related contract or program as our \noperating cycle, which is generally longer than one year. This primarily impacts receivables, contract assets, inventories, and \ncontract liabilities. We classify all other assets and liabilities based on whether the asset will be realized or the liability will be \npaid within one year.\nUse of estimates – We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted \naccounting principles (GAAP). In doing so, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported \nin the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.

Our \nactual results may differ materially from these estimates. Significant estimates inherent in the preparation of our consolidated \nfinancial statements include, but are not limited to, accounting for sales and cost recognition; postretirement benefit plans; \nenvironmental liabilities and assets for the portion of environmental costs that are probable of future recovery; evaluation of \ngoodwill, intangible assets, investments and other assets for impairment; income taxes including deferred income taxes; fair \nvalue measurements; and contingencies.\nRevenue Recognition – The majority of our net sales are generated from long-term contracts with the U.S. Government \nand international customers (including foreign military sales (FMS) contracted through the U.S. Government) for the research, \ndesign, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services. We \naccount for a contract when it has approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment \nterms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. For certain contracts \nthat meet the foregoing requirements, primarily international direct commercial sale contracts, we are required to obtain certain \nregulatory approvals. In these cases, we recognize revenue when it is probable that we will receive regulatory approvals based \nupon all known facts and circumstances. We provide our products and services under fixed-price and cost-reimbursable \ncontracts.\nUnder fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform the specified work for a pre-determined price. To the extent our actual \ncosts vary from the estimates upon which the price was negotiated, we will generate more or less profit or could incur a loss. \nSome fixed-price contracts have a performance-based component under which we may earn incentive payments or incur \nfinancial penalties based on our performance.\nCost-reimbursable contracts provide for the payment of allowable costs incurred during performance of the contract plus a \nfee up to a ceiling based on the amount that has been funded. Typically, we enter into three types of cost-reimbursable \ncontracts: cost-plus-award-fee, cost-plus-incentive-fee, and cost-plus-fixed-fee. Cost-plus-award-fee contracts provide for an \naward fee that varies within specified limits based on the customer’s assessment of our performance against a predetermined set \nof criteria, such as targets based on cost, quality, technical and schedule criteria. Cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts provide for \nreimbursement of costs plus a fee, which is adjusted by a formula based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total \nTable of Contents \n68\n\n\ntarget costs (i.e., incentive based on cost) or reimbursement of costs plus an incentive to exceed ",

Cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts provide a fixed fee that is negotiated at the inception of the \ncontract and does not vary with actual costs.\nWe assess each contract at its inception to determine whether it should be combined with other contracts. When making \nthis determination, we consider factors such as whether two or more contracts were negotiated and executed at or near the same \ntime or were negotiated with an overall profit objective. If combined, we treat the combined contracts as a single contract for \nrevenue recognition purposes.\nWe evaluate the products or services promised in each contract at inception to determine whether the contract should be \naccounted for as having one or more performance obligations. The products and services in our contracts are typically not \ndistinct from one another due to their complex relationships and the significant contract management functions required to \nperform under the contract. Accordingly, our contracts are typically accounted for as one performance obligation. In limited \ncases, our contracts have more than one distinct performance obligation, which occurs when we perform activities that are not \nhighly complex or interrelated or involve different product lifecycles. Significant judgment is required in determining \nperformance obligations, and these decisions could change the amount of revenue and profit recorded in a given period. We \nclassify net sales as products or services on our consolidated statements of earnings based on the predominant attributes of the \nperformance obligations.\nWe determine the transaction price for each contract based on the consideration we expect to receive for the products or \nservices being provided under the contract. For contracts where a portion of the price may vary (e.g. awards, incentive fees and \nclaims), we estimate variable consideration at the most likely amount, which is included in the transaction price to the extent it \nis probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. We analyze the risk of a significant \nrevenue reversal and if necessary constrain the amount of variable consideration recognized in order to mitigate this risk.\nAt the inception of a contract we estimate the transaction price based on our current rights and do not contemplate future \nmodifications (including unexercised options) or follow-on contracts until they become legally enforceable. Contracts are often \nsubsequently modified to include changes in specifications, requirements or price, which may create new or change existing \nenforceable rights and obligations. Depending on the nature of the modification, we consider whether to account for the \nmodification as an adjustment to the existing contract or as a separate contract.

The \nstandalone selling price represents the amount we would sell the product or service to a customer on a standalone basis (i.e., not \nbundled with any other products or services). Our contracts with the U.S. Government, including FMS contracts, are subject to \nthe Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) and the price is typically based on estimated or actual costs plus a reasonable profit \nmargin. As a result of these regulations, the standalone selling price of products or services in our contracts with the U.S. \nGovernment and FMS contracts are typically equal to the selling price stated in the contract.\nFor non-U.S. Government contracts with multiple performance obligations, we evaluate whether the stated selling prices \nfor the products or services represent their standalone selling prices. We primarily sell customized solutions unique to a \ncustomer’s specifications. When it is necessary to allocate the transaction price to multiple performance obligations, we \ntypically use the expected cost plus a reasonable profit margin to estimate the standalone selling price of each product or \nservice. We occasionally sell standard products or services with observable standalone sales transactions. In these situations, the \nobservable standalone sales transactions are used to determine the standalone selling price.\nWe recognize revenue as performance obligations are satisfied and the customer obtains control of the products and \nservices. In determining when performance obligations are satisfied, we consider factors such as contract terms, payment terms \nand whether there is an alternative future use of the product or service. Substantially all of our revenue is recognized over time \nas we perform under the contract because control of the work in process transfers continuously to the customer. For most \ncontracts with the U.S. Government and FMS contracts, this continuous transfer of control of the work in process to the \ncustomer is supported by clauses in the contract that give the customer ownership of work in process and allow the customer to \nunilaterally terminate the contract for convenience and pay us for costs incurred plus a reasonable profit. For most non-U.S. \nGovernment contracts, primarily international direct commercial contracts, continuous transfer of control to our customer is \nsupported because we deliver products that do not have an alternative use to us and if our customer were to terminate the \ncontract for reasons other than our non-performance we would have the right to recover",

Under the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress, the extent of progress \ntowards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs to complete the \nperformance obligation(s). For performance obligations to provide services to the customer, revenue is recognized over time \nbased on costs incurred or the right to invoice method (in situations where the value transferred matches our billing rights) as \nour customer receives and consumes the benefits.\nFor performance obligations in which control does not continuously transfer to the customer, we recognize revenue at the \npoint in time in which each performance obligation is fully satisfied. This coincides with the point in time the customer obtains \ncontrol of the product or service, which typically occurs upon customer acceptance or receipt of the product or service, given \nthat we maintain control of the product or service until that point.\nBacklog (i.e., unfulfilled or remaining performance obligations) represents the sales we expect to recognize for our \nproducts and services for which control has not yet transferred to the customer. It is converted into sales in future periods as \nwork is performed or deliveries are made. For our cost-reimbursable and fixed-priced-incentive contracts, the estimated \nconsideration we expect to receive pursuant to the terms of the contract may exceed the contractual award amount. The \nestimated consideration is determined at the outset of the contract and is continuously reviewed throughout the contract period. \nIn determining the estimated consideration, we consider the risks related to the technical, schedule and cost impacts to complete \nthe contract and an estimate of any variable consideration. Periodically, we review these risks and may increase or decrease \nbacklog accordingly. As the risks on such contracts are successfully retired, the estimated consideration from customers may be \nreduced, resulting in a reduction of backlog without a corresponding recognition of sales.

Billing timetables and payment terms on our contracts vary based on a number of \nfactors, including the contract type. Typical payment terms under fixed-price contracts with the U.S. Government provide that \nthe customer pays either performance-based payments (PBPs) based on the achievement of contract milestones or progress \npayments based on a percentage of costs we incur. Typical payment terms under cost-reimbursable contracts with the U.S \nGovernment provide for billing of allowable costs incurred plus applicable fee on a monthly or semi-monthly basis. For the \nmajority of our international direct commercial contracts to deliver complex systems, we typically receive advance payments \nprior to commencement of work, as well as milestone payments that are paid in accordance with the terms of our contract as we \nperform. We recognize a liability for payments in excess of revenue recognized, which is presented as a contract liability on the \nbalance sheet. The portion of payments retained by the customer until final contract settlement is not considered a significant \nfinancing component because the intent is to protect the customer from our failure to adequately complete some or all of the \nobligations under the contract.

The carrying amounts of these were $589 million and $577 million at December 31, 2022 and \nDecember 31, 2021 and are included on our consolidated balance sheets within other assets, both current and noncurrent. \nDuring 2022, we recorded $114 million ($86 million, or $0.33 per share, after-tax) of net losses, compared to net gains of \n$265 million ($199 million, or $0.72 per share, after-tax) during 2021, due to changes in fair value and/or sales of investments \nwhich are reflected in the other non-operating income, net account on our consolidated statements of earnings.\nEquity method investments – Investments where we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but do not control, \nare accounted for under the equity method of accounting and are included in other noncurrent assets on our consolidated \nbalance sheets. Significant influence typically exists if we have a 20% to 50% ownership interest in the investee. Under this \nmethod of accounting, our share of the net earnings or losses of the investee is included in operating profit in other income, net \non our consolidated statements of earnings since the activities of the investee are closely aligned with the operations of the \nbusiness segment holding the investment. We evaluate our equity method investments for impairment whenever events or \nchanges in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such investments may be impaired. If a decline in the value of \nan equity method investment is determined to be other than temporary, a loss is recorded in earnings in the current period. As of \nDecember 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, our equity method investments totaled $685 million and $689 million, which was \nprimarily composed of our investment in the United Launch Alliance (ULA) joint venture.

As a result, we adjusted the carrying value of our \ninvestment to the selling price of $307 million, which resulted in the recognition of a noncash impairment charge of \n$128 million ($96 million, or $0.34 per share, after-tax) in our results of operations disclosed in 2020. \nGoodwill and Intangible Assets – The assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded under the acquisition \nmethod of accounting at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values \nassigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses. Intangible assets from acquired businesses are \nrecognized at fair value on the acquisition date and consist of customer programs, trademarks, customer relationships, \ntechnology and other intangible assets. Customer programs include values assigned to major programs of acquired businesses \nand represent the aggregate value associated with the customer relationships, contracts, technology and trademarks underlying \nthe associated program. Intangible assets are amortized over a period of expected cash flows used to measure fair value, which \ntypically ranges from five to 20 years.\nWe perform an impairment test of our goodwill at least annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently whenever events \nor changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired. Such events or changes in circumstances \nmay include a significant deterioration in overall economic conditions, changes in the business climate of our industry, a \ndecline in our market capitalization, operating performance indicators, competition, reorganizations of our business, U.S. \nGovernment budget restrictions or the disposal of all or a portion of a reporting unit. Our goodwill has been allocated to and is \ntested for impairment at a level referred to as the reporting unit, which is typically a level below our business segments. The \nlevel at which we test goodwill for impairment requires us to determine whether the operations below the business segment \nconstitute a self-sustaining business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly \nreviews the operating results.\nWe may use either a qualitative or quantitative approach when testing a reporting unit’s goodwill for impairment. For \nselected reporting units where we use the qualitative approach, we perform a qualitative evaluation of events and circumstances \nimpacting the reporting unit to determine the likelihood of goodwill i",

Based on that qualitative evaluation, if we \ndetermine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, no further evaluation is \nnecessary. Otherwise we perform a quantitative impairment test. We perform quantitative tests for most reporting units at least \nonce every three years. However, for certain reporting units we may perform a quantitative impairment test every year.\nFor the quantitative impairment test we compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. \nIf the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. If the carrying \nvalue of the reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, a goodwill impairment loss is recognized in an amount \nequal to that excess. We generally estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of a discounted cash flow \n(DCF) analysis and market-based valuation methodologies such as comparable public company trading values and values \nobserved in recent business acquisitions. Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgments, including the \namount and timing of expected future cash flows, long-term growth rates, discount rates and relevant comparable public \ncompany earnings multiples and relevant transaction multiples. The cash flows employed in the DCF analysis are based on our \nbest estimate of future sales, earnings and cash flows after considering factors such as general market conditions, U.S. \nGovernment budgets, existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements, changes in \nworking capital, long term business plans and recent operating performance.

Substantially all of our leases are long-term operating leases with fixed payment \nterms. We do not have significant financing leases. Our right-of-use (ROU) operating lease assets represent our right to use an \nunderlying asset for the lease term, and our operating lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments. ROU \noperating lease assets are recorded in other noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease liabilities are \nrecorded in other current liabilities or other noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet based on their contractual \ndue dates.\nBoth the ROU operating lease asset and liability are recognized as of the lease commencement date at the present value of \nthe lease payments over the lease term. Most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate that can readily be determined. \nTherefore, we use a discount rate based on our incremental borrowing rate, which is determined using our credit rating and \ninformation available as of the commencement date. ROU operating lease assets include lease payments made at or before the \nlease commencement date, net of any lease incentives.\nOur operating lease agreements may include options to extend the lease term or terminate it early. We include options to \nextend or terminate leases in the ROU operating lease asset and liability when it is reasonably certain we will exercise these \noptions. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is included in cost of sales on our \nconsolidated statement of earnings.\nWe have operating lease arrangements with lease and non-lease components. The non-lease components in our \narrangements are not significant when compared to the lease components. For all operating leases, we account for the lease and \nnon-lease components as a single component.

The Revolving Credit Agreement matures on August 24, 2027. However, we \nmay request that commitments be renewed for additional one-year periods under certain circumstances as set forth in the \nRevolving Credit Agreement. The Revolving Credit Agreement is available for any of our lawful corporate purposes, including \nsupporting commercial paper borrowings. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement are unsecured and bear interest at \nrates set forth in the Revolving Credit Agreement. The Revolving Credit Agreement contains customary representations, \nwarranties and covenants, including covenants restricting ours and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to encumber assets and \nour ability to merge or consolidate with another entity. The Revolving Credit Agreement replaces our revolving credit \nagreement (the “Former Credit Agreement”), which had been scheduled to mature on August 24, 2026. The Former Credit \nAgreement, which had a total capacity of $3.0 billion and was undrawn, was terminated effective August 24, 2022.

Sikorsky Aircraft Corp., et al.\nAs a result of our acquisition of Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation (Sikorsky), we assumed the defense of and any potential \nliability for two civil False Claims Act lawsuits pending in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. In \nOctober 2014, the U.S. Government filed a complaint in intervention in the first suit, which was brought by qui tam relator \nMary Patzer, a former Derco Aerospace (Derco) employee. In May 2017, the U.S. Government filed a complaint in intervention \nin a second suit, which was brought by qui tam relator Peter Cimma, a former Sikorsky Support Services, Inc. (SSSI) employee. \nIn November 2017, the Court consolidated the cases into a single action for discovery and trial.\nThe U.S. Government alleges that Sikorsky and two of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Derco and SSSI, violated the civil \nFalse Claims Act and the Truth in Negotiations Act in connection with a contract the U.S. Navy awarded to SSSI in June 2006 \nto support the Navy’s T-34 and T-44 fixed-wing turboprop training aircraft. SSSI subcontracted with Derco, primarily to \nprocure and manage spare parts for the training aircraft. The U.S. Government contends that SSSI overbilled the Navy on the \ncontract as the result of Derco’s use of prohibited cost-plus-percentage-of-cost (CPPC) pricing to add profit and overhead costs \nas a percentage of the price of the spare parts that Derco procured and then sold to SSSI. The U.S. Government also alleges that \nDerco’s claims to SSSI, SSSI’s claims to the Navy, and SSSI’s yearly Certificates of Final Indirect Costs from 2006 through \n2012 were false and that SSSI submitted inaccurate cost or pricing data in violation of the Truth in Negotiations Act for a sole-\nsourced, follow-on “bridge” contract. The U.S. Government’s complaints assert common law claims for breach of contract and \nunjust enrichment. On November 29, 2021, the District Court granted the U.S. Government’s motion for partial summary \njudgment, finding that the Derco-SSSI agreement was a CPPC contract.\nWe believe that we have legal and factual defenses to the U.S. Government’s remaining claims.

Metropolitan Transportation Authority\nOn April 24, 2009, we filed a declaratory judgment action against the New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority \nand its Capital Construction Company (collectively, the MTA) asking the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New \nYork to find that the MTA is in material breach of our agreement based on the MTA’s failure to provide access to sites where \nwork must be performed and the customer-furnished equipment necessary to complete the contract. The MTA filed an answer \nand counterclaim alleging that we breached the contract and subsequently terminated the contract for alleged default. The \nprimary damages sought by the MTA are the costs to complete the contract and potential re-procurement costs. While we are \nunable to estimate the cost of another contractor to complete the contract and the costs of re-procurement, we note that our \ncontract with the MTA had a total value of $323 million, of which $241 million was paid to us, and that the MTA is seeking \ndamages of approximately $190 million. We dispute the MTA’s allegations and are defending against them. Additionally, \nfollowing an investigation, our sureties on a performance bond related to this matter, who were represented by independent \ncounsel, concluded that the MTA’s termination of the contract was improper. Finally, our declaratory judgment action was later \namended to include claims for monetary damages against the MTA of approximately $95 million.

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation’s internal control \nover financial reporting based on our audit.
