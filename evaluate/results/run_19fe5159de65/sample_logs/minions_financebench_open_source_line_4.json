  "question": "What drove operating margin change as of FY2022 for 3M? If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then please state that and explain why.",
  "predicted_answer": "3M's operating margin decreased from 20.8% in 2021 to 19.1% in 2022, driven by a $0.8 billion pre-tax charge for PFAS exit, $1.2 billion litigation charge, and increased costs in raw materials and logistics.",
  "ground_truth": [
    "Operating Margin for 3M in FY2022 has decreased by 1.7% primarily due to: \n-Decrease in gross Margin\n-mostly one-off charges including Combat Arms Earplugs litigation, impairment related to exiting PFAS manufacturing, costs related to exiting Russia and divestiture-related restructuring\ncharges"

  "correctness_reasoning": "The predicted answer correctly identifies the decrease in operating margin and attributes it to significant charges related to PFAS exit and litigation, which aligns with the ground truth. It also mentions increased costs in raw materials and logistics, which is additional context but does not contradict the ground truth. The numerical change in operating margin is within the 10% tolerance range."
