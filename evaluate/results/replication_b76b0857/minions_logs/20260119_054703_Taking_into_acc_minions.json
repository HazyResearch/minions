Total length: 433486 characters to answer this question. \n\nAlso consider the following constraints:\n- In your response do NOT use numbered lists.\n- Do NOT structure your response as a sequence of steps.\n",
      "output": "To answer the question about Corning's 3-year average unadjusted operating income percentage margin from FY2019 to FY2021, focus on extracting specific financial data from the income statement. Identify the operating income figures for each of the fiscal years 2019, 2020, and 2021. Additionally, obtain the total revenue figures for these years, as the operating income percentage margin is calculated by dividing the operating income by total revenue and then multiplying by 100 to convert it to a percentage. Once you have these figures, calculate the operating income percentage for each year, sum them up, and then divide by three to find the average. Ensure that all calculations are precise and round the final average to one decimal place as required."

      "prompt": "# Decomposition Round #1\n\nYou (the supervisor) cannot directly read the document(s). Instead, you can assign small, isolated tasks to a less capable worker model that sees only a single chunk of text at a time. Any cross-chunk or multi-document reasoning must be handled by you.\n\n## Your Job: Write Two Python Functions\n\n### FUNCTION #1: `prepare_jobs(context, prev_job_manifests, prev_job_outputs) -> List[JobManifest]`\n- Break the document(s) into chunks (using the provided chunking function, if needed). Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 12 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`. All **multi-chunk integration** or **global reasoning** is your responsibility here.\n- Return one **aggregated string** suitable for further supervisor inspection.\n\n\n\n## Relevant Pydantic Models\n\nThe following models are already in the global scope. **Do NOT redefine or re-import them.**\n\n### JobManifest Model\n```\nclass JobManifest(BaseModel):\n    chunk: str  # the actual text for the chunk of the document\n    task: str  # the actual task instruction for the small model\n    advice: str  # optional, any additional advice on how to perform the task\n\n    chunk_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    task_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    job_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n\n```\n\n### JobOutput Model\n```\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    citation: Optional[str]\n    answer: Optional[str]\n\n```\n\n## Function Signatures\n```\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        context (List[str]): A list of documents.

      "output": "We have gathered information on operating income and total revenue for Corning for the fiscal years 2019, 2020, and 2021. However, the data is somewhat fragmented and inconsistent, with multiple figures reported for the same metrics.\n\n1. **Operating Income Data:**\n   - We have a figure of $1,568 million (as reported) or $1,949 million (core performance measures) for operating income, but it's unclear which fiscal year these figures pertain to.\n   - Another figure mentions operating income (net income) as -$117 million, but again, the fiscal year is not specified.\n\n2. **Total Revenue Data:**\n   - Total revenue figures are provided for FY2019 ($11,503 million and $11,656 million), FY2020 ($11,452 million and $11,303 million), and FY2021 ($14,082 million).\n   - There are discrepancies in the total revenue figures for FY2019 and FY2020, with different values reported.\n\nTo answer the question about the 3-year average unadjusted operating income percentage margin, we need consistent and clear figures for both operating income and total revenue for each of the three years. The percentage margin is calculated as (Operating Income / Total Revenue) * 100 for each year, and then averaged over the three years.\n\n**Missing Information:**\n- We need clear and consistent operating income figures for FY2019, FY2020, and FY2021.\n- We need to resolve the discrepancies in the total revenue figures for FY2019 and FY2020.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n- Verify and confirm the correct operating income and total revenue figures for each fiscal year.\n- Once we have consistent data, calculate the operating income percentage for each year and then compute the 3-year average. \n\nWithout resolving these discrepancies and obtaining clear figures, we cannot accurately calculate the 3-year average unadjusted operating income percentage margin."

This approach allows us to systematically gather the necessary financial data to calculate the average operating income percentage margin."

Employee Retirement Plans (Continued)\n \nCorning uses a hypothetical yield curve and associated spot rate curve to discount the plan’s projected benefit payments. Once the present value of projected benefit\npayments is calculated, the suggested discount rate is equal to the level rate that results in the same present value. The yield curve is based on actual high-quality corporate\nbonds across the full maturity spectrum, which also includes private placements and eurobonds that are denominated in U.S. currency. The curve is developed from yields on\nhundreds of bonds from four grading sources, Moody’s, S&P, Fitch and the Dominion Bond Rating Service. A bond will be included if at least half of the grades from these\nsources are Aa, non-callable bonds. The very highest 10% yields and the lowest 40% yields are excluded from the curve to eliminate outliers in the bond population.\n \nMortality is one of the key assumptions used in valuing liabilities of retirement plans. It is used to assign a probability of payment for benefits that are contingent upon\nparticipants’ survival. To make this assumption, benefit plan sponsors typically use a base mortality table and an improvement scale to mortality rates for future anticipated\nchanges to historical death rates.\n \nAs of December 31, 2021, Corning updated the adjustmen",

      "output": "### Analysis\n\n1. **Information Gathered:**\n   - We have collected some data on operating income and total revenue for FY2019, FY2020, and FY2021 from various document excerpts.\n   - For operating income, one chunk (Chunk #81) provided figures: FY2019: $1,306 million, FY2020: $509 million, FY2021: $2,112 million.\n   - For total revenue, multiple chunks provided figures: \n     - Chunk #33: FY2019: $11,503 million, FY2020: $11,303 million, FY2021: $14,082 million.\n     - Chunk #81: FY2019: $11,503 million, FY2020: $11,303 million, FY2021: $14,082 million.\n\n2. **Sufficiency of Information:**\n   - The information is sufficient to calculate the operating income percentage margin for each year and derive the 3-year average, as we have consistent figures for both operating income and total revenue for all three years.\n\n3. **Calculation:**\n   - Operating Income Percentage Margin for each year is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Operating Income \\%} = \\left(\\frac{\\text{Operating Income}}{\\text{Total Revenue}}\\right) \\times 100\n     \\]\n   - Using the figures:\n     - FY2019: \\(\\left(\\frac{1,306}{11,503}\\right) \\times 100 \\approx 11.4\\%\\)\n     - FY2020: \\(\\left(\\frac{509}{11,303}\\right) \\times 100 \\approx 4.5\\%\\)\n     - FY2021: \\(\\left(\\frac{2,112}{14,082}\\right) \\times 100 \\approx 15.0\\%\\)\n\n4. **3-Year Average Calculation:**\n   - Average Operating Income Percentage Margin:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Average} = \\frac{11.4 + 4.5 + 15.0}{3} \\approx 10.3\\%\n     \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The 3-year average unadjusted operating income percentage margin for Corning from FY2019 to FY2021 is approximately 10.3\\%. The data from Chunk #81 and Chunk #33 are consistent and provide a reliable basis for this calculation."
