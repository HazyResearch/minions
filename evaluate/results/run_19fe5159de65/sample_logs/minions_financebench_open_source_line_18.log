Based on the information provided primarily in the statement of financial position and the statement of income, what is AES's FY2022 return on assets (ROA)? ROA is defined as: FY2022 net income / (average total assets between FY2021 and FY2022). Round your answer to two decimal places.

--- Predicted Answer ---
3.12%

--- Ground Truth ---
['-0.02']

--- Correctness Evaluation ---
Is correct: False
Confidence: 1.00
Reasoning: The ground truth answer is -0.02, while the predicted answer is 3.12%. The 10% tolerance rule allows for a range of -0.022 to -0.018 for the ground truth answer. The predicted answer of 3.12% is far outside this range, indicating a significant discrepancy. Therefore, the predicted answer is incorrect.
