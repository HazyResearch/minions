Total length: 677343 characters to answer this question. \n\nAlso consider the following constraints:\n- In your response do NOT use numbered lists.\n- Do NOT structure your response as a sequence of steps.\n",
      "output": "To answer the question about American Water Works's FY2021 unadjusted EBITDA, focus on extracting specific figures from the financial document. You need to locate the income statement to find the operating income for FY2021. This figure represents the company's earnings before interest and taxes. Next, turn to the cash flow statement to identify the depreciation and amortization expenses for the same fiscal year. These figures are typically listed under cash flows from operating activities. Once you have both numbers, add them together to calculate the unadjusted EBITDA. Ensure that the final figure is expressed in USD millions, as required by the question."

      "prompt": "# Decomposition Round #1\n\nYou (the supervisor) cannot directly read the document(s). Instead, you can assign small, isolated tasks to a less capable worker model that sees only a single chunk of text at a time. Any cross-chunk or multi-document reasoning must be handled by you.\n\n## Your Job: Write Two Python Functions\n\n### FUNCTION #1: `prepare_jobs(context, prev_job_manifests, prev_job_outputs) -> List[JobManifest]`\n- Break the document(s) into chunks (using the provided chunking function, if needed). Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 12 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`. All **multi-chunk integration** or **global reasoning** is your responsibility here.\n- Return one **aggregated string** suitable for further supervisor inspection.\n\n\n\n## Relevant Pydantic Models\n\nThe following models are already in the global scope. **Do NOT redefine or re-import them.**\n\n### JobManifest Model\n```\nclass JobManifest(BaseModel):\n    chunk: str  # the actual text for the chunk of the document\n    task: str  # the actual task instruction for the small model\n    advice: str  # optional, any additional advice on how to perform the task\n\n    chunk_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    task_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    job_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n\n```\n\n### JobOutput Model\n```\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    citation: Optional[str]\n    answer: Optional[str]\n\n```\n\n## Function Signatures\n```\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        context (List[str]): A list of documents.

BUSINESS\nThe Company\nWith a history dating back to 1886, American Water is the largest and most geographically diverse, publicly-traded water and wastewater utility company in the United States, as measured by\nboth operating revenues and population served. A holding company originally incorporated in Delaware in 1936, the Company employs approximately 6,400 professionals who provide drinking water,\nwastewater and other related services to over 14 million people in 24 states.

Presented in the table below are examples\nof approved regulatory practices:\nRegulatory Practices\nDescription\nStates Allowed\nInfrastructure replacement surcharge\nmechanisms\nAllows rates to change periodically, outside a general rate case proceeding, to reflect recovery of capital investments made to replace infrastructure\nnecessary to sustain safe and reliable services for the Company’s customers. These mechanisms typically involve periodic filings and reviews to ensure\ntransparency.\nIA, IL, IN, KY, MO, NJ, PA,\nTN, VA, WV\nFuture test year\nA “test year” is a period used for setting rates, and a future test year describes the first 12 months that new rates are proposed to be effective. The use of a\nfuture test year allows current or projected revenues, expenses and capital investments to be collected on a more timely basis.\nCA, HI, IA, IL, IN, KY, PA,\nTN, VA\nHybrid test year\nA historical test year sets rates using data from a 12-month period that ends prior to a general rate case filing. A hybrid test year allows an update to\nhistorical data for “known and measurable” changes that occur subsequent to the historical test year.\nMD, MO, NJ, WV\nUtility plant recovery mechanisms\nAllows  recovery  of  the  full  return  on  utility  plant  costs  during  the  construction  period,  instead  of  capitalizing  an  allowance  for  funds  used  during\nconstruction (“AFUDC”). In addition, some states allow the utility to seek pre-approval of certain capital projects and associated costs. In this pre-\napproval process, the PUC may assess the prudency of such projects.\nCA, IL, KY, PA, TN, VA\nExpense mechanisms\nAllows changes in certain operating expenses, which may",

For example, a citizens group in Monterey, California successfully\nadded “Measure J” to the November 2018 election ballot asking voters to decide whether the Monterey Peninsula Water Management District (the “MPWMD”) should conduct a feasibility study\nconcerning the potential purchase of the Monterey water service system assets (the “Monterey system assets”) of the Company’s California subsidiary, and, if feasible, to proceed with a purchase of\nthose assets without an additional public vote. This service territory  represents approximately 40,000 customers. In November 2018, Measure J was certified to have passed. In August 2019, the\nMPWMD’s General Manager issued a report that recommends that the MPWMD board (1) develop criteria to determine which water systems should be considered for acquisition; (2) examine the\nfeasibility of acquiring the Monterey system assets and consider public ownership of smaller systems only if the MPWMD becomes the owner of a larger system; (3) evaluate whether the acquisition of\nthe Monterey system assets by the MPWMD is in the public interest and sufficiently satisfies the criterion of “feasible” as provided in Measure J; (4) ensure there is significant potential for cost savings\nbefore agreeing to commence an acquisition; and (5) develop ",

The scope of these contracts generally includes the\noperation and maintenance of the installation’s water and wastewater systems and a capital program focused on asset replacement and, in certain instances, systems expansion. The replacement of assets\nassumed when a contract is awarded to MSG is completed either through a discrete set of projects executed in the first five years of the contract or through the long term recapitalization program\nperformed over the life of the contract. Traditionally, both of these programs are funded from the contract fee. At times, new assets are required to support the installation’s mission, and the construction\nof these assets is funded by the U.S. government as separate modifications or amendments to the contract. The capital for these assets historically has not been funded through the Company’s debt or\nequity issuances; rather, the Company has used limited working capital for short-term needs under these contracts. In April 2018, the U.S. Army instituted a requirement that a bidder must offer\nfinancing in its proposal for these new capital projects under existing contracts, but the U.S. Army’s implementation of this requirement on existing contracts has limited the need for such financing.\nHowever, recent U.S. Army and Navy Utilities Privatization solicitations have included requirements for the successful bidder to finance discrete initial capital projects over either a five- or ten-year\nperiod after project completion.

MSG is the Company’s remaining primary market-based\nbusiness.\nThe Company also has five contracts with municipal customers to operate and manage water and wastewater facilities and provide other related services through its Contract Services Group\n(“CSG”).\nMilitary Services Group\nMSG operates on 17 military installations under 50-year contracts with the U.S. government as part of its Utilities Privatization Program. The scope of these contracts generally includes the\noperation and maintenance of the installation’s water and wastewater systems and a capital program focused on asset replacement and, in certain instances, systems expansion. The replacement of assets\nassumed when a contract is awarded to MSG is completed either through a discrete set of projects executed in the first five years of the contract or through the long term recapitalization program\nperformed over the life of the contract. Traditionally, both of these programs are funded from the contract fee. At times, new assets are required to support the installation’s mission, and the construction\nof these assets is funded by the U.S. government as separate modifications or amendments to the contract. The capital for these assets historically has not been funded through the Company’s debt or\nequity issuances; rather, the Company has used limited working capital for short-term needs under these contracts. In April 2018, the U.S. Army instituted a requirement that a bidder must offer\nfinancing in its proposal for these new capital projects under existing contracts, but the U.S. Army’s implementation of this requirement on existing contracts has limited the need for such financing.\nHowever, recent U.S. Army and Navy Utilities Privatization solicitations have included requirements for the successful bidder to finance discrete initial capital projects over either a five- or ten-year\nperiod after project completion. Three of MSG’s current contracts require such capital project financing, which the Company is currently addressing through internal sources of liquidity.\nThe  contract  price  for  six of MSG’s contracts  with  the U.S. government  is subject  to redetermination  two years after  commencement  of operations,  and every  three  years thereafter.

Capital expenditures and operating costs associated with the Revised LCR will\nbe determined once the EPA completes its additional review, but as previously noted, costs associated with compliance with federal water quality regulations have been traditionally recognized by PUCs\nas appropriate for inclusion in establishing rates.\n15\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe Company currently estimates that less than 5% of the service lines within its regulated service territories contain lead on either the Company or customer portion of the service line.

The IIJA was signed into law in November 2021 and provides for up to $15 billion for lead service line replacement through\ndrinking water state revolving funds.

With regard to future acquisitions, the Company\nwill work with those communities as part of the acquisition process to set LSL removal goals appropriate for those systems.

In addition to requirements applicable to the\nCompany’s wastewater collection systems, its operations require discharge permits under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (“NPDES”) permit program established under the Clean\nWater Act, which must be renewed every five years. Pursuant to the NPDES permit program, the EPA and implementing states set maximum discharge limits for wastewater effluents and overflows\nfrom wastewater collection systems. Discharges that exceed the limits specified under NPDES permits can lead to the imposition of fines and penalties, and persistent non-compliance could lead to\nsignificant fines and penalties and other compliance costs. In addition, the difficulty of obtaining and complying with NPDES permits, and renewing expiring permits, may impose time and cost burdens\non ",

We are also required to augment our Monterey County sources of water supply to comply with the requirements of the Endangered Species Act. Beginning\nin January 2022, Cal Am currently expects that it will be able to comply with the diversion reduction requirement schedule contained in the 2016 Order, but continued compliance with the diversion\nreduction requirements for 2023 and future years\n27\n\n\nTable of Contents\nwill depend on successful development of alternate water supply sources sufficient to meet customer demand. The 2009 Order and the 2016 Order remain in effect until Cal Am certifies to the SWRCB,\nand the SWRCB concurs, that Cal Am has obtained a permanent supply of water to substitute for past unauthorized Carmel River diversions. While the Company cannot currently predict the likelihood\nor result of any adverse outcome associated with these matters, further attempts to comply with the 2009 Order and the 2016 Order may result in material additional costs or obligations, including fines\nand penalties against our California subsidiary in the event of noncompliance with the 2009 Order and the 2016 Order, which could have a material adverse effect upon us and our business, results o",

The public vote led to the issuance by the\nMPWMD in November 2019 of a preliminary report finding, among other things, that the acquisition of the Monterey system assets by the MPWMD would be economically feasible.

As consolidation activity increases in the water and wastewater\nindustries and competition for acquisitions continues to increase, the prices for suitable acquisition candidates may increase and limit our ability to expand through acquisitions.\nOur Regulated Businesses are subject to condemnation and other proceedings through eminent domain or other similar authorized process, which could materially and adversely affect their results\nof operations and financial condition.\nMunicipalities and other government subdivisions have historically been involved in the provision of water and wastewater services in the United States, and organized efforts may arise from time\nto time in one or more of the service areas in which our Regulated Businesses operate to convert our assets to public ownership and operation through exercise of the governmental power of eminent\ndomain, or another similar authorized process. A municipality, other government subdivision or a citizen group may seek to acquire our assets through eminent domain or such other process, either\ndirectly or indirectly as a result of a citizen petition.\nFor example, in November 2018, Monterey, California ballot Measure J, which was added by a citizens group, was certified as having been approved by a public vote, requiring the MPWMD\nto conduct a study and submit a written plan concerning the feasibility of a potential purchase of the Monterey system assets without an additional public vote. The public vote led to the issuance by the\nMPWMD in November 2019 of a preliminary report finding, among other things, that the acquisition of the Monterey system assets by the MPWMD would be economically feasible. Also, five\nmunicipalities in the Chicago, Illinois area formed a water agency that filed an eminent domain lawsuit against our Illinois subsidiary in January 2013, seeking to condemn a water pipeline that serves\nthose five municipalities. This lawsuit remains pending, and a valuation trial is scheduled for the second quarter of 2022. See Item 1—Business—Regulated Businesses—Condemnation and Eminent\nDomain, which includes additional information regarding these matters.\nFurthermore,  the  law  in  certain  jurisdictions  in  which  our  Regulated  Businesses  operate  provides  for  eminent  domain  rights  allowing  private  property  owners  to  file  a  lawsuit  to  seek  just\ncompensation against a public utility, if the public utility’s infrastructure has been determined to be a substantial cause of damage to that property. In these actions, the plaintiff would not have to prove\nthat the public utility acted negligently.

(“CEMEX”), and\nrequires a combined development permit from the County of Monterey prior to commencement of construction. On April 24, 2019, the County’s Planning Commission voted to approve the permit. In\nJuly 2019, the Board of Supervisors heard appeals filed by MCWD and a public advocacy group, at which time it denied the appeals and approved the permit. In August 2019, MCWD filed a petition in\nMonterey County Superior Court challenging Monterey County’s approval of Cal Am’s combined development permit application and seeking injunctive relief to enjoin Monterey County and Cal Am\nfrom commencing construction of the desalination plant. In October 2019, after a hearing, the court denied, without prejudice, MCWD’s motion for a preliminary injunction, but issued a stay of the\nCounty’s approval of the combined development permit, precluding commencement of physical construction of the desalination plant, but allowing Cal Am to continue to obtain permits needed for the\ndesalination plant’s construction.

If  subsequent  events  indicate  that  the  regulatory  assets  or  liabilities  no  longer  meet  the  criteria  for  probable  future  recovery  or  probable  future  settlement,  the  Company’s\nConsolidated Statements of Operations and financial position could be materially affected.

These contracts contain a single performance obligation,\nthe delivery of water or wastewater services, as the promise to transfer the individual good or service is not separately identifiable from other promises within the contracts and, therefore, is not distinct.\nRevenues are recognized over time, as services are provided. There are generally no significant financing components or variable consideration. Revenues include amounts billed to customers on a cycle\nbasis, and unbilled amounts calculated based on estimated usage from the date of the meter reading associated with the latest customer bill, to the end of the accounting period. The amounts that the\nCompany has a right to invoice are determined by each customer’s actual usage, an indicator that the invoice amount corresponds directly to the value transferred to the customer.\nIncreases or decreases in the volumes delivered to customers and rate mix due to changes in usage patterns in customer classes in the period could be significant to the calculation of unbilled\nrevenue. In addition, changes in the timing of meter reading schedules and the number and type of customers scheduled for each meter reading date would also have an effect on the unbilled revenue\ncalculation. Unbilled revenue for the Company’s regulated utilities as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $162 million and $150 million, respectively.\nThe Company also recognizes revenue when it is probable that future recovery of previously incurred costs or future refunds that are to be credited to customers will occur through the ratemaking\nprocess.\nRevenue from the Company’s former HOS business was generated through various protection programs in which the Company provided fixed fee services to domestic homeowners and smaller\ncommercial customers for interior and exterior water and sewer lines, interior electric and gas lines, heating and cooling systems, water heaters, power surge protection and other related services.

These contracts contain a single performance obligation,\nthe delivery of water or wastewater services, as the promise to transfer the individual good or service is not separately identifiable from other promises within the contracts and, therefore, is not distinct.\nRevenues are recognized over time, as services are provided. There are generally no significant financing components or variable consideration. Revenues include amounts billed to customers on a cycle\nbasis, and unbilled amounts calculated based on estimated usage from the date of the meter reading associated with the latest customer bill, to the end of the accounting period. The amounts that the\nCompany has a right to invoice are determined by each customer’s actual usage, an indicator that the invoice amount corresponds directly to the value transferred to the customer.\nIncreases or decreases in the volumes delivered to customers and rate mix due to changes in usage patterns in customer classes in the period could be significant to the calculation of unbilled\nrevenue. In addition, changes in the timing of meter reading schedules and the number and type of customers scheduled for each meter reading date would also have an effect on the unbilled revenue\ncalculation. Unbilled revenue for the Company’s regulated utilities as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $162 million and $150 million, respectively.\nThe Company also recognizes revenue when it is probable that future recovery of previously incurred costs or future refunds that are to be credited to customers will occur through the ratemaking\nprocess.\nRevenue from the Company’s former HOS business was generated through various protection programs in which the Company provided fixed fee services to domestic homeowners and smaller\ncommercial customers for interior and exterior water and sewer lines, interior electric and gas lines, heating and cooling systems, water heaters, power surge protection and other related services.

Advances from\ncustomers were deferred until the performance obligation was satisfied.\nThe Company also has long-term, fixed fee contracts to operate and maintain water and wastewater systems for the U.S. government on various military installations and facilities owned by\nmunicipal customers.

We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA  company’s  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  is  a  process  designed  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  the  reliability  of  financial  reporting  and  the  preparation  of  financial\nstatements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain\nto the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are\nrecorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in\naccordance  with  authorizations  of  management  and  directors  of  the  company;  and  (iii)  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention  or  timely  detection  of  unauthorized  acquisition,  use,  or\ndisposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.

This  property  is  stated  at  cost,  net  of\naccumulated depreciation, which is calculated using the straight-line method over the useful lives of the assets.\nWhen units of property, plant and equipment are replaced, retired or abandoned, the carrying value is credited against the asset and charged to accumulated depreciation. To the extent the\nCompany recovers cost of removal or other retirement costs through rates after the retirement costs are incurred, a regulatory asset is recorded. In some cases, the Company recovers retirement costs\nthrough rates during the life of the associated asset and before the costs are incurred. These amounts result in a regulatory liability being reported based on the amounts previously recovered through\ncustomer rates, until the costs to retire those assets are incurred.\nThe costs incurred to acquire and internally develop computer software for internal use are capitalized as a unit of property. The carrying value of these costs amounted to $374 million and $360\nmillion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nCash and Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Funds\nSubstantially all cash is invested in interest-bearing accounts.

The Company’s regulated utilities record depreciation in conformity with amounts approved by\nPUCs, after regulatory review of the information the Company submits to support its estimates of the assets’ remaining useful lives.\n88\n\n\nTable of Contents\nNonutility  property  consists  primarily  of  buildings  and  equipment  utilized  by  the  Company’s  Market-Based  Businesses  and  for  internal  operations.  This  property  is  stated  at  cost,  net  of\naccumulated depreciation, which is calculated using the straight-line method over the useful lives of the assets.\nWhen units of property, plant and equipment are replaced, retired or abandoned, the carrying value is credited against the asset and charged to accumulated depreciation. To the extent the\nCompany recovers cost of removal or other retirement costs through rates after the retirement costs are incurred, a regulatory asset is recorded. In some cases, the Company recovers retirement costs\nthrough rates during the life of the associated asset and before the costs are incurred. These amounts result in a regulatory liability being reported based on the amounts previously recovered through\ncustomer rates, until the costs to retire those assets are incurred.\nThe costs incurred to acquire and internally develop computer software for internal use are capitalized as a unit of property. The carrying value of these costs amounted to $374 million and $360\nmillion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nCash and Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Funds\nSubstantially all cash is invested in interest-bearing accounts. All highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased are considered to be cash equivalents.\nRestricted funds consist primarily of proceeds from financings for the construction and capital improvement of facilities, and deposits for future servic",

The Company has proactively improved its pipe renewal rate from a 250-year replacement\ncycle in 2009 to an expected 110-year replacement cycle by 2026, which it anticipates will enable the Company to replace nearly 2,200 miles of mains and collection pipes between 2022 and 2026. In\naddition, from 2022 to 2026, the Company’s capital investment in treatment plants, storage tanks and other key, above-ground facilities is expected to increase, further addressing infrastructure renewal,\nresiliency, water quality, operational efficiency, technology and innovation, and emerging regulatory compliance needs. Additionally, the Company continues to invest significantly in resiliency projects\nto address the impacts of climate and weather variability by hardening its assets. The benefit of investing in resiliency projects was seen firsthand in the aftermath of Tropical Depression Ida, when the\nCompany’s New Jersey subsidiary reported that all its operating areas successfully withstood widespread flooding and drinking water quality was not impacted in any of its service areas. Specifically,\nthe New Jersey subsidiary’s Raritan-Millstone Water Treatment Plant, which was fortified with a $37 million flood protection project in 2018, withstood a record flood and continued to provide potable\nwater supply for approximately 1 million people in parts of seven counties in central New Jersey.\nRegulation and Rate Making\nThe operations of the Company’s Regulated Businesses are generally subject to regulation by PUCs in the states in which they operate, with the primary responsibility of the PUCs being the\npromotion of the overall public interest by balancing the interest of customers and utility investors.

Bulk contracts, which are accounted for as a single customer in the table above, generally result in service to multiple\ncustomers.\nCustomer growth in the Company’s Regulated Businesses is primarily from (i) adding new customers to its customer base through acquisitions of water and/or wastewater utility systems, (ii)\npopulation growth in its authorized service areas, and (iii) sale of water to other water utilities and community water systems.\n6\n\n\nTable of Contents\nCapital Investment\nThe Company plans to invest between $28 billion and $32 billion over the next 10 years for capital improvements, including acquisitions, to its Regulated Businesses’ water and wastewater\ninfrastructure, largely for pipe replacement and upgrading aging water and wastewater treatment facilities. The Company has proactively improved its pipe renewal rate from a 250-year replacement\ncycle in 2009 to an expected 110-year replacement cycle by 2026, which it anticipates will enable the Company to replace nearly 2,200 miles of mains and collection pipes between 2022 and 2026. In\naddition, from 2022 to 2026, the Company’s capital investment in treatment plants, storage tanks and other key, above-ground facilities is expected to increase, further addressing infrastructure renewal,\nresiliency, water quality, operational efficiency, technology and innovation, and emerging regulatory compliance needs. Additionally, the Company continues to invest significantly in resiliency projects\nto address the impacts of climate and weather variability by hardening its assets. The benefit of investing in resiliency projects was seen firsthand in the aftermath of Tropical Depression Ida, when the\nCompany’s New Jersey subsidiary reported that all its operating areas successfully withstood widespread flooding and drinking water quality was not impacted in any of its service areas. Specifically,\nthe New Jersey subsidiary’s Raritan-Millstone Water Treatment Plant, which was fortified with a $37 million flood protection project in 2018, withstood a record flood and continued to provide potable\nwater supply for approximately 1 million people in parts of seven counties in central New Jersey.\nRegulation and Rate Making\nThe operations of the Company’s Regulated Businesses are generally subject to regulation by PUCs in the states in which they operate, with the primary responsibility of the PUCs being the\npromotion of the overall public interest by balancing the interest of customers and utility investors.

The  Company  supports  full  optionality  for  municipalities,  including  state\nlegislation that enables the consolidation of the largely fragmented water and wastewater industries through third-party fair market valuations of purchased property. Fair market value assessment of\nwater and wastewater systems is an alternative to the traditional depreciated original cost method of valuation, which allows the Company to offer municipalities a purchase price for their system assets\nthat is reflective of the assets’ fair market value, while providing the Company with increased opportunity to recover the purchase price over the life of the purchased system assets, subject to PUC\napproval. In 2021, the Tennessee Public Utilities Commission implemented acquisition valuation rules that create a mechanism to value water and wastewater assets based upon replacement cost new\nless depreciation.\nConsolidated tariffs use a unified rate structure for systems owned and operated by a single utility, which may or may not be physically interconnected. Consolidated tariff pricing moderates the\nimpact of periodic fluctuations in local costs and promotes a more universal water infrastructure investment in a state. As a result, consolidated tariffs can make it easier to incorporate new systems into\nan existing utility, support economies of scale for even the smallest of systems and prioritize capital needs across the state. Overall, the Company believes that consolidated tariffs bring cost-effective,\nhigh-quality services to a larger number of customers. Eleven of the Company’s regulated jurisdictions currently have some form of consolidated tariff pricing, including California, Illinois, Indiana,\nIowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia.\nCompetition\nThe Company’s Regulated Businesses generally do not face direct competition in their existing markets because (i) the Company operates in those markets pursuant to franchises, charters,\ncertificates of public convenience and necessity or similar authorizations (collectively, “CPCNs”) issued by state PUCs or other authorities, and (ii) the high cost of constructing a new water and\nwastewater system in an existing market creates a significant barrier to market entry.

An example of the Company’s use of long-term planning to ensure\nthat it has adequate water supply is its involvement in the Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project (the “Water Supply Project”) in California. The Water Supply Project includes the construction of a\ndesalination plant, to be owned by the Company’s California subsidiary, and the construction of wells that would supply water to the desalination plant. In addition, the Water Supply Project also\nincludes the California subsidiary’s purchase of water from a groundwater replenishment project (the “GWR Project”) between Monterey One Water (formerly known as the Monterey Regional Water\nPollution Control Agency) and the MPWMD. The Water Supply Project is intended, among other things, to fulfill obligations of the California subsidiary to eliminate unauthorized diversions from the\nCarmel River as required under orders of the California State Water Resources Control Board (the “SWRCB”). For more information, see Item 3—Legal Proceedings—Alternative Water Supply in Lieu\nof Carmel River Diversions and Note 17—Commitments and Contingencies—Contingencies—Alternative Water Supply in Lieu of Carmel River Diversions, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements.\nWastewater services involve the collection of wastewater from customers’ premises through sewer lines. The wastewater is then transported through a sewer network to a treatment facility, where\nit is treated to meet required regulatory standards for wastewater before being returned to the environment. The solid waste by-product of the treatment process is disposed of or recycled in accordance\nwith applicable standards and regulations.\nSeasonality\nCustomer demand for the Company’s water service is affected by weather and tends to vary with temperature and amount and frequency of rainfall. Customer demand is generally greater during\nthe warmer months, primarily due to increased water usage for irrigation systems and other outdoor water use. As such, the Company typically expects its operating revenues to be the highest in the third\nquarter of each year. Weather that is hotter and/or drier than average generally increases operating revenues, whereas, weather that is cooler and/or wetter than average generally serves to suppress\ncustomer water demand and can reduce water operating revenues. Two of the Company’s jurisdictions, California and Illinois, have adopted revenue stability mechanisms which permit the Company to\ncollect state PUC-authorized revenue for a given period which is not tied to the volume of water sold during that period, thereby lessening the impact of weather variability. See Regulated Businesses—\nRegulation and Rate Making for additional information regarding revenue stability mechanisms.\nMarket-Based Businesses\nThe Company’s Market-Based Businesses provide water and wastewater services to the U.S. government on military installations, as well as municipalities, and utility customers, and previous",

An example of the Company’s use of long-term planning to ensure\nthat it has adequate water supply is its involvement in the Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project (the “Water Supply Project”) in California. The Water Supply Project includes the construction of a\ndesalination plant, to be owned by the Company’s California subsidiary, and the construction of wells that would supply water to the desalination plant. In addition, the Water Supply Project also\nincludes the California subsidiary’s purchase of water from a groundwater replenishment project (the “GWR Project”) between Monterey One Water (formerly known as the Monterey Regional Water\nPollution Control Agency) and the MPWMD. The Water Supply Project is intended, among other things, to fulfill obligations of the California subsidiary to eliminate unauthorized diversions from the\nCarmel River as required under orders of the California State Water Resources Control Board (the “SWRCB”). For more information, see Item 3—Legal Proceedings—Alternative Water Supply in Lieu\nof Carmel River Diversions and Note 17—Commitments and Contingencies—Contingencies—Alternative Water Supply in Lieu of Carmel River Diversions, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements.\nWastewater services involve the collection of wastewater from customers’ premises through sewer lines. The wastewater is then transported through a sewer network to a treatment facility, where\nit is treated to meet required regulatory standards for wastewater before being returned to the environment. The solid waste by-product of the treatment process is disposed of or recycled in accordance\nwith applicable standards and regulations.\nSeasonality\nCustomer demand for the Company’s water service is affected by weather and tends to vary with temperature and amount and frequency of rainfall. Customer demand is generally greater during\nthe warmer months, primarily due to increased water usage for irrigation systems and other outdoor water use. As such, the Company typically expects its operating revenues to be the highest in the third\nquarter of each year. Weather that is hotter and/or drier than average generally increases operating revenues, whereas, weather that is cooler and/or wetter than average generally serves to suppress\ncustomer water demand and can reduce water operating revenues. Two of the Company’s jurisdictions, California and Illinois, have adopted revenue stability mechanisms which permit the Company to\ncollect state PUC-authorized revenue for a given period which is not tied to the volume of water sold during that period, thereby lessening the impact of weather variability. See Regulated Businesses—\nRegulation and Rate Making for additional information regarding revenue stability mechanisms.\nMarket-Based Businesses\nThe Company’s Market-Based Businesses provide water and wastewater services to the U.S. government on military installations, as well as municipalities, and utility customers, and previous",

The Company participates in the Partnership for Safe Water, the EPA’s voluntary\nprogram to meet more stringent goals for reducing microbial contaminants. With 67 of the Company’s surface water treatment plants receiving the EPA program’s prestigious “Director” award, which\nrecognizes utilities that (i) have completed a comprehensive self-assessment report, (ii) created an action plan for continuous improvement, and (iii) produced high-quality drinking water, the Company\naccounts for approximately one-third of the plants receiving such awards nationwide. In addition, 66 of the Company’s surface water treatment plants have received the “Five-Year Phase III” award, 62\nplants have received the “Ten-Year Phase III” award, 57 plants have received the “Fifteen-Year Phase III” award, and 39 plants have received the “Twenty-Year Phase III” award; these awards\nrecognize plants that have met the Director award status for five, 10, 15 and 20 years, respectively. Further, nine of the Company’s surface water plants have received the “Presidents” award, which\nrecognizes treatment plants that achieve the Partnership’s rigorous individual filter effluent turbidity standards and have maintained this status for at least five years.\nAlthough it is difficult to project the ultimate costs of complying with the above or other pending or future requirements, the Company expects current cost requirements under the Safe Drinki",

Such remediation costs may not be covered by insurance and may make it difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future.\nAttention is being given to contaminants of emerging concern, including, without limitation, chemicals and other substances that currently do not have any regulatory standard in drinking water or\nhave been recently created or discovered (including by means of scientific achievements in the analysis and detection of trace amounts of substances). Examples of sources of contaminants include, but\nare not limited to, newly created chemical compounds (including, for example, manufactured nanomaterials); human and veterinary products; perfluorinated and polyfluorinated compounds; bacteria,\nmicrobes, viruses (including the coronavirus), amoebae and other pathogens; and residual by-products of disinfection. We rely upon governmental agencies to set appropriate regulatory standards to\nprotect the public from these and other contaminants, and our role is to provide service that meets these standards, if any. In some of our states, PUCs may disapprove of cost recovery, in whole or in\npart, for implementation of treatment infrastructure for a contaminant in the absence of a regulatory standard. Furthermore, given the rapid pace at which these contaminants are being created and/or\ndiscovered, we may not be able to detect and/or mitigate all such substances in our drinking water system or supplies, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of\noperations and reputation. In addition, we believe these contaminants may form the basis for additional or increased federal or state regulatory initiatives and requirements in the future, which could\nsignificantly increase the cost of our operations.\nLimitations on availability of water supplies or restrictions on our use of water supplies as a result of government regulation or action may adversely affect our access to sources of water, our ability\nto supply water to customers or the demand for our water services.\n",

We use technology systems to,\namong other things, bill customers, process orders, provide customer service, manage certain plant operations and construction projects, manage our financial records, track assets, remotely monitor our\nplants and facilities, and manage human resources, supply chain, inventory, and accounts receivable collections. As a specific example, we depend on water meters to record and communicate the\namount of water our customers use, and in recent years, we have experienced greater than expected performance failures with certain water meters used in the Regulated Businesses. When these occur,\nwe work with meter manufacturers to determine and address the cause of such failures. While these and other failures that we have experienced have not to date had a material adverse effect on our\noperations, there can be no assurance that efforts to address performance failures or other issues we may experience with water meters will be successful and that these or future failures of water meters\nor other issues will not have a material adverse effect on us.\nAlthough we do not believe that the technology we have implemented or may in the future implement is at a materially greater risk of failure than that used by other similar organizations, our\ntechnology and operations that use or rely on technology remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from, among other things: failure or interruption of the technology or its related systems; loss or\nfailure of power, internet, telecommunications or data network systems; and operator error or improper operation by, the negligent or improper supervision of, or the intentional acts of, employees,\ncontractors and other third parties. Any or all of these events could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nAn inability to successfully develop and implement new technologies poses substantial risks to our business and operational excellence strategies, which could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness and financial results.\nA significant part of our long-term strategic focus on safety, operational excellence, O&M expense efficiency, water quality, asset and capital management and the customer experience includes\nimplementing  new  technologies  for,  among  other  things:  customer  service  and  support;  environmental  compliance;  water  metering;  water  quality  and  source  monitoring;  cybersecurity;  business\ndevelopment and growth; data analysis; employee development and training; and other initiatives.

However, these efforts may not be effective to fully mitigate interest rate risk, and may expose us to other risks\nand uncertainties, including quarterly “mark to market” valuation risk associated with these instruments, that could negatively and materially affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash\nflows.\nOur ability to pay our expenses and satisfy our debt service obligations depends in significant part on our future performance, which will be affected by the financial, business, economic,\ncompetitive, legislative (including tax initiatives and reforms, and other similar legislation or regulation), regulatory and other risk factors described in this section, many of which are beyond our\ncontrol. If we do not have sufficient cash flows to pay the principal and interest on our outstanding debt, we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt, reduce capital investments, sell\nassets, borrow additional funds or sell additional equity. In addition, if our business does not generate sufficient cash flows from operations, or if we are unable to incur indebtedness sufficient to enable\nus to fund our liquidity needs, we may be unable to plan for or respond to changes in our business, which could cause our financial condition, operating results and prospects to be affected materially and\nadversely.\n37\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOur inability to access the debt or equity capital or financial markets or other events could affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs at reasonable cost and our ability to meet long-term\ncommitments, which co",

In April 2018, the City filed a notice to become the GSA for the CEMEX site, creating an overlap with the SVBGSA’s filing for the 180/400 Subbasin. In 2016, the SVBGSA\ncommenced preparation of a GSP covering the entire 180/400 subbasin, including the CEMEX site, but in August 2019 the City filed a notice that it intends to prepare its own GSP for the CEMEX site\nwith the intent to severely limit or prohibit groundwater pumping at that site. The State Department of Water Resources (“SDWR”) has taken the position that until the overlap is resolved, it will not\naccept the GSP from either agency, placing the subbasin at risk of being placed in a probationary status and subject to state management. In December 2019, the County of Monterey filed its own notice\nto become the exclusive GSA at the CEMEX site in order to resolve the overlap, which is permitted under SGMA. SDWR accepted Monterey County’s filing on December 18, 2019, and now lists\nMonterey County as the exclusive GSA for the site.\n45\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOn December 30, 2019, the City filed a lawsuit in Monterey County Superior Court challenging Monterey County’s filing, and SDWR’s acceptance of the filing, as the exclusive GSA for the\nCEMEX site. The City has named Monterey County and its Board of Supervisors, its GSA, and SDWR and its director as defendants, and the SVBGSA and its Board of Directors as real parties. The\nCity seeks to invalidate Monterey County’s filing, as well as injunctive relief to preserve the City’s status as a GSA for the site.

These increases were offset by an\nestimated net decrease of $13 million from weather in both 2021 and 2020, a $5 million decrease from lower water services demand and ongoing customer usage reductions from conservation, and a $79\nmillion decrease in revenues due to the amortization of EADIT, which is generally offset with a reduction in income tax expense. Additionally, there was an $8 million decrease in revenue due to the\ndenial of authorization to defer certain COVID-19 financial impacts based on the PaPUC order received by the Company’s Pennsylvania subsidiary.

In order to meet short-term liquidity needs, AWCC issues commercial paper that is supported by its revolving credit facility. The Company may\nalso access the equity capital markets to support its capital funding requirements, as needed. The Company’s access to external financing on reasonable terms depends on its credit ratings and current\nbusiness conditions, including that of the utility and water utility industry in general, as well as conditions in the debt or equity capital  markets, and the national and international economic and\ngeopolitical arenas. Disruptions in the credit markets may discourage lenders from extending the terms of such commitments or agreeing to new commitments. Market disruptions may also limit the\nCompany’s ability to issue debt and equity securities in the capital markets.\nIf these unfavorable business, market, financial and other conditions deteriorate to the extent that the Company is no longer able to access the commercial paper and/or capital markets on\nreasonable terms, AWCC has access to an unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in March 2025 with aggregate bank commitments of $2.25 billion. The facility is used principally to fulfill the\nCompany’s short-term liquidity needs by supporting AWCC’s $2.10 billion commercial paper program and to provide a sublimit of up to $150 million for letters of credit. Subject to satisfying certain\nconditions, the credit agreement permits AWCC to increase the maximum commitment under the facility by up to $500 million. As of December 31, 2021, AWCC had no outstanding borrowings and\n$76 million of outstanding letters of credit under its revolving credit facility, with $1.59 billion available to fulfill its short-term liquidity needs and to issue letters of credit.\nTo ensure adequate liquidity given the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on debt and capital markets, on March 20, 2020, AWCC entered into a Term Loan Credit Agreement, by and among\nparent company, AWCC and the lenders party thereto (the “Term Loan Facility”). The net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes of AWCC and American Water and to provide additional\nliquidity.

In order to meet short-term liquidity needs, AWCC issues commercial paper that is supported by its revolving credit facility. The Company may\nalso access the equity capital markets to support its capital funding requirements, as needed. The Company’s access to external financing on reasonable terms depends on its credit ratings and current\nbusiness conditions, including that of the utility and water utility industry in general, as well as conditions in the debt or equity capital  markets, and the national and international economic and\ngeopolitical arenas. Disruptions in the credit markets may discourage lenders from extending the terms of such commitments or agreeing to new commitments. Market disruptions may also limit the\nCompany’s ability to issue debt and equity securities in the capital markets.\nIf these unfavorable business, market, financial and other conditions deteriorate to the extent that the Company is no longer able to access the commercial paper and/or capital markets on\nreasonable terms, AWCC has access to an unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in March 2025 with aggregate bank commitments of $2.25 billion. The facility is used principally to fulfill the\nCompany’s short-term liquidity needs by supporting AWCC’s $2.10 billion commercial paper program and to provide a sublimit of up to $150 million for letters of credit. Subject to satisfying certain\nconditions, the credit agreement permits AWCC to increase the maximum commitment under the facility by up to $500 million. As of December 31, 2021, AWCC had no outstanding borrowings and\n$76 million of outstanding letters of credit under its revolving credit facility, with $1.59 billion available to fulfill its short-term liquidity needs and to issue letters of credit.\nTo ensure adequate liquidity given the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on debt and capital markets, on March 20, 2020, AWCC entered into a Term Loan Credit Agreement, by and among\nparent company, AWCC and the lenders party thereto (the “Term Loan Facility”). The net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes of AWCC and American Water and to provide additional\nliquidity.

AWCC used the net proceeds of this offering: (i) to lend funds to parent company and its regulated subsidiaries; (ii) to prepay $251 million aggregate principal\namount of AWCC’s outstanding 5.77% Series D Senior Notes due December 21, 2021 (the “Series D Notes”) and $76 million aggregate principal amount of AWCC’s outstanding 6.55% Series H Senior\nNotes due May 15, 2023 (the “Series H Notes,” and together with the Series D Notes, the “Series Notes”); (iii) to repay AWCC’s commercial paper obligations; and (iv) for general corporate purposes.\nAfter the prepayments described above, none of the Series D Notes, and approximately $14 million aggregate principal amount of the Series H Notes, remain outstanding. As a result of AWCC’s\nprepayment of the Series Notes, a make-whole premium of $15 million was paid to the holders thereof on June 14, 2021. Substantially all of the early debt extinguishment costs were allocable to the\nCompany’s utility subsidiaries and recorded as regulatory assets, as the Company believes they are probable of recovery in future rates.\nOne of the principal market risks to which the Company is exposed is changes in interest rates. In order to manage the exposure, the Company follows risk management policies and procedures,\nincluding the use of derivative contracts such as swaps. The Company also reduces exposure to interest rates by managing commercial paper and debt maturities. The Company does not enter into\nderivative contracts (through AWCC) for speculative purposes and does not use leveraged instruments. The derivative contracts entered into are for periods consistent with the related underlying\nexposures. The Company is exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual",

In addition, there can be no\nassurances that regulators will grant sufficient rate authorizations. Therefore, the Company’s ability to fully recover operating expense, recover its investment and provide an appropriate return on\ninvested capital made in the Regulated Businesses may be adversely impacted.\n78\n\n\nTable of Contents\nITEM 8.

The Company assesses\nqualitative factors to determine whether quantitative testing is necessary. If it is determined, based upon qualitative factors, that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not, greater\nthan its carrying value, no further testing is required. If the Company bypasses the qualitative assessment or performs the qualitative assessment and determines that the estimated fair value of a reporting\nunit is more likely than not, less than its carrying value, a quantitative, fair value-based assessment is performed. This quantitative testing compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its\nrespective net carrying value, including goodwill, on the measurement date. An impairment loss will be recognized in the amount equal to the excess of the reporting unit’s carrying value compared to its\nestimated fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nApplication of goodwill impairment testing requires management judgment, including the identification of reporting units and determining the fair value of reporting units. Management estimates\nfair value using a discounted cash flow analysis. Significant assumptions used in these fair value estimations include, but are not limited to, forecasts of future operating results, discount and growth\nrates.\nThe Company believes the assumptions and other considerations used to value goodwill to be appropriate, however, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and considerations used in its\nanalysis, the resulting change could have a material adverse impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

          "chunk": "\nThe Company’s annual impairment testing is performed as of November 30 of each year, in conjunction with the completion of the Company’s annual business plan. The Company assesses\nqualitative factors to determine whether quantitative testing is necessary. If it is determined, based upon qualitative factors, that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not, greater\nthan its carrying value, no further testing is required. If the Company bypasses the qualitative assessment or performs the qualitative assessment and determines that the estimated fair value of a reporting\nunit is more likely than not, less than its carrying value, a quantitative, fair value-based assessment is performed. This quantitative testing compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its\nrespective net carrying value, including goodwill, on the measurement date. An impairment loss will be recognized in the amount equal to the excess of the reporting unit’s carrying value compared to its\nestimated fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nApplication of goodwill impairment testing requires management judgment, including the identification of reporting units and determining the fair value of reporting units. Management estimates\nfair value using a discounted cash flow analysis. Significant assumptions used in these fair value estimations include, but are not limited to, forecasts of future operating results, discount and growth\nrates.\nThe Company believes the assumptions and other considerations used to value goodwill to be appropriate, however, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and considerations used in its\nanalysis, the resulting change could have a material adverse impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Defined benefit plans with a funding status of less than 80% of the current liability are defined as being “at risk” and additional funding requirements and benefit restrictions may apply.

The water main is part of the West Relay pumping station located in\nthe City of Dunbar, West Virginia and owned by WVAWC. The failure of the main caused water outages and low pressure for up to approximately 25,000 WVAWC customers.

The Bylaws prohibit the conduct of any business at a special meeting other than as\nspecified in the notice for such meeting.\nThe Bylaws establish advance notice procedures with respect to shareholder proposals for annual meetings and the nomination of candidates for election as directors, other than nominations made\nby or at the direction of the Board or a committee thereof.

The threshold for a change in control is a fact-specific inquiry that varies by state.

However, the operating income is not explicitly stated. Therefore, we can infer the operating income by subtracting the 'Provision for income taxes' from the 'Income before income taxes'.\n   Citation: For the Years Ended December 31, 2021 Income before income taxes $798 Provision for income taxes 248\n\n### Chunk # 104\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`208`):\n   Answer: None\n   Explanation: The provided text does not explicitly mention the operating income for FY2021.

      "output": "### Analysis\n\n1. **Information Gathered:**\n   - **Operating Income:** Several chunks mention operating income figures, but there is inconsistency. The most reliable figures seem to be $1,196 million and $1,263 million, both cited from different sections of the financial statements.\n   - **Depreciation and Amortization:** The most consistent figure for depreciation and amortization is $636 million, which appears multiple times and is cited from the 'Operating expenses' table.\n\n2. **Sufficiency of Information:**\n   - We have gathered potential figures for both operating income and depreciation and amortization. However, there are conflicting numbers for operating income, which need resolution.\n\n3. **Missing Information:**\n   - We need to resolve the conflicting operating income figures. The $1,196 million figure is cited from the 'Operating income' section, while $1,263 million is mentioned in the context of net income, which might not be directly comparable.\n\n4. **Calculation:**\n   - Assuming $1,196 million is the correct operating income (as it is directly cited from the 'Operating income' section), and $636 million is the depreciation and amortization, the unadjusted EBITDA would be calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Unadjusted EBITDA} = 1,196 + 636 = 1,832 \\text{ million USD}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Conflicting Answers:**\n   - The $1,263 million figure seems to be related to net income rather than operating income, which is not directly comparable. The $1,196 million figure is more reliable for operating income as it is directly cited from the 'Operating income' section.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, the most reliable calculation for American Water Works's FY2021 unadjusted EBITDA is $1,832 million USD, using $1,196 million for operating income and $636 million for depreciation and amortization."
