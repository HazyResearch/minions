Answer in units of percents and round to one decimal place.\n\n---\n\nPlease provide succinct advice on the critical information we need to extract from the Financial document. Total length: 449468 characters to answer this question. \n\nAlso consider the following constraints:\n- In your response do NOT use numbered lists.\n- Do NOT structure your response as a sequence of steps.\n",
      "output": "To determine the change in unadjusted operating income percentage margin for Walmart from FY2018 to FY2019, focus on extracting specific financial data from the statement of income. Key information includes the operating income figures and total revenue for both fiscal years. The operating income percentage margin is calculated by dividing the operating income by the total revenue and then multiplying by 100 to convert it to a percentage. Identify these figures for both FY2018 and FY2019, calculate the operating income percentage margins for each year, and then determine the change by subtracting the FY2018 margin from the FY2019 margin. Ensure that all calculations are precise and round the final result to one decimal place to meet the question's requirements."

Instead, you can assign small, isolated tasks to a less capable worker model that sees only a single chunk of text at a time. Any cross-chunk or multi-document reasoning must be handled by you.\n\n## Your Job: Write Two Python Functions\n\n### FUNCTION #1: `prepare_jobs(context, prev_job_manifests, prev_job_outputs) -> List[JobManifest]`\n- Break the document(s) into chunks (using the provided chunking function, if needed). Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 12 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`. All **multi-chunk integration** or **global reasoning** is your responsibility here.\n- Return one **aggregated string** suitable for further supervisor inspection.\n\n\n\n## Relevant Pydantic Models\n\nThe following models are already in the global scope. **Do NOT redefine or re-import them.**\n\n### JobManifest Model\n```\nclass JobManifest(BaseModel):\n    chunk: str  # the actual text for the chunk of the document\n    task: str  # the actual task instruction for the small model\n    advice: str  # optional, any additional advice on how to perform the task\n\n    chunk_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    task_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    job_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n\n```\n\n### JobOutput Model\n```\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    citation: Optional[str]\n    answer: Optional[str]\n\n```\n\n## Function Signatures\n```\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        context (List[str]): A list of documents.

Our consolidated financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, and to prepare\nthose financial statements we must translate the amounts of the assets, liabilities, net sales, other revenues and expenses of our operations outside of the U.S. from local currencies into U.S. dollars using\nexchange rates for the current period. In recent years, fluctuations in currency exchange rates that were unfavorable have had adverse effects on our reported results of operations.\nAs a result of such translations, fluctuations in currency exchange rates from period-to-period that are unfavorable to us may also result in our consolidated financial statements reflecting significant\nadverse period-over-period changes in our financial performance or reflecting a period-over-period improvement in our financial performance that is not as robust as it would be without such\nfluctuations in the currency exchange rates. Such unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations will adversely affect the reported performance of our Walmart International operating segment and\nhave a corresponding adverse effect on our reported consolidated results of operations.\nWe may pay for products we purchase for sale in our stores and clubs around the world with a currency other than the local currency of the country in which the goods will be sold. When we must\nacquire the currency to pay for such products and the exchange rates for the payment currency fluctuate in a manner unfavorable to us, our cost of sales may increase and we may be unable or",

We also discuss certain performance metrics that\nmanagement uses to assess the Company's performance. Additionally, the discussion provides information about the financial results of each of the three segments to provide a better understanding of\nhow each of those segments and its results of operations affect the financial condition and results of operations of the Company as a whole.\nManagement measures the results of the Company's segments using each segment's operating income, including certain corporate overhead allocations, as well as other measures. From time to time, we\nrevise the measurement of each segment's operating income and other measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker. In fiscal 2019, the Company\nrevised certain of its corporate overhead allocations, including depreciation expense, to the operating segments and, accordingly, revised prior period amounts for comparability .\nManagement also measures the results of comparable store and club sales, or comparable sales, a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales\nfor such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period from the corresponding period in the previous year. Walmart's definition of comparable sales includes sales from stores and\nclubs open for the previous 12 months, including remodels, relocations, expansions and conversions, as well as eCommerce sales. We measure the eCommerce sales impact by including all sales\ninitiated online or though mobile applications, including omni-channel transactions which are fulfilled through our stores and clubs. Sales at a store that has changed in format are excluded from\ncomparable sales when the conversion of that store is accompanied by a relocation or expansion that results in a change in the store's retail square feet of more than five percent.

As of January 31, 2019 and 2018 , our inventories valued at LIFO\napproximated those inventories as if they were valued at FIFO.\nImpairment of Assets\nWe evaluate long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable.

          "chunk": "al Statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Those principles require management to make estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. Management's estimates and assumptions also affect the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and\nthe reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers investments with a maturity when purchased of three months or less to be cash equivalents. All credit card, debit card and electronic transfer transactions that process in less than\nseven days are classified as cash and cash equivalents.

The fair value of a liability is the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor in a\ntransaction between such parties, not the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor.\nSelf Insurance Reserves\nThe Company self-insures a number of risks, including, but not limited to, workers' compensation, general liability, auto liability, product liability and certain employee-related healthcare benefits .\nStandard actuarial procedures and data analysis are used to estimate the liabilities associated with these risks as of the balance sheet date on an undiscounted basis. The recorded liabilities reflect the\nultimate cost for claims incurred but not paid and any estimable administrative run-out expenses related to the processing of these outstanding claim payments. On a regular basis, the liabilities are\nevaluated for appropriateness with claims reserve valuations. To limit exposure to some risks, the Company maintains insurance coverage with varying limits and retentions, including stop-loss\ninsurance coverage for workers' compensation, general liability and auto liability.\nDerivatives\nThe Company uses derivatives for hedging purposes to manage its exposure to changes in interest and currency exchange rates, as well as to maintain an appropriate mix of fixed- and",

GENERAL 1.1 Purpose. The purpose of the Walmart Deferred Compensation Matching Plan is to enable certain individuals to defer compensation and to be credited with matching allocations and earnings. The Plan is intended to reward such individuals for their contributions to the success of Walmart and its Related Affiliates. The Plan is also intended to assist such individuals in saving for retirement by providing benefits that are in excess of benefits permitted by applicable law under the 401(k) Plan. 1.2 Effective Date. The effective date of the amended and restated Plan is February 1, 2019. 1.3 Nature of Plan. The Plan is intended to be (and shall be administered as) an unfunded employee pension plan benefiting a select group of management or highly compensated employees under the provisions of ERISA. The Plan shall be “unfunded” for tax purposes and for purposes of Title I of ERISA. Any and all payments under the Plan shall be made solely from the general assets of Walmart. A Participant’s interests under the Plan do not represent or create a claim against specific assets of Walmart or any Employer. Nothing herein shall be deemed to create a trust of any kind or create any fiduciary relationship between the Committee, Walmart or any Employer and a Participant, the Participant’s beneficiary or any other person. To the extent any person acquires a right to receive payments from Walmart under this Plan, such right is no greater than the right of any other unsecured general creditor of Walmart. The Plan is intended to be in compliance with Code Section 409A and shall be interpreted, applied and administered at all times in accordance with Code Section 409A and guidance issued thereunder.

Total revenue for FY2019: $510,329 million. None The operating income for FY2019 is $21,957 million. However, the total revenue for FY2019 is not explicitly mentioned in the provided excerpt. We can infer that the total revenue is the sum of operating income, interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent, which is $35,856 million. However, this is not the total revenue, but rather the adjusted operating income. To find the total revenue, we need to look at the 'Certain Balance Sheet Data' section, but the total revenue is not explicitly mentioned there either. Therefore, we cannot accurately determine the total revenue for FY2019 based on the provided information. None $21,957 $514,405 Unfortunately, the exact operating income and total revenue for FY2019 are not provided in the snippet. However, we can infer that the total revenue is the net sales, and the operating income can be calculated by subtracting the operating expenses from the net sales. The net sales for FY2019 are not explicitly stated, but we can try to find the figure in the text. The text mentions that the operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 48 basis points, which implies that the net sales increased. However, the exact figure is not provided. We can also see that the other losses were $8.4 billion for fiscal 2019, but this is not the operating income. We can also see that the membership and other income decreased for fiscal 2019, but this is not the operating income either. We can also see that the operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 48 basis points, which implies that the operating expenses decreased, but we do not have the exact figure. We can also see that the company recognized a $160 million charge related to a securities class action lawsuit, but this is not the operating income. Unfortunately, we cannot provide the exact operating income and total revenue for FY2019 based on the provided text. $331,666 million in total revenue and $17,386 million in operating income for FY2019. $120,824 million in total revenue and $4,883 million in operating income for FY2019. $57,839 million (net sales), $1,520 million (operating income) The operating income for FY2019 is $605 million. The total revenue for FY2019 is not explicitly stated, but it can be inferred that the total revenue is the sum of segment net sales, which is not provided in the given excerpt. However, we can find the comparable sales for FY2018, which positively contributed approximately 0.7% to comparable sales. Unfortunately, we cannot find the total revenue for FY2019 in the given excerpt. None None None None None None None None None None None 1,003 million, 514,405 million None To calculate the total revenue for FY2019, we need more information from the 'Consolidated Statements of Income' section. However, we can calculate the operating income by using the following formula: Operating Income = Consolidated net income - Depreciation and amortization - (Gains) and losses for disposal of business operations - Loss on extinguishment of debt - Other operating activities. Using the provided data, we get: Operating Income = $7,179 - $10,678 - $4,850 - $0 - $1,734 = -$9,983 million. However, this is not the correct answer as it is a negative number. We need to look at the 'Consolidated Statements of Income' section to get the correct answer. Unfortunately, the provided data does not include the total revenue for FY2019. None None None None None None None Membership fee revenue for FY2019: $1.4 billion. Operating income for FY2019: Not available.

Whether it is sufficient to answer the question\n3. If not sufficient, what specific information is missing\n4. If sufficient, how we would calculate or derive the answer\n5. If there are conflicting answers:\n--> Use citations to select the correct answer if there are conflicting answers.\n\nBe brief and concise. No need for structured output - just think through the steps. You MUST respond in markdown format (for $ signs make sure to use escape character \\ before the $ sign).\n",
      "output": "Based on the collected outputs from the junior models, we have gathered some information about Walmart's financial figures for FY2018 and FY2019. However, the data is fragmented and inconsistent, making it challenging to derive a clear answer.\n\n1. **Information Gathered:**\n   - For FY2018, there is mention of $514.4 billion in net sales, but operating income is not explicitly mentioned.\n   - For FY2019, there are multiple figures mentioned for operating income and total revenue, such as $21,957 million for operating income and $514,405 million for total revenue. However, these figures are not consistently cited across the outputs.\n\n2. **Sufficiency of Information:**\n   - The information is not sufficient to answer the question definitively. The figures for operating income and total revenue are inconsistent and lack clear citations or context to verify their accuracy.\n\n3. **Missing Information:**\n   - We need clear and consistent figures for both operating income and total revenue for FY2018 and FY2019. Specifically, the operating income for FY2018 is missing, and the figures for FY2019 are conflicting.\n\n4. **Calculation of the Answer:**\n   - If we had consistent and accurate figures, we would calculate the operating income percentage margin for each year by dividing the operating income by total revenue and multiplying by 100. The change in margin would be the difference between the FY2019 and FY2018 margins.\n\n5. **Conflicting Answers:**\n   - There are conflicting figures for FY2019's operating income and total revenue. Without clear citations or a reliable source, it is difficult to determine which figures are correct.\n\nIn conclusion, we need more reliable and consistent data, particularly for FY2018's operating income and a verified set of figures for FY2019, to accurately calculate the change in unadjusted operating income percentage margin for Walmart."

In recent years, fluctuations in currency exchange rates that were unfavorable have had adverse effects on our reported results of operations.\nAs a result of such translations, fluctuations in currency exchange rates from period-to-period that are unfavorable to us may also result in our consolidated financial statements reflecting significant\nadverse period-over-period changes in our financial performance or reflecting a period-over-period improvement in our financial performance that is not as robust as it would be without such\nfluctuations in the currency exchange rates. Such unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations will adversely affect the reported performance of our Walmart International operating segment and\nhave a corresponding adverse effect on our reported consolidated results of operations.\nWe may pay for products we purchase for sale in our stores and clubs around the world with a currency other than the local currency of the country in which the goods will be sold.

We measure operating discipline through expense leverage, which we define as net sales growing at a faster rate than\noperating, selling, general and administrative expenses.\nFiscal Years Ended January 31,\n(Amounts in millions, except unit counts)\n2019\n2018\nNet sales\n$\n510,329\n$\n495,761\nPercentage change from comparable period\n2.9%\n3.0%\nOperating, selling, general and administrative expenses\n$\n107,147\n$\n106,510\nPercentage change from comparable period\n0.6%\n4.6%\nOperating, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales\n21.0%\n21.5%\nFor fiscal 2019 , operating, selling, general and administrative (\"operating\") expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 48 basis points, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year.\nThe primary drivers of the expense leverage were strong sales performance in conjunction with productivity improvements and lapping fiscal 2018 charges discussed in the following paragraph . The\nimprovements in fiscal 2019 were partially offset by additional investments in eCommerce and technology, as well as a $160 million charge related to a securities class action lawsuit .\nFor fiscal 2018, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 32 basis points, when compared to the previous fiscal year. While our increase in net sales and improving expense management\nhad a positive impact on our operating expenses as a percentage of net sales, we did not leverage expenses as a result of approximately $0.6 billion in charges related to Sam's Club closures and\ndiscontinued real estate projects, $400 million related to a lump sum bonus paid to associates, $300 million related to Home Office severance, the legal accrual of $283 million related to the FCPA\nmatter, a charge of $244 million related to discontinued real estate projects in Walmart U.S. and the decisions to exit certain international properties and wind down the first party Brazil eCommerce\noperations.\nStrategic Capital Allocation\nWe are allocating more capital to eCommerce, technology, supply chain, and store remodels and less to new store and club openings, when compared to prior years.

Beginning in fiscal 2020, our calculation of ROI will change upon adoption of ASU 2016-02, Leases , primarily to replace the factor of 8 for rent expense\nwith US GAAP operating lease assets.\nThe calculation of ROA and ROI, along with a reconciliation of ROI to the calculation of ROA, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, is as follows:\n \nFiscal Years Ended January 31,\n(Amounts in millions)\n2019\n2018\nCALCULATION OF RETURN ON ASSETS\nNumerator\nConsolidated net income\n$\n7,179\n$\n10,523\nDenominator\nAverage total assets (1)\n$\n211,909\n$\n201,674\nReturn on assets (ROA)\n3.4%\n5.2%\nCALCULATION OF RETURN ON INVESTMENT\nNumerator\nOperating income\n$\n21,957\n$\n20,437\n+ Interest income\n217\n152\n+ Depreciation and amortization\n10,678\n10,529\n+ Rent\n3,004\n2,932\n= Adjusted operating income\n$\n35,856\n$\n34,050\nDenominator\nAverage total assets (1)\n$\n211,909\n$\n201,674\n+ Average accumulated depreciation and amortization (1)\n85,107\n79,995\n- Average accounts payable (1)\n46,576\n43,763\n- Average accrued liabilities (1)\n22,141\n21,388\n+ Rent x 8\n24,032\n23,456\n= Average invested capital\n$\n252,331\n$\n239,974\nReturn on investment (ROI)\n14.2%\n14.2%\n \nAs of January 31,\n \n2019\n2018\n2017\nCertain Balance Sheet Data\nTotal assets\n$\n219,295\n$\n204,522\n$\n198,825\nAccumulated depreciation and amortization\n87,175\n83,039\n76,951\nAccounts payable\n47,060\n46,092\n41,433\nAccrued liabilities\n22,159\n22,122\n20,654\n(1) The average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by 2.\nFree Cash Flow\nFree cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure.

We generally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in funding operations, consistent access to the capital markets and returns provided to our\nshareholders in the form of payments of cash dividends and share repurchases. The decreased working capital deficit as of January 31, 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to higher current assets\nas a result of the consolidation of Flipkart.\nHistorically, we have used intercompany financing arrangements to make cash available in the country in which it is needed with the minimum cost possible. During fiscal 2019, we repatriated to the\nU.S. $5.3 billion of cash at a tax cost of approximately $40 million .\nAs of January 31, 2019 and 2018 , cash and cash equivalents of $2.8 billion and $1.4 billion , respectively, may not be freely transferable to the U.S. due to local laws or other restrictions. Of the $2.8\nbillion as of January 31, 2019 , approximately $1.2 billion can only be accessed through dividends or intercompany financing arrangements subject to approval of the Flipkart minority shareholders;\nhowever, this cash is expected to be utilized to fund the operations of Flipkart.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\n \nFiscal Years Ended January 31,\n(Amounts in millions)\n2019\n2018\n2017\nNet cash used in investing activities\n$\n(24,036)\n$\n(9,079)\n$\n(13,896)\nNet cash used in investing activities was $24.0 billion , $9.1 billion and $13.9 billion for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively, and generally consisted of payments for business acquisitions and to\nexpand our eCommerce capabilities, invest in other techno",

These factors could cause management to conclude that indicators of impairment exist and require impairment tests be performed, which could result in\nmanagement determining the value of long-lived assets is impaired, resulting in a write-down of the related long-lived assets. While fiscal 2019 included a pre-tax loss of $4.8 billion related to the sale\nof the majority stake in Walmart Brazil, which included full impairment of all related-assets, there were no other material impairment charges for fiscal 2019. As a measure of sensitivity, fiscal 2019\nimpairment would not change materially with a 10% decrease in the undiscounted cash flows for the stores or clubs with indicators of impairment. For fiscal 2018, although impairment charges were\n$1.4 billion, these charges primarily related to restructuring activities described in Note 14 , as well as discontinued real estate projects in the U.S. and decisions to exit certain international properties .\nImpairment charges not related to restructuring activities or decisions to exit properties for fiscal 2019 and 2018 were not material.\n41\n\n\nBusiness Combinations, Goodwill, and Acquired Intangible Assets\nWe account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control is obtained, all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including amounts\nattributable to noncontrolling interests, be recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. The determination of fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities requires estimates and the\nuse of valuation techniques when market value is not readily available. For intangible assets acquired in a business combination, we typically use the income method. Significant estimates in valuing\ncertain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, discount rates and useful lives. The excess of the purchase price over fair values of\nidentifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.\nGoodwill is assigned to the reporting unit which consolidates the acquisition. Components within the same reportable segment are aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components have\nsimilar economic characteristics. As of January 31, 2019 , our reporting units consisted of Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. Goodwill and other indefinite-lived acquired intangible\nassets are not amortized, but are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of a certain asset may be impaired. Generally, this evaluation\nbegins with a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative impairment test is necessary. If we determine, after performing an assessment based on the qua",

In reality, however, a change in one factor could cause a change in another, which may\nmagnify or negate other sensitivities.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our short-term borrowings and long-term debt. We hedge a portion of our interest rate risk by managing the mix of fixed and variable rate debt\nand by entering into interest rate swaps. For fiscal 2019 , the net fair value of our interest rate swaps increased   $13 million primarily due to fluctuations in market interest rates.\nThe table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For long-term debt, the table represents the principal cash flows and related weighted-\naverage interest rates by expected maturity dates. For interest rate swaps, the table represents t",

The Company estimates the expected lease term by assuming the exercise of renewal options where an\neconomic penalty exists that would preclude the abandonment of the lease at the end of the initial non-cancelable term and the exercise of such renewal is at the sole discretion of the Company. The\nexpected lease term is used in the determination of whether a store or club lease is a capital or operating lease and in the calculation of straight-line rent expense. Additionally, the useful life of leasehold\nimprovements is limited by the expected lease term or the economic life of the asset, whichever is shorter. If significant expenditures are made for leasehold improvements late in the expected lease term\nand renewal is reasonably assured, the useful life of the leasehold improvement is limited to the end of the renewal period or economic life of the asset, whichever is shorter. Rent abatements and\nescalations are considered in the calculation of minimum lease payments in the Company's capital lease tests and in determining straight-line rent expense for operating leases.\n54\n\n\nThe Company is often involved in the construction of its leased stores. In certain cases, payments made for certain structural components included in the lessor's construction of the leased assets result in\nthe Company being deemed the owner of the leased assets for accounting purposes. As a result, the payments, regardless of the significance, are automatic indicators of ownership and require the\nCompany to capitalize the lessor's total project cost with a corresponding financing obligation. Upon completion of the lessor's project, the Company performs a sale-leaseback analysis to determine if\nthese assets and the related financing obligation can be derecognized from the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. If the Company is deemed to have \"continuing involvement,\" the leased assets\nand the related financing obligation remain on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets and are generally amortized over the lease term. At the end of the lease term, including exercise of any\nrenewal options, the net remaining financing obligation over the net carrying value of the fixed asset will be recognized as a non-cash gain.\nLong-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets are initially recorded at cost. Management reviews long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may\nnot be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is at the individual store or club level. Undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the\nrelated assets are estimated over the assets' useful lives based o",

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the\nfinancial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases (\"temporary differences\"). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in\neffect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in income in the\nperiod that includes the enactment date.\nDeferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that a portion is not more likely than not to be realized. Many factors are considered when\nassessing whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, including recent cumulative earnings, expectations of future taxable income, carryforward periods, and other\nrelevant quantitative and qualitative factors. The recoverability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of\ntaxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies.

Management estimates\nunredeemed balances and recognizes revenue for these amounts in membership and other income in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income over the expected redemption period.\nManagement periodically reviews and updates its estimates.\nFinancial and Other Services\nThe Company recognizes revenue from service transactions at the time the service is performed. Generally, revenue from services is classified as a component of net sales in the Company's Condensed\nConsolidated Statements of Income.\nContract Balances\nContract balances as a result of transactions with customers primarily consist of receivables included in receivables, net, and deferred gift card revenue included in accrued liabilities in the Company's\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Cost of sales is reduced by supplier payments that are not a\nreimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs.\nPayments from Suppliers\nThe Company receives consideration from suppliers for various programs, primarily volume incentives, warehouse allowances and reimbursements for specific programs such as markdowns, margin\nprotection, advertising and supplier-specific fixtures. Payments from suppliers are accounted for as a reduction of cost of sales, except in certain limited situations when the payment is a reimbursement\nof specific, incremental and identifiable costs, and are recognized in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income when the related inventory is sold.\nOperating, Selling, General and Administrative Expenses\nOperating, selling, general and administrative expenses include all operating costs of the Company, except cost of sales, as described above. As a result, the majority of the cost of warehousing and\noccupancy for the Walmart U.S. and Walmart International segments' distribution facilities is included in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses. Because the Company only includes a\nportion of the cost of its Walmart U.S. and Walmart International segments' distribution facilities in cost of sales, its gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of net sales may not be comparable to\nthose of other retailers that may include all costs related to their distribution facilities in cost of sales and in the calculation of gross profit.\nAdvertising Costs\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred, consist",

To the extent the Company does not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset\nwill be recovered, a valuation allowance is established. To the extent that a valuation allowance has been established and it is subsequently determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax\nassets will be recovered, the valuation allowance will be released.\nThe Company had valuation allowances of $2.4 billion and $1.8 billion as of January 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively, on deferred tax assets associated primarily with net operating loss carryforwards\nfor which management has determined it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

To the extent the Company does not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset\nwill be recovered, a valuation allowance is established.

The claimants allege that the work\nperformed by female employees in Asda's retail stores is of equal value in terms of, among other things, the demands of their jobs compared to that of male employees working in Asda's warehouse and\ndistribution facilities, and that the disparity in pay between these different job positions is not objectively justified. As a result, claimants are requesting differential back pay based on higher wage rates\nin the warehouse and distribution facilities and higher wage rates on a prospective basis.\nOn March 23, 2015, Asda asked the Employment Tribunal to stay all proceedings and to \"strike out\" substantially all of the claims because the claimants had not adhered to the Tribunal's procedural rule\nfor including multiple claimants on the same claim form. On July 23, 2015, the Employment Tribunal denied Asda's requests.

Based on\nthose guidelines, management's assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting excluded Flipkart Private Limited (\"Flipkart\"), which the Company acquired in\nfiscal 2019, except for the recognition of goodwill and intangible assets that were included in management's assessment. Flipkart represented approximately 2% of the Company’s total assets as of\nJanuary 31, 2019, after excluding goodwill and intangible assets recorded, and approximately 1% of the Company’s net sales for the year ended January 31, 2019. The Company's acquisition of Flipkart\nis discussed in Note 13 to its Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal 2019.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere has been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2019 , that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's\ninternal control over financial reporting.\nReport on Ethical Standards\nOur Company was founded on the belief that open communication and the highest ethical standards are necessary to be successful. Our long-standing \"Open Door\" communication policy helps\nmanagement be aware of and address issues in a timely and effective manner. Through the open door policy all associates are encouraged to inform management at the appropriate level when they are\nconcerned about any matter pertaining to Walmart.\nWalmart has adopted a Statement of Ethics to guide our associates in the continued observance of high ethical standards such as honesty, integrity and compliance with the law in the conduct of\nWalmart's business. Familiarity and compliance with the Statement of Ethics is required of all associates. The Company also maintains a separate Code of Ethics for our senior financial officers.\nWalmart also has in place a Related-Party Transaction Policy. This policy applies to Walmart's senior officers and directors and requires material related-party transactions to be reviewed by the Audit\nCommittee. The senior officers and directors are required to report material related-party transactions to Walmart. We maintain a global ethics and compliance office which oversees and administers\nseveral reporting mechanisms, including an ethics helpline. The ethics helpline provides a channel for associates to ask questions and make confidential complaints regarding potential violations of our\nstatements of ethics, including violations related to financial or accounting matters. These contacts may be made anonymously.\n/s/ C. Douglas McMillon\nC. Douglas McMillon\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\n/s/ M. Brett Biggs\nM.

GENERAL 1.1 Purpose. The purpose of the Walmart Deferred Compensation Matching Plan is to enable certain individuals to defer compensation and to be credited with matching allocations and earnings. The Plan is intended to reward such individuals for their contributions to the success of Walmart and its Related Affiliates. The Plan is also intended to assist such individuals in saving for retirement by providing benefits that are in excess of benefits permitted by applicable law under the 401(k) Plan. 1.2 Effective Date. The effective date of the amended and restated Plan is February 1, 2019. 1.3 Nature of Plan. The Plan is intended to be (and shall be administered as) an unfunded employee pension plan benefiting a select group of management or highly compensated employees under the provisions of ERISA. The Plan shall be “unfunded” for tax purposes and for purposes of Title I of ERISA. Any and all payments under the Plan shall be made solely from the general assets of Walmart. A Participant’s interests under the Plan do not represent or create a claim against specific assets of Walmart or any Employer. Nothing herein shall be deemed to create a trust of any kind or create any fiduciary relationship between the Committee, Walmart or any Employer and a Participant, the Participant’s beneficiary or any other person. To the extent any person acquires a right to receive payments from Walmart under this Plan, such right is no greater than the right of any other unsecured general creditor of Walmart. The Plan is intended to be in compliance with Code Section 409A and shall be interpreted, applied and administered at all times in accordance with Code Section 409A and guidance issued thereunder. ARTICLE II. DEFINITIONS 2.1 Definitions. Whenever used in this Plan, the following words and phrases have the meaning set forth below unless the context plainly requires a different meaning: (a) Account means the bookkeeping account maintained under the Plan to reflect a Participant’s Deferral Credits, Matching Contribution Credits, and earnings credited in accordance with Section 4.4.

The effective date of the amended and restated Plan is February 1, 2019. 1.3 Nature of Plan. The Plan is intended to be (and shall be administered as) an unfunded employee pension plan benefiting a select group of management or highly compensated employees under the provisions of ERISA. The Plan shall be “unfunded” for tax purposes and for purposes of Title I of ERISA. Any and all payments under the Plan shall be made solely from the general assets of Walmart. A Participant’s interests under the Plan do not represent or create a claim against specific assets of Walmart or any Employer. Nothing herein shall be deemed to create a trust of any kind or create any fiduciary relationship between the Committee, Walmart or any Employer and a Participant, the Participant’s beneficiary or any other person.
