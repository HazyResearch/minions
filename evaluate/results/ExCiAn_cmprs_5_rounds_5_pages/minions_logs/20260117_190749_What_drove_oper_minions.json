If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then please state that and explain why.\n\n---\n\nPlease provide succinct advice on the critical information we need to extract from the Financial document. Total length: 413989 characters to answer this question. \n\nAlso consider the following constraints:\n- In your response do NOT use numbered lists.\n- Do NOT structure your response as a sequence of steps.\n",
      "output": "To address the question about what drove the operating margin change for AMD as of FY22, focus on extracting key financial metrics and qualitative insights from the document. Look for sections discussing revenue growth, cost of goods sold, operating expenses, and any significant one-time charges or gains. Pay attention to management's commentary on market conditions, product launches, and competitive dynamics, as these can influence operating margins. Additionally, consider any strategic investments or acquisitions that might have impacted costs or revenue streams. If the document suggests that operating margin is not a useful metric for AMD, it might be due to the company's focus on growth and market share, which could prioritize revenue expansion over immediate profitability. In such cases, look for alternative metrics like gross margin or EBITDA that might provide a clearer picture of financial health."

Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 12 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`.

These forward-\nlooking statements are based on current expectations and beliefs and involve numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ\nmaterially from expectations. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date hereof or as of the dates indicated in the statements and should not\nbe relied upon as predictions of future events, as we cannot assure you that the events or circumstances reflected in these statements will be achieved or will\noccur. You can identify forward-looking statements by the use of forward-looking terminology including “believes,” “expects,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “seeks,”\n“intends,” “plans,” “pro forma,” “estimates,” “anticipates,” or the negative of these words and phrases, other variations of these words and phrases or\ncomparable terminology. The forward-looking statements relate to, among other things: possible impact of future accounting rules on AMD’s consolidated\nfinancial statements; demand for AMD’s products; the growth, change and competitive landscape of the markets in which AMD participates; international sales\nwill continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future; that AMD’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment balances together\nwith the availability under that certain revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Agreement) made available to AMD and certain of its subsidiaries, our\ncommercial paper program, and our cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund AMD’s operations including capital expenditures and purchase\ncommitments over the next 12 months and beyond; AMD’s ability to obtain sufficient external financing on favorable terms, or at all; AMD’s expectation that\nbased on management’s current knowledge, the potential liability related to AMD’s current litigation will not have a material adverse effect on its financial\nposition, results of operation or cash flows; anticipated ongoing and increased costs related to enhancing and implementing information security controls; all\nunbilled accounts receivables are expected to be billed and collected within 12 months; revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations that are\nunsatisfied which will be recognized in the next 12 months; and a small number of customers will continue to account for a substantial part of AMD’s revenue in\nthe future. For a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements, see “Part I, Item 1A-Risk\nFactors” and the “Financial Condition” section set forth in “Part II, Item  7-Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations,” or MD&A, and such ot",

Sales to this customer consisted of sales of products\nfrom our Gaming segment. A loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOriginal Equipment Manufacturers\nWe focus on three types of OEM partners: multi-nationals, selected regional accounts and selected global and local system integrators, who target commercial\nand consumer end customers of all sizes. Large multi-nationals and regional accounts are the core of our OEM partners’ business; however, we are\nincreasingly focused on the VAR channel which resells OEM systems to the mid-market and the small and medium business (SMB) segments. Additionally, we\nhave increased our focus on global system integrators, which resell OEM systems, coupled with their software and services solutions into Enterprise, high\nperformance computing (HPC) and Cloud Service Provider Customers. Our OEM customers include numerous foreign and domestic manufacturers of servers\nand workstations, desktops, notebooks, PC motherboards and game consoles.\nThird-Party Distributors\nOur authorized channel distributors resell to sub-distributors and OEMs, ODMs, and other customers. Typically, distributors handle a wide variety of products,\nand may include products from other manufacturers that compete with our products. Distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products. In most\ninstances, our agreements with distributors protect their inventory of our products against price reductions and provide certain return rights with respect to any\nproduct that we have removed from our price book or otherwise subject to discontinuation. In addition, some agreements with our distributors may contain\nstandard stock rotation provisions permitting limited product returns.\nAdd-in-Board (AIB) Manufacturers and System Integrators\nWe offer component-level graphics and chipset products to AIB manufacturers who in turn build and sell board-level products using our technology to system\nintegrators (SIs), retail buyers and sub distributors.

ARM-based designs are being used in the PC market, which could lead to further growth and\ndevelopment of the ARM ecosystem.\n9\n\n\nTable of Contents\nCompetition in Gaming Segment\nIn the graphics market, our principal competitor in the supply of discrete graphics is NVIDIA who is the market share leader. Intel also manufactures and sells\nembedded graphics processors and integrated graphics processor (IGP) chipsets. Also, Intel has developed their own gaming-focused discrete GPUs and has\nentered the market. Other competitors include suppliers of discrete graphics and integrated graphics processor (IGP) chipsets. Some of our competitors are\nsmaller companies, which may have greater flexibility to address specific market needs, but less financial resources to address the growing complexity of\ngraphics processors and the associated research and development costs. With respect to integrated graphics, higher unit shipments of our APUs and Intel’s\nintegrated graphics may drive computer manufacturers to reduce the number of systems they build paired with discrete graphics components, particularly for\nnotebooks, because they may offer satisfactory graphics performance for most mainstream PC users at a lower cost. We are the market share leader in semi-\ncustom game console products, where graphics performance is critical.\nCompetition in Embedded Segment\nWe expect continued competition from our primary FPGA competitors such as Intel, Lattice Semiconductor Corporation and Microsemi Corporation (Microsemi,\nacquired by Microchip), from ASSP vendors such as Broadcom Corporation, Marvell Technology Group, Ltd., Analog Devices, Texas Instruments Incorporated\nand NXP Semiconductors N.V., and from NVIDIA.

In February 2022, we completed our strategic\nacquisition of Xilinx, Inc. (Xilinx) which expanded our technology and product portfolio to include adaptable hardware platforms that enable hardware\nacceleration and rapid innovation across a variety of technologies and established AMD in multiple embedded markets where we have traditionally not had a\nsignificant presence. We now offer Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), Adaptive SoCs, and Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform (ACAP) products.\nWith the acquisition of Xilinx, we have access to a new set of markets and customers, further strengthening and diversifying our business model. In May 2022,\nwe expanded our data center solutions capabilities with the acquisition of Pensando Systems, Inc. (Pensando). We now offer high-performance data\nprocessing units (DPUs) and a software stack that complements our existing products. With the Xilinx and Pensando acquisitions, we are well positioned to\nprovide the industry’s broadest set of leadership compute engines and accelerators to help enable best performance, security, flexibility and total cost of\nownership for leading-edge data centers.\nOur 2022 financial results reflect the strength of our diversified business model despite the challenging PC market conditions in the second half of 2022. Net\nrevenue for 2022 was $23.6 billion, an increase of 44% compared to 2021 net revenue of $16.4 billion. The increase in net revenue was driven by a 64%\nincrease in Data Center segment revenue primarily due to higher sales of our EPYC™ server processors, a 21% increase in Gaming segment revenue\nprimarily due to higher semi-custom product sales, and a significant increase in Embedded segment revenue from the prior year period driven by the inclusion\nof Xilinx embedded product sales. This growth was partially offset by a 10% decrease in Client segment revenue primarily due to lower processor shipments\ndriven by a weak PC market and significant inventory correction actions across the PC supply chain. Gross margin, as a percentage of net revenue for 2022,\nwas 45%, compared to 48% in 2021. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition.\nOperating income for 2022 was $1.3 billion compared to operating income of $3.6 billion for 2021. The decrease in operating income was primarily driven by\namortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition. Net income for 2022 was $1.3 billion compared to $3.2 billion in the prior year. The\ndecrease in net income was primarily driven by lower operating income.\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2022 were $5.9 billion, compared to $3.6 billion at the end of 2021.

In November 2022, we established a\nnew commercial paper program, under which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum principal amount outstanding at any time of\n$3.0 billion with a maturity of up to 397 days from the date of issue. The commercial paper will be sold at a discount from par or, alternatively, will be sold at par\nand bear interest at rates that will vary based on market conditions at the time of issuance.

The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make\nestimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis, including\nthose related to our revenue, inventories, business combination, goodwill, long-lived and intangible assets, and income taxes. We base our estimates on\nhistorical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for\nmaking judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Although actual results have historically been reasonably consistent with management’s\nexpectations, the actual results may differ from these estimates or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions.\nManagement believes the following critical accounting estimates are the most significant to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most\ndifficult, subjective and complex judgments.\nRevenue Allowances.  Revenue contracts with our customers include variable amounts which we evaluate under ASC 606-10-32-8 through 14 in order to\ndetermine the net amount of consideration to which we are entitled and which we recognize as revenue. We determine the net amount of consideration to\nwhich we are entitled by estimating the most likely amount of consideration we expect to receive from the customer after adjustments to the contract price for\nrights of return and rebates to our original equipment manufacturers (OEM) customers and rights of return, rebates and price protection on unsold merchandise\nto our distributor customers.\nWe base our determination of necessary adjustments to the contract price by reference to actual historical activity and experience, including actual historical\nreturns, rebates and credits issued to OEM and distributor customers adjusted, as applicable, to include adjustments, if any, for known events or current\neconomic conditions, or both.\nOur estimates of necessary adjustments for distributor price incentives and price protection on unsold products held by distributors are based on actual\nhistorical incentives provided to distributor customers and known future price movements based on our internal and external market data analysis.\nOur estimates of necessary adjustments for OEM price incentives utilize, in addition to known pricing agreements, actual historical rebate attainment rates and\nestimates of future OEM rebate program attainment based on internal and external market data analysis.\nWe offer incent",

Where funds provided for such programs can be estimated, we\nrecognize a reduction to revenue at the time the related revenue is recognized; otherwise, we recognize such reduction to revenue at the later of when: i) the\nrelated revenue transaction occurs; or ii) the program is offered. For transactions where we reimburse a customer for a portion of the customer’s cost to perform\nspecific product advertising or marketing and promotional activities, such amounts are recognized as a reduction to revenue unless they qualify for expense\nrecognition.\nWe also provide limited product return rights to certain OEMs and to most distribution customers. These return rights are generally limited to a contractual\npercentage of the customer’s prior quarter shipments, although, from time to time we may approve additional product returns beyond the contractual\narrangements based on the applicable facts and circumstances. In order to estimate adjustments to revenue to account for these returns, including product\nrestocking rights provided to distributor and OEM customers, we utilize relevant, trended actual historical product return rate information gathered, adjusted for\nactual known information or events, as applicable.\nOverall, our estimates of adjustments to contract price due to variable consideration under our contracts with OEM and distributor customers, based on our\nassumptions and include adjustments, if any, for known events, have been materially consistent with actual results; however, these estimates are subject to\nmanagement’s judgment and actual provisions could be different from our estimates and current provisions, resulting in future adjustments to our revenue and\noperating results.\n42\n\n\nTable of Contents\nInventory Valuation. We value inventory at standard cost, adjusted to approximate the lower of actual cost or estimated net realizable value using assumptions\nabout future demand and market conditions.

In determining excess or obsolescence reserves for products, we consider assumptions such as\nchanges in business and economic conditions, other-than-temporary decreases in demand for our products, and changes in technology or customer\nrequirements. In determining the lower of cost or net realizable value reserves, we consider assumptions such as recent historical sales activity and selling\nprices, as well as estimates of future selling prices. If in any period we anticipate a change in assumptions such as future demand or market conditions to be\nless favorable than our previous estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales, resulting in a negative\nimpact to our gross margin in that period.

We allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired\nbased on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is\nrecorded as goodwill. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets.\nSignificant estimates in valuing developed technology, in-process research and development, customer relationships and other identifiable intangible assets\ninclude, but are not limited to, expected future revenue growth rates and margins, future changes in technology, time to recreate customer relationships, useful\nlives, and discount rates.\nManagement's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a\nresult, actual results may differ from estimates. Allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable assets and liabilities affects our amortization expense, as\nacquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the useful life, whereas any indefinite lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortized.\nDuring the measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.\nGoodwill. Goodwill is the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred over the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection\nwith business combinations. Our reporting units are at the operating segment level. Our goodwill is contained within three reporting units: Data Center, Gaming\nand Embedded.\nWe perform our goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year and, if certain events or circumstances indicate that an\nimpairment loss may have been incurred, on a more frequent basis. The analysis may include both qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the likelihood\nof an impairment, which occurs when the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value.

The fair values of our reporting units are estimated using a combination of the income approach, which requires estimating the present value of expected\nfuture cash flows of a reporting unit, and the market approach, which uses financial ratios of comparable companies to arrive at an estimated value for the\nreporting unit. Significant estimates and assumptions used in the income approach include assessments of macroeconomic conditions, growth rates of our\nreporting units in the near- and long-term, expectations of our ability to execute on our roadmap and projections, and the discount rate applied to cash flows.\nSignificant estimates used in the market approach include the identification of comparable companies for each reporting unit, the determination of an\nappropriate control premium that a market participant would apply to a reporting unit, and the determination of appropriate multiples to apply to a reporting unit\nbased on adjustments and consideration of specific attributes of that reporting unit.\n43\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe most significant assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair values of our reporting units are the sales and earnings growth rates\n(including long-term growth rates) and discount rates. Long-term growth rates are dependent on overall market growth rates, the competitive environment and\ninflation. As a result, long-term growth rates could be adversely impacted by a sustained deceleration in category growth or an increased competitive\nenvironment. Discount rates, which are consistent with a weighted average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by a market participant, are based upon\nindustry required rates of return, including consideration of both debt and equity components of the capital structure. Our discount rates may be impacted by\nadverse changes in the macroeconomic environment, prolonged and continuing inflationary pressures, volatility in the equity and debt markets and other factors\nthat otherwise create or exacerbate risks in our reporting units. Changes in operating plans or adverse changes in the business or in the macroeconomic\nenvironment in the future could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair values and could result in a decline in fair value that would trigger future\nimpairment charges of our reporting units’ goodwill. Based on our annual impairment testing, the fair values of all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying\nvalues.\nLong-Lived and Intangible Assets. Long-lived and intangible assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment if indicators of potential impairment exist\nand at least annually for indefinite-lived intangible assets. Impairment indicators are reviewed on a quarterly basis. Assets are grouped and evaluated for\nimpairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. When indi",

In the event such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the recorded value of the assets, the\nassets are written down to their estimated fair values based on the expected discounted future cash flows attributable to the asset group or based on\nappraisals. Factors affecting impairment of assets held for use include the ability of the specific assets to generate separately identifiable positive cash flows.\nWhen assets are removed from operations and held for sale, we estimate impairment losses as the excess of the carrying value of the assets over their fair\nvalue. Market conditions are among the factors affecting impairment of assets held for sale. Changes in any of these factors could necessitate impairment\nrecognition in future periods for assets held for use or assets held for sale.\nIncome Taxes. In determining taxable income for financial statement reporting purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and\njudgments are applied in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets which arise from temporary\ndifferences between the recognition of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement reporting purposes.\nWe regularly assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. Unless recovery is considered more-likely-than-not (a probability level\nof more than 50%), we will record a charge to income tax expense in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not\nultimately be recoverable or maintain the valuation allowance recorded in prior periods. When considering all available evidence, if we determine it is more-\nlikely-than-not we will realize our deferred tax assets, we will reverse some or all of the existing valuation allowance, which would result in a credit to income tax\nexpense and the establishment of an asset in the period of reversal.\nIn determining the need to establish or maintain a valuation allowance, we consider the four sources of jurisdictional taxable income: (i) carryback of net\noperating losses to prior years; (ii) future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences; (iii) viable and prudent tax planning strategies; and (iv) future\ntaxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards.\nThrough the end of 2022, we continue to maintain a valuation allowance of approximately $2.1 billion for certain federal, state, and foreign tax attributes. The\nfederal valuation allowance maintained is due to limitations, under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 or 383, separate return loss year rules, or dual\nconsolidated loss rules. Certain state and foreign valuation allowances are maintained due to a lack of sufficient sources of future taxable income.\nIn addition, the c",

We usually invest\nour cash in investments with short maturities or with frequent interest reset terms. Accordingly, our interest income fluctuates with short-term market conditions.\nAs of December 31, 2022, our investment portfolio consisted of fixed income instruments, time deposits and commercial paper. Our primary aim with our\ninvestment portfolio is to invest available cash while preserving principal and meeting liquidity needs. In accordance with our investment policy, we place\ninvestments with high credit quality issuers and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer based upon the issuer's credit rating. These securities are\nsubject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase.

Consequently, our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates\non reported interest expense and corresponding cash flows is minimal.\nWe will continue to monitor our exposure to interest rate risk.\nDefault Risk. We mitigate default risk in our investment portfolio by investing in only high credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to\nrespond to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. Our portfolio includes investments in marketable debt securities with\nactive secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity. We are averse to principal loss and strive to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk\nand market risk.\nWe actively monitor market conditions and developments specific to the securities and security classes in which we invest. We believe that we take a\nconservative approach to investing our funds in that we invest only in highly-rated debt securities with relatively short maturities and do not invest in securities\nwhich we believe involve a higher degree of risk. As of December 31, 2022, substantially all of our investments in debt securities were A-rated by at least one of\nthe rating agencies.

See Note 5 - Business Combinations for additional information on these\nacquisitions.\nNOTE 2 – Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies\nFiscal Year. The Company uses a 52- or 53-week fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in December. Fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 ended on December 31,\n2022, December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020, respectively. Fiscal 2022 consisted of 53 weeks, and fiscal 2021 and 2020 each consisted of 52 weeks.\nPrinciples of Consolidation.  The consolidated financial statements include the Company’s accounts and those of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Upon\nconsolidation, all inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated.\nReclassification. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.\nUse of Estimates. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requires\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of commitments and contingencies at\nthe date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results are likely to differ from\nthose estimates, and such differences may be material to the financial statements. Areas where management uses subjective judgment include, but are not\nlimited to, revenue allowances, inventory valuation, valuation of goodwill and long-lived and intangible assets, and income taxes.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration which the\nCompany expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Sales, value-added, and other taxes collected concurrently with the provision of goods or\nservices are excluded from revenue. Shipping and handling costs associated with product sales are included in cost of sales. Substantially all the Company’s\nrevenue is derived from product sales, representing a single performance obligation.\nCustomers are generally required to pay for products and services within the Company’s standard contractual terms, which are typically net 30 to 60 days. The\nCompany has determined that it does not have significant financing components in its contracts with customers.\nNon-custom products\nThe Company transf",

Non-custom product arrangements generally comprise a single\nperformance obligation. Certain OEMs may be entitled to rights of return and rebates under OEM agreements. The Company also sells to distributors under\nterms allowing the majority of distributors certain rights of return and price protection on unsold merchandise held by them. The Company estimates the amount\nof variable consideration under OEM and distributor arrangements and, accordingly, records a provision for product returns, allowances for price protection and\nrebates based on actual historical experience and any known events.\n57\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe Company offers incentive programs to certain customers, including cooperative advertising, marketing promotions, volume-based incentives and special\npricing arrangements. Where funds provided for such programs can be estimated, the Company recognizes a reduction to revenue at the time the related\nrevenue is recognized; otherwise, the Company recognizes such reduction to revenue at the later of when: i) the related revenue transaction occurs; or ii) the\nprogram is offered. For transactions where the Company reimburses a customer for a portion of the customer’s cost to perform specific product advertising or\nmarketing and promotional activities, such amounts are recognized as a reduction to revenue unless they qualify for expense recognition.\nConstraints of variable consideration have not been material.\nCustom products\nCustom products which are associated with the Company’s Gaming segment (semi-custom products), sold under non-cancellable purchases orders, for which\nthe Company has an enforceable right to payment, and which have no alternative use to the Company at contract inception, are recognized as revenue, over\nthe time of production of the products by the Company. The Company utilizes a cost-based input method, calculated as cost incurred plus estimated margin, to\ndetermine the amount of revenue to recognize for in-process, but incomplete, customer orders at a reporting date. The Company believes that a cost-based\ninput method is the most appropriate manner to measure how the Company satisfies its performance obligations to customers because the effort and costs\nincurred best depict the Company’s satisfaction of its performance obligation.\nSales of semi-custom products are not subject to a right of return. Custom products arrangements generally involve a single performance obligation.

Accordingly, revenue is recognized at a point in time when\nthe customer has the ability to benefit from the license.\nThere are no variable consideration estimates associated with either combined development and IP arrangements or for standalone arrangements involving\neither the sale or licensing of IP.\nInventories\nThe Company values inventory at standard cost, adjusted to approximate the lower of actual cost or estimated net realizable value using assumptions about\nfuture demand and market conditions. In determining excess or obsolescence reserves for its products, the Company considers assumptions such as changes\nin business and economic conditions, other-than-temporary decreases in demand for its products, and changes in technology or customer requirements.

When determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially\nwith respect to intangible assets. Critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, expected future revenue growth rates and\nmargins, future changes in technology, time to recreate customer relationships, useful lives, and discount rates. Fair value estimates are based on the\nassumptions that management believes a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability. These estimates are inherently uncertain and, therefore,\nactual results may differ from the estimates made. As a result, during the measurement period of up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may\nrecord adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or\nfinal determination of the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded in the\nConsolidated Statements of Operations.\nGoodwill\nThe Company performs its goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year and, if certain events or circumstances indicate that\nan impairment loss may have been incurred, on a more frequent basis. The analysis may include both qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the\nlikelihood of an impairment.\nThe Company has the option to first perform qualitative testing to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying\namount. Qualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, share price trends and market capitalization and\nCompany-specific events. If the Company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, the Company\ndoes not proceed to perform a quantitative impairment test.\nIf the Company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value or elects to bypass the qualitative test, a\nquantitative goodwill impairment test will be performed by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. The Company’s quantitative\nimpairment analysis uses a combination of the income approach, which requires estimates of the present value of expected future cash flows of a reporting\nunit, and the market approach, which uses financial ratios of comparable companies to arrive at an estimated value for the reporting units.

If a reporting unit’s fair value is determined to be less than its\ncarrying value, a goodwill impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying value, not to exceed\nthe total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nLong-Lived and Intangible Assets\nLong-lived and intangible assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment if indicators of potential impairment exist and at least annually for indefinite-\nlived intangible assets. Impairment indicators are reviewed on a quarterly basis. Assets are grouped and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level of\nidentifiable cash flows.\nWhen indicators of impairment exist and assets are held for use, the Company estimates future undiscounted cash flows attributable to the related asset\ngroups. In the event such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the recorded value of the assets, the assets are written down to their estimated\nfair values based on the expected discounted future cash flows attributable to the asset group or based on appraisals. Factors affecting impairment of assets\nheld for use include the ability of the specific assets to generate separately identifiable positive cash flows.\nWhen assets are removed from operations and held for sale, the Company estimates impairment losses as the excess of the carrying value of the assets over\ntheir fair value.

The Company classifies its investments in debt securities at the date of acquisition as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale\ndebt securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a\ncomponent of stockholders’ equity.

Unrealized gains and losses not\nattributable to credit losses are included, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders’ equity. Classification of\navailable-for-sale debt securities as current or non-current is based on the Company’s intent and belief in its ability to sell these securities and use the proceeds\nfrom sale in operations within 12 months.\nNon-marketable Securities. The Company’s investments in non-marketable securities of privately-held companies are accounted for under the measurement\nalternative, defined as cost, less impairments, adjusted for subsequent observable price changes and are periodically assessed for impairment when events or\ncircumstances indicate that a decline in value may have occurred. The Company's periodic assessment of impairment is made by considering available\nevidence, including the investee’s general market and industry conditions and product development status. The Company also assesses the investee’s ability to\nmeet business milestones, its financial condition, and near-term prospects, including the rate at which the investee is using its cash, the investee’s need for\npossible additional funding at a lower valuation and any bona fide offer to purchase the investee.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company’s financial instruments are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, except for non-marketable equity investments in privately-\nheld companies, which are generally accounted for under the measurement alternative.\nFair Value Hierarchy\nThe fair value framework requires the categorization of assets and liabilities into three levels based upon the assumptions (inputs) used to price the assets or\nliabilities.

Auditing management’s inventory carrying value adjustments involved\nsignificant judgment because the estimates are based on several factors that are affected by market, industry, and competitive\nconditions outside the Company's control. In estimating inventory carrying value adjustments, management developed\nassumptions such as forecasts of future sales quantities and the selling prices, which are sensitive to the competitiveness of\nproduct offerings, customer requirements, and product life cycles.

(“Xilinx”) for consideration of $48.8 billion, as\ndisclosed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination.\nAuditing the Company's accounting for its acquisition of Xilinx was complex due to the significant estimation uncertainty in the\nCompany’s determination of the fair value of certain identified intangible assets, principally consisting of developed technology\nand customer relationships. The significant estimation uncertainty was primarily due to the sensitivity of the respective fair values\nto underlying assumptions about the future performance of the acquired business. The Company used a discounted cash flow\nmodel to measure the developed technology and customer relationship intangible assets. The significant assumptions used to\nestimate the value of these intangible assets included certain assumptions that form the basis of the forecasted results,\nspecifically, revenue growth rates, technology migration curves, and time to recreate customer relationships.

A company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect\nthe transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being\nmade only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or\ntimely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n93\n\n\nTable of Contents\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance\nwith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nSan Jose, California\nFebruary 27, 2023\n94\n\n\nTable of Contents\nITEM 9.

This type of evaluation is performed on a quarterly basis so that conclusions of\nmanagement, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concerning the effectiveness of the disclosure controls can be reported in our\nperiodic reports on Form 10-Q and Form 10-K. The overall goals of these evaluation activities are to monitor our disclosure controls and to modify them as\nnecessary.

Based on the foregoing, our Chief\nExecutive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of the\nend of the period covered by this report.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nInternal control over financial reporting refers to the process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,\nand effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and\nthe preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and includes those policies and\nprocedures that:\n1.\nPertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the\nCompany;\n2.\nProvide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S.\ngenerally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of\nmanagement and directors of the Company; and\n3.\nProvide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that\ncould have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of\nsuch limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting.\nHowever, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to\nreduce, though not eliminate, this risk. Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the\nCompany.\n95\n\n\nTable of Contents\nManagement has used the 2013 framework set forth in the report entitled “Internal Control—Integrated Framework” published by the Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission to evaluate the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Management has\nconcluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December  31, 2022 at the reasonable assurance level.

      "output": "From the collected outputs, we have gathered several pieces of information related to AMD's operating margin changes in FY22:\n\n1. **Revenue Impact**: There was a decline in the Client segment revenue due to weak PC market conditions and inventory corrections. However, other segments like Data Center and Gaming saw revenue increases, with the Data Center segment experiencing a 64% increase and Gaming a 21% increase.\n\n2. **Cost Structure**: The gross margin decreased due to the amortization of intangible assets from the Xilinx acquisition. Operating expenses increased due to strategic investments, increased headcount, and acquisition-related costs.\n\n3. **Market Conditions**: The weak PC market and global economic uncertainty were highlighted as factors that could negatively impact operating margins.\n\n4. **Strategic Investments**: The acquisition of Xilinx and related amortization expenses were significant, impacting costs and potentially the operating margin.\n\n5. **Other Factors**: Inventory write-downs and increased depreciation expenses were noted, which could negatively affect the operating margin.\n\nThe information gathered is somewhat sufficient to understand the factors impacting AMD's operating margin in FY22. However, specific details about the actual operating margin percentage or a direct comparison to previous years are missing. We have qualitative insights into the factors affecting the margin but lack quantitative data to precisely calculate the change in operating margin.\n\nTo fully answer the question, we would need:\n- Specific operating margin figures for FY22 and previous years for comparison.\n- Detailed financial metrics that quantify the impact of the mentioned factors on the operating margin.\n\nIf we had these quantitative details, we could derive the answer by analyzing the net effect of revenue changes, cost increases, and strategic investments on the operating margin. In the absence of conflicting answers, the qualitative insights provided are consistent and point towards a decrease in operating margin due to increased costs and specific segment revenue declines."

Since 1981, we have discovered hazardous material releases to the groundwater\nfrom former underground tanks and proceeded to investigate and conduct remediation at these three sites. The chemicals released into the groundwater were\ncommonly used in the semiconductor industry in the United States in the wafer fabrication process prior to 1979.\nIn 1991, we received Final Site Clean-up Requirements Orders from the California Regional Water Quality Control Board relating to the three sites. We have\nentered into settlement agreements with other responsible parties on two of the orders. During the term of such agreements, other parties have agreed to\nassume most of the foreseeable costs as well as the primary role in conducting remediation activities under the orders. We remain responsible for additional\ncosts beyond the scope of the agreements as well as all remaining costs in the event that the other parties do not fulfill their obligations under the settlement\nagreements.\nTo address anticipated future remediation costs under the orders, we have computed and recorded an estimated environmental liability of approximately $3.9\nmillion and have not recorded any potential insurance recoveries in determining the estimated costs of the cleanup.

Many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in\nincreased costs, decreases in expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and attention, which could materially impact the combined company. In\naddition, even if the operations of the businesses are integrated successfully, the full benefits of the acquisitions may not be realized within the anticipated time\nframe or at all. All of these factors could decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the acquisitions and negatively impact the combined company. If we\ncannot successfully integrate our and the acquired companies’ businesses and operations, or if there are delays in combining the businesses, it could\nnegatively impact our ability to develop or sell new products and impair our ability to grow our business, which in turn could adversely affect our financial\ncondition and operating results.\nAcquisitions and joint ventures may also involve the entry into geographic or business markets in which we have little or no prior experience. Consequently, we\nmay not achieve anticipated benefits of acquisitions or joint ventures, which could harm our operating results. In addition, to complete an acquisition, we may\nissue equity securities, which would dilute our stockholders’ ownership and could adversely affect the price of our common stock, and/or incur debt, assume\ncontingent liabilities or have amortization expenses and write-downs of acquired assets, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Moreover, if\nsuch acquisitions or joint ventures require us to seek additional debt or equity financing, we may not be able to obtain such financing on terms favorable to us or\nat all.

Also, any failure on our part\nto effectively evaluate and execute new business initiatives could adversely affect our business.

(Xilinx) which expanded our technology and product portfolio to include adaptable hardware platforms that enable hardware\nacceleration and rapid innovation across a variety of technologies and established AMD in multiple embedded markets where we have traditionally not had a\nsignificant presence. We now offer Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), Adaptive SoCs, and Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform (ACAP) products.\nWith the acquisition of Xilinx, we have access to a new set of markets and customers, further strengthening and diversifying our business model. In May 2022,\nwe expanded our data center solutions capabilities with the acquisition of Pensando Systems, Inc. (Pensando). We now offer high-performance data\nprocessing units (DPUs) and a software stack that complements our existing products. With the Xilinx and Pensando acquisitions, we are well positioned to\nprovide the industry’s broadest set of leadership compute engines and accelerators to help enable best performance, security, flexibility and total cost of\nownership for leading-edge data centers.\nOur 2022 financial results reflect the strength of our diversified business model despite the challenging PC market conditions in the second half of 2022. Net\nrevenue for 2022 was $23.6 billion, an increase of 44% compared to 2021 net revenue of $16.4 billion. The increase in net revenue was driven by a 64%\nincrease in Data Center segment revenue primarily due to higher sales of our EPYC™ server processors, a 21% increase in Gaming segment revenue\nprimarily due to higher semi-custom product sales, and a significant increase in Embedded segment revenue from the prior year period driven by the inclusion\nof Xilinx embedded product sales. This growth was partially offset by a 10% decrease in Client segment revenue primarily due to lower processor shipments\ndriven by a weak PC market and significant inventory correction actions across the PC supply chain. Gross margin, as a percentage of net revenue for 2022,\nwas 45%, compared to 48% in 2021. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition.\nOperating income for 2022 was $1.3 billion compared to operating income of $3.6 billion for 2021. The decrease in operating income was primarily driven by\namortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition.

In order to estimate adjustments to revenue to account for these returns, including product\nrestocking rights provided to distributor and OEM customers, we utilize relevant, trended actual historical product return rate information gathered, adjusted for\nactual known information or events, as applicable.\nOverall, our estimates of adjustments to contract price due to variable consideration under our contracts with OEM and distributor customers, based on our\nassumptions and include adjustments, if any, for known events, have been materially consistent with actual results; however, these estimates are subject to\nmanagement’s judgment and actual provisions could be different from our estimates and current provisions, resulting in future adjustments to our revenue and\noperating results.\n42\n\n\nTable of Contents\nInventory Valuation. We value inventory at standard cost, adjusted to approximate the lower of actual cost or estimated net realizable value using assumptions\nabout future demand and market conditions. Material assumptions we use to estimate necessary inventory carrying value adjustments can be unique to each\nproduct and are based on specific facts and circumstances. In determining excess or obsolescence reserves for products, we consider assumptions such as\nchanges in business and economic conditions, other-than-temporary decreases in demand for our products, and changes in technology or customer\nrequirements. In determining the lower of cost or net realizable value reserves, we consider assumptions such as recent historical sales activity and selling\nprices, as well as estimates of future selling prices. If in any period we anticipate a change in assumptions such as future demand or market conditions to be\nless favorable than our previous estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales, resulting in a negative\nimpact to our gross margin in that period. If in any period we are able to sell inventories that ",

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK    \nInterest Rate Risk. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and long-term debt. We usually invest\nour cash in investments with short maturities or with frequent interest reset terms. Accordingly, our interest income fluctuates with short-term market conditions.\nAs of December 31, 2022, our investment portfolio consisted of fixed income instruments, time deposits and commercial paper. Our primary aim with our\ninvestment portfolio is to invest available cash while preserving principal and meeting liquidity needs. In accordance with our investment policy, we place\ninvestments with high credit quality issuers and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer based upon the issuer's credit rating. These securities are\nsubject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase. A hypothetical 50 basis-point (half percentage point) increase or\ndecrease in interest rates compared to rates at December 31, 2022 would have affected the fair value of our cash equ",

Revenue\nis recognized upon the transfer of control, over time or at a point in time, depending on the nature of the arrangements. The Company evaluates whether the\nlicensing component is distinct. A licensing component is distinct if it is both (i) capable of being distinct and (ii) distinct in the context of the arrangement. If the\nlicense is not distinct, it is combined with the development services as a single performance obligation and recognized over time. If the license is distinct,\nrevenue is recognized at a point in time when the customer has the ability to benefit from the license.\nFrom time to time, the Company may enter into arrangements with customers that solely involve the sale or licensing of its patents or IP. Generally, there are no\nperformance obligations beyond transferring the designated license to the Company’s patents or IP. Accordingly, revenue is recognized at a point in time when\nthe customer has the ability to benefit from the license.\nThere are no variable consideration estimates associated with either combined development and IP arrangements or for standalone arrangements involving\neither the sale or licensing of IP.\nInventories\nThe Company values inventory at standard cost, adjusted to approximate the lower of actual cost or estimated net realizable value using assumptions about\nfuture demand and market conditions. In determining excess or obsolescence reserves for its products, the Company considers assumptions such as changes\nin business and economic conditions, other-than-temporary decreases in demand for its products, and changes in technology or customer requirements.

Accounts\nreceivable also include unbilled receivables, which primarily represent work completed on development services recognized as revenue but not yet invoiced to\ncustomers and semi-custom products under non-cancellable purchase orders that have no alternative use to the Company at contract inception, for which\nrevenue has been recognized but not yet invoiced to customers. All unbilled accounts receivables are expected to be billed and collected within twelve months.\nThe Company manages its exposure to customer credit risk through credit limits, credit lines, ongoing monitoring procedures and credit approvals.\nFurthermore, the Company performs in-depth credit evalua",

One customer accounted for approximately 18% of the total consolidated\naccounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2022. Two customers each accounted for approximately 20% and 15% of the total consolidated accounts\nreceivable balance as of December 25, 2021. However, the Company does not believe the receivable balance from these customers represents a significant\ncredit risk based on past collection experience and review of their current credit quality.\nThe Company is exposed to credit losses from nonperformance by counterparties on foreign currency hedge contracts. These counterparties are large global\ninstitutions, and to date, no such counterparty has failed to meet its financial obligations to the Company.\nNOTE 11 – Earnings Per Share\nBasic earnings per sha",

In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company introduced the\n2017 ESPP, as amended and restated (the 2017 Plan).\nUnder the 2004 Plan, stock options generally vest and become exercisable over a three-year period from the date of grant and expire within seven years after\nthe grant date. Unvested shares that are reacquired by the Company from forfeited outstanding equity awards become available for grant and may be reissued\nas new awards.\nUnder the 2004 Plan, the Company can grant (i) stock options, and (ii) RSUs, including time-based RSUs and PRSUs.\nStock Options. Under the 2004 Plan, nonstatutory and incentive stock options may be granted. The exercise price of the shares subject to each nonstatutory\nstock option and incentive stock option cannot be less than 100% of the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of the grant. The\nexercise price of each option granted under the 2004 Plan must be paid in full at the time of the exercise.\nTime-based RSUs. Time-based RSUs are awards that can be granted to any employee, director or consultant and that obligate the Company to issue a specific\nnumber of shares of the Company’s common stock in the future if the vesting terms and conditions are satisfied.\nPRSUs. PRSUs can be granted to certain of the Company’s senior executives. The performance metrics can be financial performance, non-financial\nperformance and/or market conditions. Each PRSU award reflects a target number of shares (Target Shares) that may be issued to an award recipient before\nadjusting based on the Company’s financial performance, non-financial performance and/or market conditions. The actual number of shares that a grant\nrecipient receives at the end of the period may range from 0% to 250% of the Target Shares granted, depending upon the degree of achievement of the\nperformance target designated by each individual award.\n78\n\n\nTable of Contents\nESPP. Under the 2017 Plan, eligible employees who participate in an offering period may have up to 15% of their eligible earnings withheld, up to certain\nlimitations, to purchase shares of common stock at 85% of the lower of the fair market value on the first or the last business day of the six-month offering\nperiod. The offering periods commence in May and November each year.\nAs of December  31, 2022, the Company had 32 million shares of common stock that were available for future grants and 28 million shares reserved for\nissuance upon the exercise of outstanding stock options or the vesting of unvested RSUs, including PRSUs, under the 2004 Plan.

A company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect\nthe transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being\nmade only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or\ntimely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n93\n\n\nTable of Contents\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance\nwith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nSan Jose, California\nFebruary 27, 2023\n94\n\n\nTable of Contents\nITEM 9.

The changes in non-cash items that may have contributed to this decrease are:\n\n- Depreciation and amortization: increased by $3,767\n   Explanation: To extract information about operating expenses and their impact on operating margin, I will analyze the provided financial statements, specifically the \"Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows\" section.\n\nOperating expenses are typically included in the \"Adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities\" section of the cash flow statement. This section includes various non-cash items that affect net income but do not directly impact cash flows.\n\nHowever, the provided financial statements do not explicitly list operating expenses. Instead, they mention depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, amortization of debt discount and issuance costs, amortization of operating lease right-of-use assets, amortization of inventory fair value adjustment, loss on debt redemption, repurchase and conversion, loss on sale or disposal of property and equipment, and deferred income taxes.\n\nTo estimate the impact of these items on operating margin, we can look at the changes in net income and the corresponding changes in these non-cash items.\n\nFrom 2021 to 202\n\n### Chunk # 79\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 80\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 81\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 82\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 83\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 84\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 85\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 86\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 87\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`350`):\n   Answer: The increase in marketing and advertising expenses from 2020 to 2022 indicates an increase in operating expenses over the period.\n   Explanation: Based on the provided document excerpt, I was able to extract information about operating expenses and their impact on operating margin.\n\nOperating Expenses:\n- Marketing and Advertising Expenses: \n  - 2022: $683 million\n  - 2021: $578 million\n  - 2020: $314 million\n\nImpact on Operating Margin:\n- The document does not explicitly mention operating margin or its calculation. However, it does provide information about the recognition of certain expenses, such as stock-based compensation and contingencies, which could impact operating expenses and, consequently, operating margin.\n\nChanges in Operating Expenses:\n- There is an increase in marketing and advertising expenses from 2020 to 2022, indicating an increase in operating expenses over the period.\n\nHowever, without more information about the revenue and other expenses, it is difficult to determine the exact impact on operating margin.\n   Citation: \"Total marketing and advertising expenses for 2022, 2021 and 2020 were approximately $683 million, $578 million and $314 million, respectively.\"\n\n### Chunk # 88\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 89\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 90\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`362`):\n   Answer: The depreciation expense for 2022, 2021, and 2020 was $439 million, $296 million, and $217 million, respectively. This indicates an increase in depreciation expense from 2021 to 2022.\n\nThe total property and equipment, net decreased from $702 million in 2021 to $1,513 million in 2022.\n   Explanation: To extract information about operating expenses and their impact on operating margin, I will analyze the provided document excerpt. \n\nOperating expenses are not directly mentioned in the excerpt, but we can infer some information about depreciation expense, which is a non-cash operating expense. The depreciation expense for 2022, 2021, and 2020 was $439 million, $296 million, and $217 million, respectively.\n\nWe can also calculate the operating income by subtracting the depreciation expense from the net income or by analyzing the change in total property and equipment, net. \n\nHowever, the excerpt does not provide information about the operating income or operating expenses directly. \n\nTo calculate the operating margin, we would need the operating income and revenue. The excerpt provides revenue information, but not the operating income.\n\nTherefore, I will focus on the depreciation expense and its impact on the total property and equipment, net.\n\nFrom the excerpt, we can see that the total property and equipment, net decreased from $702 million\n\n### Chunk # 91\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`366`):\n   Answer: For 2022: Operating expenses = $23,601M - $1,264M = $22,337M\nFor 2021: Operating expenses = $16,434M - $3,648M = $12,786M\nFor 2020: Operating expenses = $9,763M - $1,369M = $8,394M\n\nTo find the operating margin, we can divide the total operating income (loss) by the total net revenue.\n   Explanation: To extract information about operating expenses and their impact on operating margin, I will analyze the provided tables and text.\n\nFrom the table of operating income (loss) by segment, I can see that the total operating income (loss) for 2022, 2021, and 2020 are $1,264M, $3,648M, and $1,369M, respectively.\n\nTo find the operating expenses, I will look at the total operating income (loss) and compare it with the total net revenue. The total net revenue for 2022, 2021, and 2020 are $23,601M, $16,434M, and $9,763M, respectively.\n\nOperating expenses can be calculated by subtracting the total operating income (loss) from the total net revenue.\n\nFor 2022: Operating expenses = $23,601M - $1,264M = $22,337M\nFor 2021: Operating expenses =\n\n### Chunk # 92\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 93\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`374`):\n   Answer: The impact of the changes on operating margin cannot be determined from the provided document excerpt.\n   Explanation: Based on the provided document excerpt, I found the following information related to operating expenses and their impact on operating margin:\n\n1. The fair value of the identified intangible assets subject to amortization are amortized over the assets' estimated useful lives based on the pattern in which the economic benefits are expected to be received to cost of sales and operating expenses. This implies that operating expenses will increase due to the amortization of these intangible assets.\n\n2. In 2022, Pensando acquisition-related costs of $102 million were recorded under Cost of sales, Research and development, and Marketing, general and administrative expenses on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations.

This is a significant one-time event that likely had a significant impact on the company's operating margin.\n2. **Purchases and sales of short-term investments**: The company had significant gains and losses from the maturity of short-term investments, including a gain of $4,310 million in 2021 and a loss of $850 million in 2022.\n3. **Proceeds from debt and repayment of debt**: The company had significant proceeds from debt issuance and repayment of debt, which can\n\n### Chunk # 80\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`323`):\n   Answer: The document does not provide specific information about the impact of one-time charges or gains on the operating margin.\n   Explanation: Based on the provided document excerpt, I will search for any information related to one-time charges or gains and their impact on operating margin.\n\nMy reasoning for answering this task is to carefully read through the document and identify any sections or phrases that mention one-time events, such as acquisitions, reclassifications, or other non-recurring transactions, and their effects on the company's financial statements, particularly the operating margin.\n\nAfter reviewing the document, I found the following relevant information:\n\nThe document mentions two significant one-time events:\n\n1. The acquisition of Xilinx, Inc. on February 14, 2022, and the acquisition of Pensando Systems, Inc. on May 26, 2022. These acquisitions are likely to have had a significant impact on the company's operating margin, but the document does not provide specific details on the effects of these acquisitions.\n\n2.

This implies that the Company may incur one-time charges or adjustments related to acquisitions.\n- The document also mentions that any subsequent adjustments to the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, which may include one-time gains or losses.\n- However, there is no specific information about the impact of these one-time charges or gains on the operating margin.\n\nTherefore, I will provide a concise answer based on the available information.\n\nThe Company may incur one-time charges or adjustments related to acquisitions, and any subsequent adjustments to the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition are recorded in the Consolid\n   Citation: During the measurement period of up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill.\n\n### Chunk # 84\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`339`):\n   Answer: Goodwill impairment charges are recognized when a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value.\n   Explanation: Based on the provided document excerpt, I will focus on extracting information related to one-time charges or gains and their impact on operating margin.\n\nUpon reviewing the excerpt, I found relevant information related to goodwill impairment charges, which can be considered a one-time charge. According to the excerpt, if a reporting unit's fair value is determined to be less than its carrying value, a goodwill impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\n\nThis information suggests that goodwill impairment charges can have a significant impact on the company's operating margin, as they represent a non-recurring expense that can reduce the company's profitability.\n\nHere is the extracted information:\n\n* Goodwill impairment charges are recognized when a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value.\n* The impairment charge is limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\n* Goodwill impairment charges can have a significant\n   Citation: \"If a reporting unit’s fair value is determined to be less than its carrying value, a goodwill impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\"\n\n### Chunk # 85\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 86\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 87\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`351`):\n   Answer: The gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in earnings, which may impact the operating margin. However, the specific impact is not provided in the excerpt.\n   Explanation: Based on the provided document excerpt, I will focus on extracting information about one-time charges or gains and their impact on operating margin.\n\nUpon reviewing the excerpt, I found relevant information related to foreign currency translation and remeasurement. The excerpt mentions that gains or losses arising from translation of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity. However, it also mentions that the gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in earnings.\n\nThis information suggests that there may be one-time gains or losses related to foreign currency remeasurement, which could impact the operating margin. However, the excerpt does not provide specific information about the magnitude of these gains or losses or their impact on the operating margin.\n\nTherefore, my answer is:\n\nThe gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in earnings, which may impact the operating margin. However, the specific impact is not provided in the excerpt.\n   Citation: The gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in earnings, which may impact the operating margin.

The excerpt primarily discusses the Company's involvement in various legal actions, tax claims, and environmental matters, as well as its accounting methods for income taxes and Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI).\n\nHowever, there is a mention of a one-time change in accounting method for GILTI tax in 2022, which resulted in a $27.3 billion recording of identified intangible assets. This could potentially have an impact on the Company's operating margin, but the excerpt does not provide any information on the specific impact.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the task is:\n\nThe one-time change in accounting method for GILTI tax in 2022 resulted in a $27.3 billion recording of identified intangible assets, but the impact on operating margin is not specified in the provided excerpt.\n   Citation: \"In 2022, the Company elected to change its method of accounting for the United States GILTI tax from recording the tax impact in the period it is incurred to recognizing deferred taxes for temporary tax basis differences expected to reverse as GILTI tax in future years. The change is considered preferable based on the Company’s facts and circumstances as it provides better and more timely information of expected future income tax liabilities arising from temporary tax differences primarily associated with the Xilinx acquisition. As a result of the acquisition, the Company recorded $27.3 billion of identified intangible assets (refer to Note 5 - Business Combinations), of which $16.9 billion are related to foreign operations which will be amortized to income from operations over the assets’\n\n### Chunk # 89\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`359`):\n   Answer: The one-time accounting policy changes resulted in a positive impact on net income and earnings per share. \n\nThe first change resulted in a decrease in the income tax provision with a corresponding increase to net income of $296 million and an increase in basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.19.\n\nThe second change resulted in a decrease in Interest expense and a corresponding increase to Income before income taxes and equity income and Income tax provision (benefit) of $11 million in 2022.\n   Explanation: Based on the provided document excerpt, I found relevant information about one-time charges or gains and their impact on operating margin. \n\nThe information is as follows:\n\n- A one-time accounting policy change resulted in the recording of $857 million of deferred tax liabilities in connection with the Xilinx acquisition. This change resulted in a decrease in the income tax provision with a corresponding increase to net income of $296 million and an increase in basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.19.\n\n- Another one-time accounting policy change resulted in a decrease in Interest expense and a corresponding increase to Income before income taxes and equity income and Income tax provision (benefit) of $11 million in 2022.\n\nThese one-time changes had a positive impact on net income and earnings per share, which can be considered as gains.\n   Citation: \"In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2022, it resulted in a decrease in the income tax provision with a corresponding increase to net income of $296 million and an increase in basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.19, as compared to the computation under the previous accounting policy.\"\n\nThis citation supports the explanation that the one-time accounting policy change resulted in a positive impact on net income and earnings per share.\n\n### Chunk # 90\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 91\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`367`):\n   Answer: The one-time charges or gains that had a significant impact on the operating margin are:\n\n* Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles: $3,548 million in 2022, which is a non-cash expense that affects the operating margin.\n* Stock-based compensation expense: $1,081 million in 2022, $379 million in 2021, and $274 million in 2020, which are non-cash expenses that affect the operating margin.\n* Acquisition-related costs\n   Explanation: Based on the provided document excerpt, I found information about one-time charges or gains in the context of the \"All Other\" category, specifically in the table that summarizes items included in this category.\n\nThe relevant information is as follows:\n\n* In 2022, the Company reported an operating loss of $4,979 million in the \"All Other\" category, which includes:\n + Stock-based compensation expense: $1,081 million\n + Acquisition-related costs: $452 million\n + Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles: $3,548 million\n + Licensing gain: -$102 million\n* In 2021, the Company reported an operating loss of $409 million in the \"All Other\" category, which includes:\n + Stock-based compensation expense: $379 million\n + Acquisition-related costs: $42 million\n + Licensing gain: -$12 million\n* In 2020, the Company reported an operating loss of $288 million in the \"All Other\" category, which\n   Citation: \"In addition to these reportable segments, the Company has an All Other category, which is not a reportable segment.

Acquisition-related costs: The Company recorded Xilinx acquisition-related costs of $350 million in 2022, which were primarily comprised of direct transaction costs, fair value adjustments for acquired inventory, and certain compensation charges. These costs were recorded under Cost of sales, Research and development, and Marketing, general and administrative expenses on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\n2. Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles: The Company did not include $4.2 billion of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles in the operating income attributable to Xilinx recorded under the Embedded and Data Center segments.

The document mentions \"amortization expense of acquired Xilinx inventory fair value step-up of $184 million in fiscal year 2021\" which is a one-time charge related to the acquisition.\n2. The document also mentions \"expense from assumed stock-based compensation awards\" which is a one-time charge related to the acquisition.\n\nHowever, I did not find any information about one-time gains.\n\nTo calculate the impact on operating margin, we need to know the operating income before and after the one-time charge.

      "output": "### Analysis\n\n1. **Information Gathered:**\n   - **Revenue Growth:** AMD's revenue increased by 44% from $16.4 billion in 2021 to $23.6 billion in 2022. However, the gross margin decreased from 48% to 45%, and operating income decreased from $3.6 billion to $1.3 billion. The decline in the Client segment revenue and increased costs due to the Xilinx acquisition were significant factors.\n   - **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):** The COGS increased, contributing to a decrease in gross margin. Factors such as higher inventory unit costs and amortization of intangible assets from the Xilinx acquisition impacted the COGS.\n   - **Operating Expenses:** There was a significant increase in operating expenses, including research and development, marketing, and administrative expenses. The amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and stock-based compensation also contributed to higher operating expenses.\n   - **One-time Charges/Gains:** The amortization of intangible assets related to the Xilinx acquisition was a significant one-time charge. Other one-time events included licensing gains and acquisition-related costs.\n\n2. **Sufficiency of Information:**\n   - The information is sufficient to understand the factors affecting AMD's operating margin in FY22. The decline in operating margin was primarily driven by increased costs from the Xilinx acquisition, higher operating expenses, and a decrease in gross margin due to increased COGS.\n\n3. **Missing Information:**\n   - While the gathered information provides a comprehensive view of the factors affecting the operating margin, specific numerical data on the exact impact of each factor on the operating margin would provide a clearer picture.\n\n4. **Deriving the Answer:**\n   - To calculate the operating margin, we would use the formula: \\(\\text{Operating Margin} = \\frac{\\text{Operating Income}}{\\text{Net Revenue}}\\). For 2022, this would be \\(\\frac{1.3 \\text{ billion}}{23.6 \\text{ billion}} \\approx 5.51\\%\\).\n\n5. **Conflicting Answers:**\n   - There are no significant conflicting answers in the gathered information. The citations consistently point to the Xilinx acquisition and increased operating expenses as key factors affecting the operating margin.\n\nIn conclusion, the gathered information is sufficient to answer the question about what drove the change in AMD's operating margin for FY22. The primary drivers were increased costs from the Xilinx acquisition, higher operating expenses, and a decrease in gross margin due to increased COGS."

The decline in the Client segment revenue and increased costs due to the Xilinx acquisition were significant factors. COGS increased, contributing to a decrease in gross margin. Operating expenses increased significantly, including research and development, marketing, and administrative expenses. The amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and stock-based compensation also contributed to higher operating expenses. The amortization of intangible assets related to the Xilinx acquisition was a significant one-time charge.\"\n}"
