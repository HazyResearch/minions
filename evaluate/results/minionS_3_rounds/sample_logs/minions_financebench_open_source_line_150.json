  "correctness_reasoning": "The predicted answer correctly calculates the unadjusted EBITDA for each fiscal year by adding the unadjusted operating income and depreciation and amortization. It then calculates the EBITDA % margin for each year and provides the 3-year average, which matches the ground truth answer of 6.2%. The calculations and the final average are consistent with the ground truth, and the answer is within the allowed tolerance."
