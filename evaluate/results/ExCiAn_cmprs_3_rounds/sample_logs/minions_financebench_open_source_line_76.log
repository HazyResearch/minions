--- Question ---
What is the FY2018 fixed asset turnover ratio for CVS Health? Fixed asset turnover ratio is defined as: FY2018 revenue / (average PP&E between FY2017 and FY2018). Round your answer to two decimal places. Calculate what was asked by utilizing the line items clearly shown in the P&L statement and the balance sheet.

--- Predicted Answer ---
Using the first set of PP&E values, the fixed asset turnover ratio is $194,579 / $10,820.5 = 17.98. Using the second set, it is $194,579 / $25,579.5 = 7.61. Therefore, the fixed asset turnover ratio for FY2018 is between 7.61 and 17.98, depending on the PP&E values used.

--- Ground Truth ---
['17.98']

--- Correctness Evaluation ---
Is correct: False
Confidence: 0.80
Reasoning: The ground truth answer is a single value of 17.98, while the predicted answer provides a range between 7.61 and 17.98. The correct fixed asset turnover ratio should be a single value, not a range. The predicted answer does not align with the ground truth, which specifies a precise value.
