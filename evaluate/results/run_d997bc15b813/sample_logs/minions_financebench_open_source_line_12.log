--- Question ---
What is Adobe's year-over-year change in unadjusted operating income from FY2015 to FY2016 (in units of percents and round to one decimal place)? Give a solution to the question by using the income statement.

--- Predicted Answer ---
The year-over-year change in unadjusted operating income from FY2015 to FY2016 cannot be determined due to inconsistent and missing data.

--- Ground Truth ---
['65.4%']

--- Correctness Evaluation ---
Is correct: False
Confidence: 0.90
Reasoning: The ground truth answer provides a specific percentage (65.4%) for the year-over-year change in unadjusted operating income from FY2015 to FY2016, which falls within a 10% tolerance range of 58.9% to 71.9%. The predicted answer states that the change cannot be determined due to inconsistent and missing data, which contradicts the ground truth. Therefore, the predicted answer is incorrect.
