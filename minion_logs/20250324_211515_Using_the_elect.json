  "context": "Patient Name: John A. Doe\nMedical Record Number: 001234567\nDOB: 1967-08-22\nGender: Male\nAdmission Date: 2025-01-15\nDischarge Date: 2025-01-20\n\nChief Complaint:\nThe patient presented with chest discomfort, shortness of breath, and fatigue. Symptoms began gradually 48 hours before admission and intensified over time.\n\nHistory of Present Illness:\nJohn A. Doe, a 57-year-old male with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension, was admitted following several episodes of atypical chest pain. He experienced intermittent chest tightness and dyspnea on exertion. The pain did not radiate, and there was no associated nausea.\n\nPast Medical History:\n- Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (diagnosed 2010) – managed with metformin.\n- Hypertension (diagnosed 2012) – treated with lisinopril.\n- Hyperlipidemia – treated with atorvastatin.\n- Former smoker (quit 2015).\n- No known drug allergies.\n\nMedications on Admission:\n- Metformin 1000 mg twice daily.\n- Lisinopril 20 mg daily.\n- Atorvastatin 40 mg nightly.\n- Aspirin 81 mg daily.\n\nPhysical Examination:\nGeneral: The patient is alert and oriented, in moderate distress.\nCardiovascular: Blood pressure 150/95 mmHg; heart rate 88 bpm; regular rhythm.\nRespiratory: Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally; respiratory rate 16 bpm.\nNeurological: No focal deficits observed.\n\nLaboratory and Diagnostic Findings (Admission):\n- Complete Blood Count: WBC 7.2 x10^9/L, Hemoglobin 13.5 g/dL.\n- Basic Metabolic Panel: Serum creatinine 1.0 mg/dL; electrolytes normal.\n- Fasting Blood Glucose: 180 mg/dL.\n- Hemoglobin A1C: 8.5%.\n- Lipid Profile: Total Cholesterol 220 mg/dL, LDL 140 mg/dL, HDL 35 mg/dL.\n- ECG: Non-specific ST-T changes.\n- Chest X-ray: No acute findings.\n\nProgress Notes:\nDay 2: Initiated subcutaneous insulin to complement oral hypoglycemics. Blood pressure remained elevated at 148/92 mmHg.\nDay 3: Follow-up labs showed a minor improvement in glycemic levels and stable kidney function.\nDay 5: Vital signs improved with a blood pressure of 140/85 mmHg and heart rate of 80 bpm. A repeat lab indicated that the fasting blood glucose had decreased significantly compared to admission.\nDay 6: Endocrinology recommended maintaining current treatment with a possible gradual reduction in insulin if improvements continue.\nDay 7: Patient stabilized and was discharged with clear instructions for follow-up with both primary care and endocrinology.\n\nDischarge Summary:\nJohn A. Doe was discharged on Day 7 after noticeable improvements in glycemic control and blood pressure. The patient is to continue current medications with a scheduled outpatient review.\nMedications at Discharge:\n- Metformin 1000 mg BID.\n- Lisinopril 20 mg daily.\n- Atorvastatin 40 mg nightly.\n- Adjusted insulin regimen based on recent glycemic trends.\n\nAdditional Information:\n- Admission weight: 95 kg (BMI: 31.2).\n- Dietary consult completed; patient advised on a diabetic diet.\n- Patient educated on adherence and regular blood glucose monitoring.\n\nSummary:\nThis electronic health record details John A. Doe's hospital admission, clinical findings, laboratory values, treatments, and progress over a 7-day period. Key values include a fasting blood glucose of 180 mg/dL on admission and 150 mg/dL on Day 5, indicating a notable improvement in glycemic control.\n",
