  "question": "Are JPM's gross margins historically consistent (not fluctuating more than roughly 2% each year)? If gross margins are not a relevant metric for a company like this, then please state that and explain why.",
  "predicted_answer": "Gross margins are not a relevant metric for JPMorgan Chase. As a financial institution, JPMorgan Chase's performance is better evaluated using metrics such as net interest margin, return on assets, and return on equity. These metrics provide insights into the bank's profitability and operational efficiency.",
  "ground_truth": [
    "Since JPM is a financial institution, gross margin is not a relevant metric."
