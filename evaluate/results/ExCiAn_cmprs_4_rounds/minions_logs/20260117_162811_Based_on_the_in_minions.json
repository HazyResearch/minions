      "output": "To determine AES's FY2022 return on assets (ROA), focus on extracting specific financial data from the document. You need the net income for FY2022, which is typically found in the statement of income. Additionally, gather the total assets for both FY2021 and FY2022 from the statement of financial position. Calculate the average total assets by adding the total assets for FY2021 and FY2022 and dividing by two. With these figures, compute the ROA by dividing the FY2022 net income by the average total assets. Ensure all figures are accurate and round the final ROA to two decimal places for precision."

      "prompt": "# Decomposition Round #1\n\nYou (the supervisor) cannot directly read the document(s). Instead, you can assign small, isolated tasks to a less capable worker model that sees only a single chunk of text at a time. Any cross-chunk or multi-document reasoning must be handled by you.\n\n## Your Job: Write Two Python Functions\n\n### FUNCTION #1: `prepare_jobs(context, prev_job_manifests, prev_job_outputs) -> List[JobManifest]`\n- Break the document(s) into chunks (using the provided chunking function, if needed). Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 12 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`. All **multi-chunk integration** or **global reasoning** is your responsibility here.\n- Return one **aggregated string** suitable for further supervisor inspection.\n\n\n\n## Relevant Pydantic Models\n\nThe following models are already in the global scope. **Do NOT redefine or re-import them.**\n\n### JobManifest Model\n```\nclass JobManifest(BaseModel):\n    chunk: str  # the actual text for the chunk of the document\n    task: str  # the actual task instruction for the small model\n    advice: str  # optional, any additional advice on how to perform the task\n\n    chunk_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    task_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    job_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n\n```\n\n### JobOutput Model\n```\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    citation: Optional[str]\n    answer: Optional[str]\n\n```\n\n## Function Signatures\n```\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        context (List[str]): A list of documents.

There is a substantial need for more renewable energy as well as an opportunity for innovation\nto develop new products and solutions that help customers accomplish their individual decarbonization goals.\nThe focus of our strategy continues to be on partnering with large companies that are looking to transition to carbon-free sources of\nelectricity. As an indication of our success, in 2022 we were recognized by BNEF as the #1 global clean energy developer for corporations.\nIn 2022, we signed long-term contracts for 5.2 GW of renewable power, bringing our backlog of projects — those with signed contracts, but\nwhich are not yet in operation — to 12.2 GW. Our backlog serves as the core component of future growth.\nCentral to our renewables growth strategy is a focus on customer collaboration and co-creation, which helps us develop unique solutions\ntailored to a specific customer's needs. This approach not only contributes to customer satisfaction and repeat business, but it also allows AES\nto work with key customers on a bilateral basis rather than just through participation in bid processes.\nThis approach has led to the co-creation of several first-of-its-kind industry innovations, including agreements to supply 24/7 carbon-free\nenergy for global data center companies. Our unique capabilities in developing tailored energy solutions, enabled us to partner with Air Products\nto announce our plans to develop, build, own, and operate the largest green hydrogen production facility to date in the United States.\nWe are also working with some of the world's largest mining companies in their transition to renewable energy in South America, essentially\nreducing the emissions of major supply chains. One way in which we are serving the\n\n\n6 | 2022 Annual Report\nmining industry is through our Green Blend offering, in which we work to integrate renewable energy with thermal power during select hours of\nthe day, reducing overall thermal generation and lowering emissions.\nWith our utilities, we are working with a broad range of stakeholders to transition to lower carbon forms of energy while promoting a Just\nTransition for the workers and communities who may be negatively impacted by the closure of fossil fuel facilities. At AES Indiana, for example,\nwe are working to retire its remaining coal generation by the end of 2025, while adding new renewables and natural gas to the grid.\nOur renewable growth strategy includes taking steps to ensure and enable growth in future years. We massively expanded our pipeline of\ndevelopment projects, which grew from 55 GW in January 2022 to 64 GW as of the end of 2022, both through acquisitions and increased\ninvestment in development activities, such as securing land or advancing permitting and interconnection processes.

When the contract does not include a\nfuel pass-through, we typically hedge fuel costs or enter into fuel or energy supply agreements for a similar contract period (see discussion\nbelow under Fuel Costs). These\n\n\n7 | 2022 Annual Report\ncontracts also help us to fund a significant portion of the total capital cost of the project through long-term non-recourse project-level financing.\nCertain contracts include capacity payments that cover projected fixed costs of the plant, including fixed O&M expenses, debt service, and\na return on capital invested. In addition, most of our contracts require that the majority of the capacity payments be denominated in the currency\nmatching our fixed costs.\nContracts that do not have significant fuel cost or do not contain a capacity payment are structured based on long-term spot prices with\nsome negotiated pass-through costs, allowing us to recover expected fixed and variable costs as well as provide a return on investment.\nThese contracts are intended to reduce exposure to the volatility of fuel and electricity prices by linking the business's revenues and costs.\nWe generally structure our business to eliminate or reduce foreign exchange risk by matching the currency of revenue and expenses, including\nfixed costs and debt. Our project debt may consist of both fixed and floating rate debt for which we typically hedge a significant portion of our\nexposure. Some of our contracted businesses also receive a regulated market-based capacity payment, which is discussed in more detail in the\nShort-Term Sales section below.\nThus, these contracts, or other related commercial arrangements, significantly mitigate our exposure to changes in power and, as\napplicable, fuel prices, currency fluctuations and changes in interest rates. In addition, these contracts generally provide for a recovery of our\nfixed operating expenses and a return on our investment, as long as we operate the plant to the reliability and efficiency standards required in\nthe contract.\nShort-Term Sales — Our other generation businesses sell power and ancillary services under short-term contracts with average terms of\nless than two years, including spot sales, directly in the short-term market or at regulated prices. The short-term markets are typically\nadministered by a system operator to coordinate dispatch. Short-term markets generally operate on merit order dispatch, where the least\nexpensive generation facilities, based upon variable cost or bid price, are dispatched first and the most expensive facilities are dispatched last.\nThe short-term price is typically set at the marginal cost of energy or bid price (the cost of the last plant required to meet system demand).

In\naddition, many of these wholesale markets include markets for ancillary services to support the reliable operation of the transmission system.\nAcross our portfolio, we provide a wide array of ancillary services, including voltage support, frequency regulation and spinning reserves.\nMany of the short-term markets in which we operate include regulated capacity markets. These capacity markets are intended to provide\nadditional revenue based upon availability without reliance on the energy margin from the merit order dispatch. Capacity markets are typically\npriced based on the cost of a new entrant and the system capacity relative to the desired level of reserve margin (generation available in excess\nof peak demand). Our generating facilities selling in the short-term markets typically receive capacity payments based on their availability in the\nmarket.\nPlant Reliability and Flexibility — Our contract and short-term sales provide incentives to our generation plants to optimally manage\navailability, operating efficiency and flexibility. Capacity payments under contract sales are frequently tied to meeting minimum standards. In\nshort-term sales, our plants must be reliable and flexible to capture peak market prices and to maximize market-based revenues. In addition, our\nflexibility allows us to capture ancillary service revenue while meeting local market needs.\nFuel Costs — For our thermal generation plants, fuel is a significant component of our total cost of generation. For contract sales, we often\nenter into fuel supply agreements to match the contract period, or we may financially hedge our fuel costs. Some of our contracts include\nindexation for fuels. In those cases, we seek to match our fuel supply agreements to the indexation. For certain projects, we have tolling\narrangements where the power offtaker is responsible for the supply and cost of fuel to our plants.\nIn short-term sales, we sell power at market prices that are generally reflective of the market cost of fuel at the time, and thus procure fuel\nsupply on a short-term basis, generally designed to match up with our market sales profile. Since fuel price is often the primary determinant for\npower prices, the economics of projects with short-term sales are often subject to volatility of relative fuel prices.

Additionally, weather variations, including temperature, solar and wind\nresources, and hydrological conditions, may also have an impact on generation output at our renewable generation facilities. In competitive\nmarkets for power, local economic activity can also have an impact on power demand and short-term prices for power.\nFixed-Cost Management — In our businesses with long-term contracts, the majority of the fixed O&M costs are recovered through the\ncapacity payment. However, for all generation businesses, managing fixed costs and reducing them over time is a driver of business\nperformance.\nCompetition — For our businesses with medium- or long-term contracts, there is limited competition during the term of the contract.

This regulation sets the framework for the prices (\"tariffs\") that our utilities are allowed to charge customers for\nelectricity and establishes service standards that we are required to meet.\nOur utilities are generally permitted to earn a regulated rate of return on assets, determined by the regulator based on the utility's allowed\nregulatory asset base, capital structure and cost of capital. The asset base on which the utility is permitted a return is determined by the\nregulator, within the framework of applicable local laws, and is based on the amount of assets that are considered used and useful in serving\ncustomers. Both the allowed return and the asset base are important components of the utility's earning power. The allowed rate of return and\noperating expenses deemed reasonable by the regulator are recovered through the regulated tariff that the utility charges to its customers.\nThe tariff may be reviewed and reset by the regulator from time to time depending on local regulations, or the utility may seek a change in\nits tariffs. The tariff is generally based upon usage level and may include a pass-through of costs that are not controlled by the utility, such as the\ncosts of fuel (in the case of integrated utilities) and/or the costs of purchased energy, to the customer. Components of the tariff that are directly\npassed through to the\n\n\n9 | 2022 Annual Report\ncustomer are usually adjusted through a summary regulatory process or an existing formula-based mechanism. In some regulatory regimes,\ncustomers with demand above an established level are unregulated and can choose to contract directly with the utility or with other retail energy\nsuppliers and pay non-bypassable fees, which are fees to the distribution company for use of its distribution system.\nThe regulated tariff generally recognizes that our utility businesses should recover certain operating and fixed costs, as well as manage\nuncollectible amounts, quality of service and technical and non-technical losses. Utilities, therefore, need to manage costs to the levels reflected\nin the tariff, or risk non-recovery of costs or diminished returns.\nSeasonality, Weather Variations, and Economic Activity — Our utility businesses are generally affected by seasonal weather patterns and,\ntherefore, operating margin is not generated evenly throughout the year.

Those\nstandards may be explicit, with defined performance incentives or penalties, or implicit, where the utility must operate to meet customer and/or\nregulator expectations.\nDevelopment and Construction\nWe develop and construct new generation facilities. For our utility business, new plants may be built or existing plants retrofitted in\nresponse to customer needs or to comply with regulatory developments. The projects are developed subject to regulatory approval that permits\nrecovery of our capital cost and a return on our investment. For our generation businesses, our priority for development is in key growth markets,\nwhere we can leverage our global scale and synergies with our existing businesses by adding renewable energy. We make the decision to invest\nin new projects by evaluating the strategic fit, project returns and financial profile against a fair risk-adjusted return for the investment and against\nalternative uses of capital, including corporate debt repayment.\nIn some cases, we enter into long-term contracts for output from new facilities prior to commencing construction. To limit required equity\ncontributions from The AES Corporation, we also seek non-recourse project debt financing and other sources of capital, including partners, when\nit is commercially attractive. We typically contract with a third party to manage construction, although our construction management team\nsupervises the construction work and tracks progress against the project's budget and the required safety, efficiency and productivity standards.\nSegments\nThe segment reporting structure uses the Company's management reporting structure as its foundation to reflect how the Company\nmanages the businesses internally and is mainly organized by geographic regions which provides a socio-political-economic understanding of\nour business.\nWe are organized into four market-oriented SBUs: US and Utilities (United States, Puerto Rico and El Salvador); South America (Chile,\nColombia, Argentina and Brazil); MCAC (Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean); and Eurasia (Europe and Asia) — which are led by our\nSBU Presidents.

AES Indiana is an integrated utility that\nis engaged primarily in generating, transmitting, distributing, and selling electric energy to retail customers in the city of Indianapolis and\nneighboring areas within the state of Indiana and is subject to regulatory authority—see Regulatory Framework and Market Structure below. AES\nIndiana has an exclusive right to provide electric service to the customers in its service area, covering about 528 square miles with an estimated\npopulation of approximately 971,000 people. AES Indiana owns and operates four generating stations, all within the state of Indiana. AES\nIndiana’s largest generating station, Petersburg, is coal-fired. AES Indiana retired 230 MW Petersburg Unit 1 on May 31, 2021 and has plans to\nretire 415 MW Petersburg Unit 2 in 2023, which would result in 630 MW of total retired economic capacity at this station. AES Indiana plans to\nconvert the remaining two coal units at Petersburg to natural gas by the end of 2025 (see Integrated Resource Plan below). The second largest\nstation, Harding Street, uses natural gas and fuel oil to power combustion turbines. In addition, AES Indiana operates a 20 MW battery-based\nenergy storage unit at this location, which provides frequency response. The third",

The fourth\nstation, Georgetown, is a small peaking station that uses natural gas to power combustion turbines. In addition, AES Indiana helps meet its\ncustomers' energy needs with long-term contracts for the purchase of 300 MW of wind-generated electricity and 94 MW of solar-generated\nelectricity. In July 2021, AES Indiana executed an agreement to acquire a 250 MW solar and 180 MWh energy storage facility (the \"Petersburg\nSolar Project\"). As amended in October 2022 and subject to IURC approval, the Petersburg Solar Project is now expected to be completed in\n2025. In December 2021, AES Indiana completed the acquisition of Hardy Hills Solar Energy LLC, including the development of a 195 MW solar\nproject (the \"Hardy Hills Solar Project\"). As amended in December 2022 and subject to IURC approval, the Hardy Hills Solar Project is now\nexpected to be completed in 2024.\nKey Financial Drivers — AES Indiana's financial results are driven primarily by retail demand, weather, and maintenance costs. In addition,\nAES Indiana's financial results are likely to be driven by many other factors including, but not limited to:\n•\nregulatory outcomes and impacts;\n\n\n16 | 2022 Annual Report\n•\nthe passage of new legislation, implementation of regulations, or other changes in regulation; and\n•\ntimely recovery of capital expenditures.\nRegulatory Framework and Market Structure — AES Indiana is subject to comprehensive regulation by the IURC with respect to its\nservices and facilities, retail rates and charges, the issuance of long-term securities, and certain other matters. The regulatory authority of the\nIURC over AES Indiana's business is typical of regulation generally imposed by state public utility commissions. The IURC sets tariff rates for\nelectric service provided by AES Indiana. The IURC considers all allowable costs for ratemaking purposes, including a fair return on assets used\nand useful to providing service to customers.\nAES Indiana's tariff rates for electric service to retail customers consist of basic rates and approved charges. In addition, AES Indiana's\nrates include various adjustment mechanisms, including, but not limited to: (i) a rider to reflect changes in fuel and purchased power costs to\nmeet AES Indiana's retail load requirements, referred to as the Fuel Adjustment Charge, (ii) a rider for the timely recovery of costs incurred to\ncomply with environmental laws and regulations, including a return, (iii) a rider to reflect changes in ongoing RTO costs, (iv) riders for passing\nthrough to customers wholesale sales margins and capacity sales above and below established annual benchmarks, (v) a rider for a return on,\nand of, investments for eligible TDSIC improvements, and (vi) a rider for cost recovery, lost margin recoveries and performance incentives from\nAES Indiana's demand side management energy efficiency programs.

Additionally, AES Indiana's rider recoveries are reviewed through recurring filings.\nOn October 31, 2018, the IURC issued an order approving an uncontested settlement agreement to increase AES Indiana's annual\nrevenues by $44 million, or 3% (the \"2018 Base Rate Order\"). This revenue increase primarily includes recovery through rates of costs\nassociated with the CCGT at Eagle Valley, completed in the first half of 2018, and other construction projects. New base rates and charges\nbecame effective on December 5, 2018. The 2018 Base Rate Order was AES Indiana's most recent base rate order and also provided\ncustomers with approximately $50 million in benefits through a rate adjustment mechanism over a two-year period.\nAES Indiana is one of many transmission system owner members in MISO, an RTO which maintains functional control over the combined\ntransmission systems of its members and manages one of the largest energy and ancillary services markets in the U.S. MISO dispatches\ngeneration assets in economic order considering transmission constraints and other reliability issues to meet the total demand in the MISO\nregion. AES Indiana offers electricity in the MISO day-ahead and real-time markets.\nDevelopment Strategy — AES Indiana's construction program is composed of capital expenditures necessary for prudent utility operations\nand compliance with environmental regulations, along with discretionary investments designed to replace aging equipment or improve overall\nperformance.\nSenate Enrolled Act 560, the Transmission, Distribution, and Storage System Improvement Charge (\"TDSIC\") statute, provides for cost\nrecovery outside of a base rate proceeding for new or replacement electric and gas transmission, distribution, and storage projects that a public\nutility undertakes for the purposes of safety, reliability, system modernization, or economic development. Provisions of the TDSIC statute require\nthat requests for recovery include a plan of at least five years and not more than seven for eligible investments. Once a plan is approved by the\nIURC, eighty percent of eligible costs can be recovered using a periodic rate adjustment mechanism, referred to as a TDSIC mechanism.\nRecoverable costs include a return on, and of, the investment, including AFUDC, post-in-service carrying charges, operation and maintenance\nexpenses, depreciation, and property taxes. The remaining twenty percent of recoverable costs are deferred for future recovery in the public\nutility’s next base rate case. The TDSIC mechanism is capped at an annual increase of two percent of total retail revenues.\nOn March 4, 2020, the IURC issued an order approving the projects in AES Indiana's seven-year TDSIC Plan for eligible transmission,\ndistribution, and storage system improvements totaling $1.2 billion from 2020 thr",

AES Ohio is a utility company that transmits\nand distributes electricity to approximately 536,000 retail customers in a 6,000 square mile area of West Central Ohio and is subject to regulatory\nauthority—see Regulatory Framework and Market Structure below. AES Ohio has the exclusive right to provide transmission and distribution\nservices to its customers, and procures retail standard service offer (\"SSO\") electric service on behalf of residential, commercial, industrial, and\ngovernmental customers through a competitive bid auction process. In previous years, AES Ohio Generation was also a primary subsidiary, but\nDPL has systematically exited this generation business. AES Ohio Generation retired and sold its last remaining operating asset in 2020.\nKey Financial Drivers — AES Ohio's financial results are driven primarily by retail demand and weather. AES Ohio's financial results are\nlikely to be driven by other factors as well, including, but not limited to:\n•\nregulatory outcomes and impacts;\n•\nthe passage of new legislation, implementation of regulations, or other changes in regulations; and\n•\ntimely recovery of transmission and distribution expenditures.\nRegulatory Framework and Market Structure — AES Ohio is regulated by the PUCO for its distribution services and facilities, retail rates\nand charges, reliability of service, compliance with renewable energy portfolio requirements, energy efficiency program requirements, and\ncertain other matters. The PUCO maintains jurisdiction over the delivery of electricity, SSO, and other retail electric services.\nElectric customers within Ohio are permitted to purchase power under contract from a Competitive Retail Electric Service (\"CRES\")\nprovider or from their local utility under SSO rates. The SSO generation supply is provided by third parties through a competitive bid process.\nOhio utilities have the exclusive right to provide transmission and distribution services in their state-certified territories. While Ohio allows\ncustomers to choose retail generation providers, AES Ohio is required to provide retail generation service at SSO rates to any customer that has\nnot signed a contract with a CRES provider or as a provider of last resort in the event of a CRES provider default. SSO rates are subject to rules\nand regulations of the PUCO and are established through a competitive bid process for the supply of power to SSO customers.\nAES Ohio's distribution rates are regulated by the PUCO and are established through a traditional cost-based rate-setting process. AES\nOhio is permitted to recover its costs of providing distribution service as well as earn a regulated rate of return on assets, determined by the\nregulator, based on the utility's allowed regulated asset base, capital structure, and cost of capital.

In December 2020, an uncontested settlement was reached regarding these rates and filed with the FERC. It was approved on\nApril 15, 2021.\nAES Ohio is a member of PJM, an RTO that operates the transmission systems owned by utilities operating in all or parts of a multi-state\nregion, including Ohio. PJM also administers the day-ahead and real-time energy markets, ancillary services market and forward capacity\nmarket for its members.\nOhio law requires utilities to file either an Electric Security Plan (\"ESP\") or MRO plan to establish SSO rates. On December 18, 2019, the\nPUCO approved AES Ohio's Notice of Withdrawal and reversion to its prior rate plan (ESP 1). Among other items, the PUCO Order approving\nthe ESP 1 rate plan includes reinstating the non-bypassable RSC Rider, which provides annual revenues of approximately $79 million. The OCC\nhas appealed to the Ohio Supreme Court, the Commission’s decision approving the reversion to ESP 1 as well as argued for a refund of the\nRate Stabilization Charge (\"RSC\") revenues dating back to August 2021. A decision is pending. We are unable to predict the outcome of this\nappeal, but if this results in terms that are more adverse than AES Ohio's current ESP rate plan, it could have a material adverse effect on our\nresults of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOn September 26, 2022, AES Ohio filed its latest ESP (\"ESP 4\") with the PUCO. ESP 4 is a comprehensive plan to enhance and upgrade\nits network and improve service reliability, provide greater safeguards for price stability and continue investments in local economic development.\nAs part of this plan, AES Ohio intends to increase investments in the distribution infrastructure and deploy a proactive vegetation management\nprogram. The plan also includes proposals for new customer programs, including renewable options, electric vehicle programs and energy\nefficiency programs for residential and low-income customers. ESP 4 also seeks to recover outstanding regulatory assets not currently in rates.\nAES Ohio did not propose that the Rate Stabilization Charge would continue as part of ESP 4. The plan requires PUCO approval, which we\nanticipate in 2023.\nOn November 30, 2020, AES Ohio filed a new distribution rate case application with the PUCO to increase AES Ohio’s base rates for\nelectric distribution service to address, in part, increased costs of materials and labor and substantial investments to improve distribution\nstructures.

AES Clean Energy has a 5.2 GW backlog of projects, the majority of which are expected to come online\nthrough 2025. The adoption of the Inflation Reduction Act (\"IRA\") in 2022 is expected to be a significant accelerant to the growth of the U.S.\nrenewables market and AES plans to meet this demand with its 51 GW development pipeline.\nAES Clean Energy comprises AES Renewable Holdings, sPower, AES Clean Energy Development (\"ACED\"), and other renewable assets,\nas part of its broader investments in the U.S. ACED was formed on February 1, 2021, as specifically identified projects in the sPower and AES\nRenewable Holdings development platforms were merged. ACED serves as the development vehicle for all future renewable projects in the U.S.\nFollowing the merger, ACED expanded through the acquisitions of the Valcour Intermediate Holdings wind platform and Community Energy, a\nU.S. solar developer. AES Clean Energy has also grown organically at a rapid pace and now has more than 1,000 employees, in contrast to less\nthan 500 employees at the time of its formation in 2021. During the same time period, the development pipeline has also more than doubled.\nIn line with AES' strategy of using partnerships to promote the effective deployment of capital, in February 2023, the Company sold 49% of\nits indirect interest in a 1.3 GW portfolio of sPower's operating assets (\"OpCo B\") that includes 17 solar projects and one wind project, located\nacross six states, to Hannon Armstrong Sustainable Infrastructure Capital, Inc.\nKey Financial Drivers — The financial results of AES Clean Energy are primarily driven by the efficient construction and operation of\nrenewable energy facilities across th",

In 2022, AES recognized $246 million of pre-tax contribution related to the allocation of tax credits to tax equity partners of U.S.\nrenewables projects. The financial results of U.S. renewable assets are primarily driven by the amount of wind or solar resource at the facilities,\navailability of facilities, growth in projects, and by tax credit recognition once placed in service.\nA majority of solar projects under AES Clean Energy have been financed with tax equity structures.

The principal markets and locations where we are\nengaged in the generation and supply of electricity (energy and capacity) are the California Independent System Operator (\"CAISO\"), PJM, and\nPuerto Rico. AES Southland, operating in the CAISO, is our most significant generation business. AES Hawaii previously operated a coal plant\nunder a PPA. The PPA expired and the plant was retired in the third quarter of 2022.\nMany of our non-renewable U.S. generation plants provide baseload operations and are required to maintain a guaranteed level of\navailability. Any change in availability has a direct impact on financial performance. Some plants are eligible for availability bonuses if they meet\ncertain requirements. Coal and natural gas are used as the primary fuels. Coal prices are set by market factors internationally, while natural gas\nprices are generally set domestically. Recently we have seen international impacts on domestic gas prices (Henry Hub) due to the large amount\nof U.S. natural gas that can be exported through the liquefaction plants that have come online in recent years. Price variations for these fuels\ncan change the composition of generation costs and energy prices in our generation businesses.\nThe generation businesses with PPAs have mechanisms to recover fuel costs from the offtaker, including an energy payment partially\nbased on the market price of fuel. When market price fluctuations in fuel are borne by the offtaker, revenue may change as fuel prices fluctuate,\nbut the variable margin or profitability should remain consistent. These businesses often have an opportunity to increase or decrease profitability\nfrom payments under their PPAs depending on such items as plant efficiency and availability, heat rate, and fuel flexibility.\nWarrior Run currently operates as a QF, as defined under the PURPA.

In the northern region of the SEN, which includes the Atacama Desert,\nthermoelectric capacity represents the majority of installed capacity. The fuels used for thermoelectric generation, mainly coal, diesel, and LNG,\nare indexed to international prices. In 2022, the installed generation capacity in the Chilean market was composed of 42% thermoelectric, 23%\nhydroelectric, 20% solar, 13% wind, and 2% other fuel sources.\nHydroelectric plants represent a significant portion of the system's installed capacity. Precipitation and snow melt impact hydrological\nconditions in Chile. Rain occurs principally from June to August and snow melt occurs from September to December. These factors affect\ndispatch of the system's hydroelectric and thermoelectric generation plants, thereby influencing spot market prices.\nThe Ministry of Energy has primary responsibility for the Chilean electricity system directly or through the National Energy Commission and\nthe Superintendency of Electricity and Fuels.\nAll generators can sell energy through contracts with regulated distribution companies or directly to unregulated customers. Unregulated\ncustomers are customers whose connected capacity is higher than 5 MW. Customers with connected capacity between 0.5 MW and 5 MW can\nopt for regulated or unregulated contracts for a minimum period of four years. By law, both regulated and unregulated customers are required to\npurchase all electricity under contracts.

AES Andes continues\nto work under the Green Blend strategy to accelerate the phase-out of the remaining two coal-fired plants.\nEnvironmental Regulation — Chilean law requires all electricity generators to supply a certain portion of their total contractual obligations\nwith non-conventional renewable energy (\"NCRE\"). Generation companies are able to meet this requirement by building NCRE generation\ncapacity (wind, solar, biomass, geothermal, and small hydroelectric technology) or purchasing NCREs from qualified generators. Non-\ncompliance with the NCRE requirements will result in fines. AES Andes currently fulfills the NCRE requirements by utilizing AES Andes' solar,\nwind, and biomass power plants.\nSince 2017, emissions of particulate matter, SO , NO , and CO  are monitored for plants with an installed capacity over 50 MW; these\nemissions are taxed. In the case of CO , the tax is equivalent to $5 per ton emitted. Certain PPAs have clauses allowing the Company to pass\nthe green tax costs to unregulated customers, while some distribution PPAs do not allow for the pass through of these costs. During 2021, the\nChilean General Water Direction, as part of the Ministry of Public Works, established the obligation to install and maintain effective monitoring\nsystems for water withdrawal. We are currently implementing these systems in the power plants for which they are required.\nDuring 2022, new regulations associated with monitoring requirements were published, including Law 21,455, which is the framework on\nclimate change; the new Ventanas power plant Operational Plan; emission standards for back up generators; and recently enacted Law 21,505,\nwhich promotes electric energy storage and electromobility.

As part of this commitment, there are several projects under construction to supply agreements with its\nmain mining customers in execution of the new Green Blend strategy by integrating renewable energy sources into its portfolio, and by providing\ncontracting options that contain a mix of both renewable and nonrenewable solutions. In total, the pipeline currently has 4.2 GW under\ndevelopment at different stages and diversified geographically.\nWithin this portfolio, the Company has made significant progress in the development of NCRE projects that are already contracted. In the\nBiobío region, the Rinconada wind project (258 MW) is being developed, and in Antofagasta, a new expansion of the Andes Solar power plant is\nbeing developed, which will include a battery system to optimize solar generation (186 MW + 186 MW-5hr).\nIn addition, Empresa Eléctrica Angamos, a subsidiary of AES Andes, submitted for environmental processing a worldwide pioneering\ninitiative, referred to as the Alba project, that seeks an alternative for the conversion of thermoelectric plants through the use of molten salts. This\nproject explores the possibility of replacing the current coal-fired generation of units 1 and 2 of the Angamos thermoelectric power plant, located\nin Mejillones, Antofagasta region, with a molten salt system. With this technology, renewable energy is stored as heat to later be used to provide\nenergy and emission-free capacity to the electrical system.\n2\nX\n2\n2\n\n\n31 | 2022 Annual Report\nEmpresa Eléctrica Angamos is also promoting the advancement of green hydrogen technology for mass production through the Adelaida\nproject, which involves the installation of a low-scale green hydrogen production plant with a capacity of 1,000 kg/day of green hydrogen,\nequivalent to 2.5 MW of power.\nColombia\nBusiness Description — We operate in Colombia th",

AES Colombia’s installed\ncapacity accounted for approximately 6% of system capacity at the end of 2022. AES Colombia is dependent on hydrological conditions, which\ninfluence generation and spot prices of non-contracted generation in Colombia.\nAES Colombia's commercial strategy aims to execute contracts with commercial and industrial customers and bid in public tenders, mainly\nwith distribution companies, in order to reduce margin volatility with proper portfolio risk management. The remaining energy generated by our\nportfolio is sold to the spot market, including ancillary services. Additionally, AES Colombia receives reliability payments for maintaining the\nplant's availability and generating firm energy during periods of power scarcity, such as adverse hydrological conditions, in order to prevent\npower shortages.\nKey Financial Drivers — Hydrological conditions largely influence Chivor's power generation. Maintaining the appropriate contract level,\nwhile maximizing revenue through the sale of excess generation, is key to AES Colombia's results of operations. In addition to hydrology,\nfinancial results are driven by many factors, including, but not limited to:\n•\nforced outages;\n•\nfluctuations of the Colombian peso; and\n•\nspot market prices.\nRegulatory Framework and Market Structure — Electricity supply in Colombia is concentrated in one main system, the SIN, which\nencompasses one-third of Colombia's territory, providing electricity to 97% of the country's population. The SIN's installed capacity, primarily\nhydroelectric (67%), other renewable (3%) and thermal (30%), totaled 18,771 MW as of December 31, 2022. The marked seasonal variations in\nColombia's hydrology result in price volatility in the short-term market. In 2022, 84% of total energy demand was supplied by hydroelectric\nplants.\nThe electricity sector in Colombia operates under a competitive market framework for the generation and sale of electricity, and a regulated\nframework for transmission and distribution of electricity. The distinct activities of the electricity sector are governed by Colombian laws and\nCREG, the Colombian regulating entity for energy and gas. Other government entities have a role in the electricity industry, including the Ministry\nof Mines and Energy, which defines the government's policy for the energy sector; the Public Utility Superintendency of Colombia, which is in\ncharge of overseeing utility companies; and the Mining and Energy Planning Unit, which is in charge of expansion planning of the generation and\ntransmission network.\nThe generation sector is organized on a competitive basis with companies sellin",

As of\nDecember 31, 2022, the installed capacity of the SADI totaled 42,927 MW. The SADI's installed capacity is composed primarily of thermoelectric\ngeneration (59%) and hydroelectric generation (26%), as well as wind (8%), nuclear (4%), and solar (3%).\nThermoelectric generation in the SADI is primarily natural gas. However, scarcity of natural gas during winter periods (June to August) due\nto transport constraints result in the use of alternative fuels, such as oil and coal. The SADI is also highly reliant on hydroelectric plants.\nHydrological conditions impact reservoir water levels and largely influence the dispatch of the system's hydroelectric and thermoelectric\ngeneration plants and, therefore, influence market costs. Precipitation in Argentina occurs principally from May to October.\nThe Argentine regulatory framework divides the electricity sector into generation, transmission, and distribution. The wholesale electric\nmarket is comprised of generation companies, transmission companies, distribution companies, and large customers who are permitted to trade\nelectricity. Generation companies can sell their output in the spot market or under PPAs. CAMMESA manages the electricity market and is\nresponsible for dispatch coordination. The Electricity National Regulatory Agency is in charge of regulating public service activities and the\nSecretariat of Energy regulates system framework and grants concessions or authorizations for sector activities. In Argentina, there is a tolling\nscheme in which the regulator establishes prices for electricity and defines fuel reference prices. As a result, our businesses are particularly\nsensitive to changes in regulation.\nThe Argentine electric market is an \"average cost\" system. Generators are compensated for fixed costs and non-fuel variable costs, under\nprices denominated in Argentine pesos. CAMMESA is in charge of providing the natural gas and liquid fuels required by the generation\ncompanies, except for coal.\nThe expansion of renewable capacity in the system is promoted by allowing the new power plants to sign contracts either with CAMMESA\nthrough the RenovAr program or directly by trading energy in the private market.\nDuring 2022, although the government increased prices to the end user, subsidies and the system deficit also increased. By December\n2022, distribution companies recovered an average 40% of the total cost of the system.\nIn past years, AES Argentina contributed certain accounts receivable to fund the construction of three power plants under FONINVEMEM\nagreements.

This law\nset an objective of 8% renewable energy by 2017 and 20% by 2025 and also introduced tax exemptions for importing equipment used in the\nconstruction of renewable energy projects in addition to other tax benefits. This framework fostered AES Argentina's construction of Vientos\nBonaerenses and Vientos Neuquinos power plants, which are fully contracted with national and private customers in the long term.\nIn December 2019, Law 27,520 established a minimum budget to grant adequate actions, instruments, and strategies to mitigate and\nadapt to global climate change effects in all national territories and created the National Office of Climate Change to designate private and public\nactors to design policies aiming to reduce greenhouse gases and to provide coordinated responses in sectors that are vulnerable to climate\nchange impacts.\nAll AES Argentina plants are certified under international standards of Quality (ISO 9001), Safety and Health (ISO 45.001) and\nEnvironment (ISO 14001).\nDevelopment Strategy — Leveraging existing wind operating facilities in southern Buenos Aires and market opportunities, AES Argentina is\ndeveloping 890 MW of wind greenfield projects that are in mid-to-late stages of development and could be funded locally.

The ONS dispatches generators based on their marginal cost of production and on the risk of system rationing. Key variables for the\ndispatch decision are forecasted hydrological conditions, reservoir levels, electricity demand, fuel prices, and thermal generation availability.\nIn case of unfavorable hydrology, the ONS will reduce hydroelectric dispatch to preserve reservoir levels and increase dispatch of thermal\nplants to meet demand. The consequences of unfavorable hydrology are (i) higher energy spot prices due to higher energy production costs at\nthermal plants and (ii) the need for hydro plants to purchase energy in the spot market to fulfill their contractual obligations.\nA mechanism known as the MRE (Energy Reallocation Mechanism) was created under ONS to share hyd",

Furthermore, AES operates an LNG regasification facility, a 180,000 cubic meter storage tank, and a truck\nloading facility.\nThe majority of our hydroelectric plants in Panama are based on run-of-the-river technology, with the exception of 223 MW Changuinola\nplant with regulation reservoirs and the 260 MW Bayano plant. Hydrological conditions have an important influence on profitability. Variations in\nhydrology can result in an excess or a shortfall in energy production relative to our contractual obligations. Hydro generation is generally in a\nshortfall position during the dry season from January through May, which is offset by thermal and wind generation since its behavior is opposite\nand complementary to hydro generation.\nOur hydro and thermal assets are mainly contracted through medium to long-term PPAs with distribution companies. A small volume of our\nhydro plants are contracted with unregulated users. Our hydro assets in Panama have PPAs with distribution companies expiring up to\nDecember 2030 for a total contracted capacity of 377 MW. Our thermal asset in Panama has PPAs with distribution companies for a total\ncontracted capacity of 350 MW expiring in August 2028, which matches the term of the LNG supply agreement of such thermal assets.

The Company is currently required to comply with the CSAPR in Indiana and Maryland. The CSAPR is implemented in part through a\nmarket-based program under which compliance may be achievable through the acquisition and use of emissions allowances created by the\nEPA. The Company complies with CSAPR through operation of existing controls and purchases of allowances on the open market, as needed.\nIn October 2016, the EPA published a final rule to update the CSAPR to address the 2008 ozone NAAQS (\"CSAPR Update Rule\"). The\nCSAPR Update Rule found that NO  ozone season emissions in 22 states (including Indiana and Maryland, and Ohio) affect the ability of\ndownwind states to attain and maintain the 2008 ozone NAAQS, and, accordingly, the EPA issued federal implementation plans that both\nupdated existing CSAPR NO  ozone season emission budgets for electric generating units within these states and implemented these budgets\nthrough modifications to the CSAPR NO  ozone season allowance trading program. Implementation began in the 2017 ozone season and\naffected facilities began to receive fewer ozone season NO  allowances in 2017. Following legal challenges related to the CSAPR Update Rule,\non April 30, 2021, EPA issued the Revised CSAPR Update Rule. The Revised CSAPR Update Rule required affected EGUs within certain states\n(including Indiana and Maryland) to participate in a new trading program, the CSAPR NO  Ozone Season Group 3 trading program. These\naffected EGUs received fewer ozone season NO  Ozone Season allowances beginning in 2021, which may result in the need for AES affected\nfacilitites to purchase additional allowances.\n2\nx\n2\nX\n2\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nx\nx\n\n\n50 | 2022 Annual Report\nOn April 6, 2022, the EPA published a proposed Federal Implementation Plan (\"FIP\") to address air quality impacts with respect to the 2015\nOzone NAAQS.

In addition to other requirements, if finalized, EGUs in these states would begin receiving fewer allowances as soon as 2023, which\nmay result in the need to purchase additional allowances.\nWhile the Company's additional CSAPR compliance costs to date have been immaterial, the future availability of and cost to purchase\nallowances to meet the emission reduction requirements is uncertain at this time, but it could be material if certain facilities will need to purchase\nadditional allowances based on reduced allocations.\nNew Sou",

There is ongoing uncertainty and significant litigation regarding which projects fall within the RMRR exclusion. Over the\npast several years, the EPA has filed suits against coal-fired power plant owners and issued NOVs to a number of power plant owners alleging\nNSR violations. See Item 3.—Legal Proceedings in this Form 10-K for more detail with respect to environmental litigation and regulatory action,\nincluding an NOV issued by the EPA against AES Indiana concerning NSR and prevention of significant deterioration issues under the CAA.

Circuit due to the EPA’s failure to consider costs before deciding to\nregulate power plants under Section 112 of the CAA and subsequently remanded MATS to the EPA without vacatur. On May 22, 2020, the EPA\npublished a final finding that it is not “appropriate and necessary” to regulate hazardous air pollutant emissions from coal- and oil-fired electric\ngenerating units (EGUs) (reversing its prior 2016 finding), but that the EPA would not remove the source category from the CAA Section 112(c)\nlist of source categories and would not change the MATS requirements. Several petitioners filed for judicial review of the final finding and the\nD.C. Circuit, on February 16, 2021, granted the EPA's request that the rule be held in abeyance pending the EPA's review.

The final ACE Rule established CO emission rules for existing power plants\nunder CAA Section 111(d) and replaced the EPA's 2015 Clean Power Plan Rule (CPP). In accordance with the ACE Rule, the EPA determined\nthat heat rate improvement measures are the best system of emissions reductions for existing coal-fired electric generating units. The final rule\nrequired states, including Indiana and Maryland, to develop a State Plan to establish CO  emission limits for designated facilities, including AES\nIndiana Petersburg's and AES Warrior Run's coal-fired electric generating units.

AES\nopposed the action and the court granted an order dismissing the matter. The case remains open subject to the resolution of counter claims\nbetween parties other than AES. Plaintiffs have initiated an additional challenge to the permit, and the outcome of that lawsuit is unclear. On\nMarch 16, 2021 the SACCWIS released their draft 2021 report to SWRCB. The report summarizes the State of California’s current electrical grid\nreliability needs and recommended a two-year extension to the compliance schedule for AES Redondo Beach to address system-wide grid\nreliability needs. The SWRCB public hearing regarding the final decision on the amendment of the OTC policy was held on October 19, 2021\nand the Board voted in favor of extending the compliance date for AES Redondo Beach to December 31, 2023. The AES Redondo Beach\nNPDES\n\n\n53 | 2022 Annual Report\npermit has been administratively extended. On September 30, 2022, the Statewide Advisory Committee on Cooling Water Intake Structures\napproved a recommendation to the SWRCB to consider an extension of the OTC compliance dates for AES Huntington Beach, LLC and AES\nAlamitos, LLC, to December 31, 2026, in support of grid reliability. SWRCB released a draft OTC Policy amendment early in 2023 to be heard by\nthe SWRCB on March 7, 2023. The final decision from SWRCB is expected during the second half of 2023.\nPower plants are required to comply with the more stringent of state or federal requirements. At present, the California state requirements\nare more stringent and have earlier compliance dates than the federal EPA requirements, and are therefore applicable to the Company's\nCalifornia assets.\nChallenges to the federal EPA's rule were filed and consolidated in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, although\nimplementation of the rule was not stayed while the challenges proceeded. On July 23, 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit\nupheld the rule. The Second Circuit later denied a petition by environmental groups for rehearing. The Company anticipates that compliance with\nCWA Section 316(b) regulations and associated costs could have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of\noperations.\nWater Discharges — In June 2015, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (\"the agencies\") published a rule defining federal\njurisdiction",

This rule, which initially became effective in August 2015,\ncould expand or otherwise change the number and types of waters or features subject to CWA permitting. However, after repealing the 2015\nWOTUS rule on October 22, 2019, the agencies, on April 21, 2020, issued the final “Navigable Waters Protection” (NWP) rule which again\nrevised the definition of waters of the U.S. On August 30, 2021, the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona issued an order vacating and\nremanding the NWP Rule. This vacatur of the NWP Rule applies nationwide. As such, the agencies again interpreted waters of the U.S.\nconsistent with the pre-2015 regulatory regime. On January 18, 2023, the Agencies published a final rule to define the scope of waters regulated\nunder the CWA. The rule restores regulations defining WOTUS that were in place prior to 2015, with updates intended to be consistent with\nrelevant Supreme Court decisions. On January 24, 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari on a wetlands case (Sackett v. EPA) on the\nlimited question of: “Whether the Ninth Circuit set forth the proper test for determining whether wetlands are ‘waters of the United States’ under\nthe Clean Water Act.” The Ninth Circuit employed Justice Kennedy’s “significant nexus” test from the 2006 Rapanos v. United States decision;\nthe plurality opinion in Rapanos required a water body to have a \"continuous surface connection\" with a water of the United States in order to be\nconsidered a wetland covered by the CWA. In Sackett v. EPA, the Court may finally provide clarity on which test from the 2006 Rapanos decision\ncontrols. It is too early to determine whether the newly promulgated NWP rule or any outcome of litigation may have a material impact on our\nbusiness, financial condition, or results of operations.\nIn November 2015, the EPA published its final ELG rule to reduce toxic pollutants discharged into waters of the U.S. by steam-electric\npower plants through technology applications. These effluent limitations for existing and new sources include dry handling of fly ash, closed-loop\nor dry handling of bottom ash, and more stringent effluent limitations for flue gas desulfurization wastewater. AES Indiana Petersburg has\ninstalled a dry bottom ash handling system in response to the CCR rule and wastewater treatment systems in response to the NPDES permits in\nadvance of the ELG compliance date. Other U.S. businesses already include dry handling of fly ash and bottom ash and do not generate flue\ngas desulfurization wastewater. However, it is too early to determine whether any outcome of litigation or current or future revisions to the ELG\nrule might have a material impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOn April 23, 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision in the Hawaii Wildlife Fund v.

The rule established nationally applicable minimum criteria for the disposal of CCR in new and\ncurrently operating landfills and surface impoundments, including location restrictions, design and operating criteria, groundwater monitoring,\ncorrective action and closure requirements, and post-closure care. The 2016 Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act (\"WIN Act\")\nincludes provisions to implement the CCR rule through a state permitting program, or if the state chooses not to participate, a possible federal\npermit program. On February 20, 2020, the EPA published a proposed rule to establish a federal CCR permit program that would operate in\nstates without approved CCR permit programs. If this rule is finalized before Indiana or Puerto Rico establishes a state-level CCR permit\nprogram, AES CCR units in those locations could eventually be required to apply for a federal CCR permit from the EPA.

We maintain an amount of insurance\nprotection that we believe is customary, but there can be no assurance it will be sufficient or effective in light of all circumstances, hazards or\nliabilities to which we may be subject. Our insurance does not cover every potential risk associated with our operations. Adequate coverage at\nreasonable rates is not always obtainable. In particular, the availability of insurance for coal-fired generation assets has decreased as certain\ninsurers have opted to discontinue or limit offering insurance for such assets.

Some of these business lines are dependent upon favorable\nregulatory incentives to support continued investment, and there is significant uncertainty about the extent to which such favorable regulatory\nincentives will be available in the future. In particular, in the U.S., AES’ renewable energy generation growth strategy depends in part on federal,\nstate and local government policies and incentives that support the development, financing, ownership and operation of renewable energy\ngeneration projects, including investment tax credits, production tax credits, accelerated depreciation, renewable portfolio standards, feed-in-\ntariffs and similar programs, renewable energy credit mechanisms, and tax exemptions.

For our wind projects, wind resource estimates are based on historical experience when available and on wind\nresource studies conducted by an independent engineer. These wind resource estimates are not expected to reflect actual wind energy\nproduction in any given year, but long-term averages of a resource.\nAs a result, these types of projects face considerable risk, including that favorable regulatory regimes expire or are adversely modified. At\nthe development or acquisition stage, our ability to predict actual performance results may be hindered and the projects may not perform as\npredicted.

Significant variations from normal weather where our businesses are located could have a material impact on our\nresults of operations.\nChanges in weather can also affect the production of electricity at power generation facilities, including, but not limited to, our wind and\nsolar facilities. For example, the level of wind resource affects the revenue produced by wind generation facilities. Because the levels of wind\nand solar resources are variable and difficult to predict, our results of operations for individual wind and solar facilities specifically, and our results\nof operations generally, may vary significantly from period to period, depending on the level of available resources.

The opinion held that the “generation shifting” approach in the CPP exceeded the authority granted to EPA by Congress under\nSection 111(d) of the CAA. As a result of the June 30, 2022 Supreme Court decision, on October 27, 2022, the D.C.

We anticipate that the Paris Agreement will continue the trend toward efforts to decarbonize the global economy and to\nfurther limit GHG emissions. The impact of GHG regulation on our operations will depend on a number of factors, including the degree and\ntiming of GHG emissions reductions required under any such legislation or regulation, the cost of emissions reduction equipment and the price\nand availability of offsets, the extent to which market based compliance options are available, the extent to which our subsidiaries would be\nentitled to receive GHG emissions allowances without having to purchase them in an auction or on the open market and the impact of such\nlegislation or regulation on the ability of our subsidiaries to recover costs incurred through rate increases or otherwise.

Since sPower does not have any ongoing development or other value creation activities\nfollowing the transfer of these activities to AES Clean Energy Development, the impairment adjusts the carrying value to the fair market value of\nthe operating assets.

Commerce also evaluated numerous individual companies and issued preliminary determinations that\ncircumvention had occurred with respect to many but not all of these companies. Additionally, Commerce issued a preliminary determination that\ncircumvention would not be deemed to occur for any solar cells and panels imported from the four countries if the wafers were manufactured\noutside of China or if no more than two out of six specifically identified components were produced in China. These preliminary determinations\ncould be modified and final determinations from Commerce are expected in May 2023. We have contracted and secured our expected\nrequirements for solar panels for U.S. projects targeted to achieve commercial operations in 2023.\nAdditionally, the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (“UFLPA”) seeks to block the import of products made with forced labor in certain\nareas of China and may lead to certain suppliers being blocked from importing solar cells and panels to the U.S. While this has impacted the\nU.S. market, AES has managed this issue without significant impact to our projects. Further disruptions may impact our suppliers’ ability or\nwillingness to meet their contractual agreements or to continue to supply cells or panels into the U.S. market on terms that we deem satisfactory.\nThe impact of any adverse Commerce determination, the impact of the UFLPA, future disruptions to the solar panel supply chain and their\neffect on AES’ U.S. solar project development and construction activities are uncertain. AES will continue to monitor developments and take\nprudent steps towards maintaining a robust supply chain for our renewable projects.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic — The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted global economic activity, including electricity and energy consumption,\nand caused significant volatility in financial markets intermittently in the last three years.

Additionally, we operate in multiple countries and as\nsuch are subject to volatility in exchange rates at the subsidiary level. See Item 7A.—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nfor further information.\nInflation Reduction Act and U.S. Renewable Energy Tax Credits — The Inflation Reduction Act (the “IRA”) was signed into law\nin the United States. The IRA includes provisions that are expected to benefit the U.S. clean energy industry, including increases, extensions\nand/or new tax credits for onshore and offshore wind, solar, storage and hydrogen projects. We expect that the extension of the current solar\ninvestment tax credits (\"ITCs\"), as well as higher credits available for projects that satisfy wage and apprenticeship requirements, will increase\ndemand for our renewables products.\nOur U.S. renewables business has a 51 GW pipeline that we intend to utilize to continue to grow our business, and these changes in tax\npolicy are supportive of this strategy. We account for U.S. renewables projects according to U.S. GAAP, which, when partnering with tax-equity\ninvestors to monetize tax benefits, utilizes the HLBV method. This method recognizes the tax-credit value that is transferred to tax equity\npartners at the time of its creation, which for projects utilizing the investment tax credit is in the quarter the project begins commercial operation.\nFor projects utilizing the production tax credit, this value is recognized over 10 years as the facility produces energy. In 2022, we\n\n\n103 | 2022 Annual Report\nrealized $246 million of Adjusted PTC from tax credits earned by our U.S. renewables business. In 2023, we expect to realize significantly\nincreased amounts of Adjusted PTC from tax credits earned by our U.S. renewables business in line with the growth in that business.

While that guidance is pending, there will be uncertainty with respect to the implementation of certain provisions of the IRA.\nGlobal Tax — The macroeconomic and political environments in the U.S. and in some countries where our subsidiaries conduct\nbusiness have changed during 2021 and 2022. This could result in significant impacts to tax law. For example, on July 1, 2022, the Chilean\ngovernment proposed to reduce the corporate tax rate from 27% to 25%, limit net operating loss utilization per year, and introduce a\ndisintegrated system whereby dividends may be subject to a 22% withholding tax, among other changes. The potential impact to the\nCompany may be material.\nIn the U.S., the IRA includes a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax based on adjusted financial statement income. We are currently\nevaluating the applicability and effect of the new law and additional guidance issued in the fourth quarter of 2022.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, the European Commission adopted an amended Directive on Pillar 2 establishing a global minimum tax at a\n15% rate. The adoption requires EU Member States to transpose the Directive into their respective national laws by December 31, 2023 for the\nrules to come into effect as of January 1, 2024. We will continue to monitor issuance of draft legislation in Bulgaria and other relevant EU\nMember States. The impact to the Company remains unknown but may be material.\nInflation — In the markets in which we operate, there have been higher rates of inflation recently. While most of our contracts in our\ninternational businesses are indexed to inflation, in general, our U.S.-based generation contracts are not indexed to inflation. If inflation\ncontinues to increase in our markets, it may increase our expenses that we may not be able to pass through to customers. It may also increase\nthe costs of some of our development projects that could negatively impact their competitiveness. Our utility businesses do allow for recovering\nof operations and maintenance costs through the regulatory process, which may have timing impacts on recovery.\nReference Rate Reform — In July 2017, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority announced that it intends to phase out\nLIBOR. In the U.S., the Alternative Reference Rate Committee at the Federal Reserve identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate\n(\"SOFR\") as its preferred alternative rate for LIBOR; alternative reference rates in other key markets are under development. The ICE\nBenchmark Association (\"IBA\") has determined that it will cease publication of the one-month, three-month, six-month, and 12-month USD\nLIBOR rates by June 30, 2023.

Despite the Title III protection, PREPA has been making\nsubstantially all of its payments to the generators in line with historical payment patterns.\nThe Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (“PROMESA”) was enacted to create a structure for exercising\nfederal oversight over the fiscal affairs of U.S. territories and created procedures for adjusting debt accumulated by the Puerto Rico government\nand, potentially, other territories (“Title III”). PROMESA also expedites the approval of key energy projects and other critical projects in Puerto\nRico.\nPROMESA allowed for the establishment of an Oversight Board with broad powers of budgetary and financial control over Puerto Rico. The\nOversight Board filed for bankruptcy on behalf of PREPA under Title III in July 2017.\n\n\n104 | 2022 Annual Report\nAs a result of the bankruptcy filing, AES Puerto Rico and AES Ilumina’s non-recourse debt of $143 million and $27 million, respectively, continue\nto be in technical default and are classified as current as of December 31, 2022. The Company is in compliance with its debt payment\nobligations as of December 31, 2022.\nOn April 12, 2022, a mediation team was appointed to prepare the plan to resolve the PREPA Title III case and related proceedings. A\ndisclosure statement hearing was held on February 28, 2023; the PREPA disclosure statement was approved and mediation was extended\nthrough April 28, 2023.\nConsidering the information available as of the filing date, management believes the carrying amount of our long-lived assets in Puerto Rico\nof $96 million is recoverable as of December 31, 2022.\nDecarbonization Initiatives\nOur strategy involves shifting towards clean energy platforms, including renewable energy, energy storage, LNG, and modernized grids.

No formal investigation has been launched by DG Comp to date. However, AES Maritza has been\nengaging in discussions with the DG Comp case team and the Government of Bulgaria (\"GoB\") to attempt to reach a negotiated resolution of the\nDG Comp’s review (\"PPA Discussions\"). The PPA Discussions are ongoing and the PPA continues to remain in place. However, there can be no\nassurance that, in the context of the PPA Discussions, the other parties will not seek a prompt termination of the PPA.\nWe do not believe termination of the PPA is justified. Nevertheless, the PPA Discussions involve a range of potential outcomes, including\nbut not limited to the termination of the PPA and payment of some level of compensation to AES Maritza. Any negotiated resolution would be\nsubject to mutually acceptable terms, lender consent, and DG Comp approval. At this time, we cannot predict the outcome of the PPA\nDiscussions or when those discussions will conclude. Nor can we predict how DG Comp might resolve its review if the PPA Discussions fail to\nresult in an agreement concerning the agency's review. AES Maritza believes that its PPA is legal and in compliance with all applicable laws, and\nit will take all actions necessary to protect its interests, whether through negotiated agreement or otherwise. However, there can be no\nassurance that this matter will be resolved favorably; if it is not, there could be a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition,\nresults of operation, and cash flows.

AES' significant accounting policies are described in Note 1—General and Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8.—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of\nthis Form 10-K.\nAn accounting estimate is considered critical if the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly\nuncertain at the time the estimate was made, different estimates reasonably could have been used, or the impact of the estimates and\nassumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material.\nManagement believes that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, actual\nresults could materially differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods. Management has discussed\nthese critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee, as appropriate. Listed below are the Company's most significant critical accounting\nestimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIncome Taxes — We are subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions.

The Company regularly assesses the potential outcome of these examinations in each tax jurisdiction when determining the adequacy of\nthe provision for income taxes. Accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes a more likely than not recognition threshold. Tax\nreserves have been established, which the Company believes to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments. Once\nestablished, reserves are adjusted only when there is more information available or when an event occurs necessitating a change to the\nreserves. While the Company believes that the amounts of the tax estimates are reasonable, it is possible that the ultimate outcome of current or\nfuture examinations may be materially different than the reserve amounts.\nBecause we have a wide range of statutory tax rates in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, any changes in our geographical\nearnings mix could materially impact our effective tax rate. Furthermore, our tax position could be adversely impacted by changes in tax laws,\ntax treaties or tax regulations, or the interpretation or enforcement thereof and such changes may be more likely or become more likely in view of\nrecent economic trends in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate.\n(1)\n\n\n118 | 2022 Annual Report\nIn addition, no taxes have been recorded on undistributed earnings for certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries to the extent such earnings are\nconsidered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries. Should the earnings be remitted as dividends, the Company may\nbe subject to additional foreign withholding and state income taxes.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement\ncarrying amounts of the existing assets and liabilities, and their respective income tax bases. The Company establishes a valuation allowance\nwhen it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company has elected to treat GILTI as an\nexpense in the period in which the tax is accrued. Accordingly, no deferred tax assets or liabilities are recorded related to GILTI.\nIn addition, the Company has elected an accounting policy not to consider the effects of being subject to the corporate alternative minimum\ntax in future periods when assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets, carryforwards, and tax credits. Any effect on the realization of\ndeferred tax assets will be recognized in the period they arise.\nImpairments — Our accounting policies on goodwill and long-lived assets, including events that lead to possible impairment, are\ndescribed in detail in Note 1—General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

The Company exercises judgment in determining if these indicators or events represent an impairment indicator requiring the\ncomputation of the fair value of goodwill and/or the recoverability of long-lived assets. The fair value determination is typically the most\njudgmental part in an impairment evaluation. Please see Fair Value below for further detail.\nAs part of the impairment evaluation process, management analyzes the sensitivity of fair value to various underlying assumptions. The\nlevel of scrutiny increases as the gap between fair value and carrying amount decreases. Changes in any of these assumptions could result in\nmanagement reaching a different conclusion regarding the potential impairment, which could be material. Our impairment evaluations inherently\ninvolve uncertainties from uncontrollable events that could positively or negatively impact the anticipated future economic and operating\nconditions.\nFurther discussion of the impairment charges recognized by the Company can be found within Note 9—Goodwill and Other Intangible\nAssets and Note 22—Asset Impairment Expense to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nDepreciation — Depreciation, after consideration of salvage value and asset retirement obligations, is computed using the straight-line\nmethod over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are determined on a composite or component basis. The Company considers many\nfactors in its estimate of useful lives, including expected usage, physical deterioration, technological changes, existence and length of off-taker\nagreements, and laws and regulations, among others. In certain circumstances, these estimates involve significant judgment and require\nmanagement to forecast the impact of relevant factors over an extended time horizon.\nUseful life estimates are continually evaluated for appropriateness as changes in the relevant factors arise, including when a long-lived\nasset group is tested for recoverability. Depreciation studies are performed periodically for assets subject to composite depreciation. Any change\nto useful lives is considered a change in accounting estimate and is made on a prospective basis.\nFair Value — For information regarding the fair value hierarchy, see Note 1—General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nincluded in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments — A significant number of the Company's financial instruments are carried at fair value with\nchanges in fair value recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income each period. Investments are generally fair valued based on quoted\nmarket prices or other observable market data such as interest rate indices.

In addition, the relevant accounting guidance requires the Company to recognize the\nmajority of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination and asset acquisitions by VIEs at fair value.\nThe Company may engage an independent valuation firm to assist management with the valuation. The Company generally utilizes the\nincome approach to value nonfinancial assets and liabilities, specifically a Discounted Cash Flow (\"DCF\") model to estimate fair value by\ndiscounting cash flow forecasts, adjusted to reflect market participant assumptions, to the extent necessary, at an appropriate discount rate.\nManagement applies considerable judgment in selecting several input assumptions during the development of our cash flow forecasts.\nExamples of the input assumptions that our forecasts are sensitive to include macroeconomic factors such as growth rates, industry demand,\ninflation, exchange rates, power prices, rising interest rates, and commodity prices. Whenever appropriate, management obtains these input\nassumptions from observable market data sources (e.g., Economic Intelligence Unit) and extrapolates the market information if an input\nassumption is not observable for the entire forecast period. Many of these input assumptions are dependent on other economic assumptions,\nwhich are often derived from statistical economic models with inherent limitations such as estimation differences. Further, several input\nassumptions are based on historical trends which often do not recur. It is not uncommon that different market data sources have different views\nof the macroeconomic factor expectations and related assumptions. As a result, macroeconomic factors and related assumptions are often\navailable in a narrow range; however, in some situations these ranges become wide and the use of a different set of input assumptions could\nproduce significantly different budgets and cash flow forecasts.\nA considerable amount of judgment is also applied in the estimation of the discount rate used in the DCF model. To the extent practical,\ninputs to the discount rate are obtained from market data sources (e.g., Bloomberg). The Company selects and uses a set of publicly traded\ncompanies from the relevant industry to estimate the discount rate inputs. Management applies judgment in the selection of such companies\nbased on its view of the most likely market participants. It is reasonably possible th",

We primarily use derivative instruments to manage our interest rate, commodity, and foreign currency\nexposures. We do not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes. See Note 6—Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nincluded in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information on the classification.\nThe fair value measurement standard requires the Company to consider and reflect the assumptions of market participants in the fair value\ncalculation. These factors include nonperformance risk (the risk that the obligation will not be fulfilled) and credit risk, both of the reporting entity\n(for liabilities) and of the counterparty (for assets). Credit risk for AES is evaluated at the level of the entity that is party to the contract.\nNonperformance risk on the Company's derivative instruments is an adjustment to the fair value position that is derived from internally developed\nvaluation models that utilize market inputs that may or may not be observable.\nAs a result of uncertainty, complexity, and judgment, accounting estimates related to derivative accounting could result in material changes\nto our financial statements under different conditions or utilizing different assumptions. As a part of accounting for these derivatives, we make\nestimates concerning nonperformance, volatilities, market liquidity, future commodity prices, interest rates, credit ratings, and future foreign\nexchange rates. Refer to Note 5—Fair Value included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional details.\nThe fair value of our derivative portfolio is generally determined using internal and third party valuation models, most of which are based on\nobservable market inputs, including interest rate curves and forward and spot prices for currencies and commodities. The Company derives\nmost of its financial instrument market assumptions from market efficient data sources (e.g., Bloomberg, Reuters, and Platt's). In some cases,\nwhere market data is not readily available, management uses comparable market sources and empirical evidence to derive market assumptions\nto determine a financial instrument's fair value. In certain instances, published pricing may not extend through the remaining term of the contract,\nand management must make assumptions to extrapolate the curve. Specifically, where there is limited forward curve data with respect to foreign\nexchange contracts beyond the traded points, the Company utilizes the interest rate differential approach to construct the remaining portion of\nthe forward curve.

If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, any asset write-offs would be required to be recognized in operating\nincome.\nConsolidation — The Company enters into transactions impacting the Company's equity interests in its affiliates. In connection with each\ntransaction, the Company must determine whether the transaction impacts the Company's consolidation conclusion by first determining whether\nthe transaction should be evaluated under the variable interest model or the voting model. In determining which consolidation model applies to\nthe transaction, the Company is required to make judgments about how the entity operates, the most significant of which are whether (i) the\nentity has sufficient equity to finance its activities, (ii) the equity holders, as a group, have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest,\nand (iii) whether the entity has non-substantive voting rights.\nIf the entity is determined to be a variable interest entity, the most significant judgment in determining whether the Company must\nconsolidate the entity is whether the Company, including its related parties and de facto agents, collectively have power and benefits. If AES is\ndetermined to have power and benefits, the entity will be consolidated by AES.\nAlternatively, if the entity is determined to be a voting model entity, the most significant judgments involve determining whether the non-AES\nshareholders have substantive participating rights. The assessment of shareholder rights and whether they are substantive participating rights\nrequires significant judgment since the rights provided under shareholders' agreements may include selecting, terminating, and setting the\ncompensation of management responsible for implementing the subsidiary's policies and procedures, and establishing operating and capital\ndecisions of the entity, including budgets, in the ordinary course of business. On the other hand, if shareholder rights are only protective in nature\n(referred to as protective rights), then such rights would not overcome the presumption that the owner of a majority voting interest shall\nconsolidate its investee. Significant judgment is required to determine whether minority rights represent substantive participating rights or\nprotective rights that do not affect the evaluation of control. While both represent an approval or veto right, a distinguishing factor is the\nunderlying activity or action to which the right relates.\nPension and Other Postretirement Plans — The Company recognizes a net asset or liability reflecting the funded status of pension\nand other postretirement plans with current-ye",

These assumptions are reviewed by the Company on an\nannual basis. Refer to Note 1—General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further\ninformation.\nRevenue Recognition — The Company recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of energy, capacity, and other services to customers\nin an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled. In applying the revenue model, we determine whether the sale of\nenergy, capacity, and other services represent a single performance obligation based on the individual market and terms of the contract.\nGenerally, the promise to transfer energy and capacity represent a performance obligation that is satisfied over time and meets the criteria to be\naccounted for as a series of distinct goods or services. Progress toward satisfaction of a performance obligation is measured using output\nmethods, such as MWhs delivered or MWs made available, and when we are entitled to consideration in an amount that corresponds directly to\nthe value of our performance completed to date, we recognize revenue in the amount to which we have the right to invoice. For further\ninformation regarding the nature of our revenue streams and our critical accounting policies affecting revenue recognition, see Note 1—General\nand Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nLeases — The Company recognizes operating and finance right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets\nfor most leases with an initial term of greater than 12 months. Lease liabilities and their corresponding right-of-use assets are recorded based on\nthe present value of lease payments over the expected lease term.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nOverview Regarding Market Risks\nOur businesses are exposed to and proactively manage market risk. Our primary market risk exposure is to the price of commodities,\nparticularly electricity, oil, natural gas, coal, and environmental credits. In addition, our businesses are exposed to lower electricity prices due to\nincreased competition, including from renewable sources such as wind and solar, as a result of lower costs of entry and lower variable costs. We\noperate in multiple countries and as such are subject to volatility in exchange rates at varying degrees at the subsidiary level and between our\nfunctional currency, the USD, and currencies of the countries in which we operate. We are also exposed to interest rate fluctuations due to our\nissuance of debt and related financial instruments.\nThe disclosures presented in this Item 7A are based upon a number of assumptions; actual effects may differ. The safe harbor provided in\nSection 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Exchange Act shall apply to the disclosures contained in this Item 7A. For\nfurther information regarding market risk, see Item 1A.—Risk Factors, Fluctuations in currency exchange rates may impact our financial results\nand position; Wholesale power prices may experience significant volatility in our markets which could impact our operations and opportunities for\nfuture growth; We may not be adequately hedged against our exposure to changes in commodity prices or interest rates; and Certain of our\nbusinesses are sensitive to variations in weather and hydrology of this 2022 Form 10-K.\nCommodity Price Risk\nAlthough we prefer to hedge our exposure to the impact of market fluctuations in the price of electricity, fuels, and environmental credits,\nsome of our generation businesses operate under short-term sales, have contracted electricity obligations greater than supply or operate under\ncontract sales that leave an unhedged exposure on some of our capacity or through imperfect fuel pass-throughs.

We employ risk management\nstrategies to hedge our financial performance against the effects of fluctuations in energy commodity prices. The implementation of these\nstrategies can involve the use of physical and financial commodity contracts, futures, swaps, and options.\nThe portion of our sales and purchases that are not subject to such agreements or contracted businesses where indexation is not perfectly\nmatched to business drivers will be exposed to commodity price risk. When hedging the output of our generation assets, we utilize contract sales\nthat lock in the spread per MWh between variable costs and the price at which the electricity can be sold.\nAES businesses will see changes in variable margin performance as global commodity prices shift. For 2023, we project pre-tax earnings\nexposure on a 10% (uncorrelated) move in commodity prices to be approximately a $5 million gain for power, a $10 million loss for oil, and a $5\nmillion loss for coal and natural gas. Our estimates exclude correlation of oil with coal or natural gas. For example, a decline in oil or natural gas\nprices can be accompanied by a decline in coal price if commodity prices are correlated. In aggregate, the Company's downside exposure\noccurs with lower power, lower oil, higher natural gas, and higher coal prices. Exposures at individual businesses will change as new contracts\nor financial hedges are executed, and our sensitivity to changes in commodity prices generally increases in later years with reduced hedge\nlevels at some of our businesses.\n\n\n122 | 2022 Annual Report\nCommodity prices affect our businesses differently depending on the local market characteristics and risk management strategies. Spot\npower prices, contract indexation provisions, and generation costs can be directly or indirectly affected by movements in the price of natural gas,\noil, and coal. We have some natural offsets across our businesses such that low commodity prices may benefit certain businesses and be a cost\nto others. Exposures are not perfectly linear or symmetric. The sensitivities are affected by a number of local or indirect market factors.\nExamples of these factors include hydrology, local energy market supply/demand balances, regional fuel supply issues, regional competition,\nbidding strategies, and regulatory interventions such as price caps. Operational flexibility changes the shape of our sensitivities. For instance,\ncertain power plants may limit downside exposure by reducing dispatch in low market environments. Volume variation also affects our\ncommodity exposure. The volume sold under contracts or retail concessions can vary based on weather and economic conditions, resulting in a\nhigher or lower volume of sales in spot markets. Thermal unit availability and hydrology can affect the generation output available for sale and\ncan affect the marginal unit setting power prices.\nIn the US and Utilit",

At Southland, our existing once-through cooling generation units (“Legacy Assets”) are permitted to\noperate through the end of 2023. These assets have contracts in capacity and have seen incremental value in energy revenues.\nIn the South America SBU, our business in Chile owns assets in the central and northern regions of the country and has a portfolio of\ncontract sales in both. The significant portion of our PPAs include mechanisms of indexation that adjust the price of energy based on fluctuations\nin the price of coal, with the specific indices and timing varying by contract, in order to mitigate changes in the price of fuel. For the portion of our\ncontracts not indexed to the price of coal, we have implemented a hedging strategy based on international coal financial instruments for up to 3\nyears. In Colombia, we operate under a shorter-term sales strategy with spot market exposure for uncontracted volumes. Because we own\nhydroelectric assets there, contracts are not indexed to fuel. Additionally, in Brazil, the hydroelectric generating facility is covered by contract\nsales. Under normal hydrological volatility, spot price risk is mitigated through a regulated sharing mechanism across all hydroelectric generators\nin the country. Under drier conditions, the sharing mechanism may not be sufficient to cover the business' contract position, and therefore it may\nhave to purchase power at spot prices driven by the cost of thermal generation.\nIn the MCAC SBU, our businesses have commodity exposure on unhedged volumes. Panama is highly contracted under financial and\nload-following PPA type structures, exposing the business to hydrology-based variance. To the extent hydrological inflows are greater than or\nless than the contract volumes, the business will be sensitive to changes in spot power prices which may be driven by oil and natural gas prices\nin some time periods. In the Dominican Republic, we own natural gas plants contracted under a portfolio of contract sales, and both contract and\nspot prices may move with commodity prices. Additionally, the contract levels do not always match our generation availability and our assets\nmay be sellers of spot prices in excess of contract levels or a net buyer in the spot market to satisfy contract obligations.\nIn the Eurasia SBU, our assets operating in Vietnam and Bulgaria have minimal exposure to commodity price risk as it has no or minor\nmerchant exposure and fuel is subject to a pass-through mechanism.\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\nIn the normal course of business, we are exposed to foreign currency risk and other foreign operations risks that arise from investments in\nforeign subsidiaries and affiliates.

Additionally, certain of our foreign subsidiaries and affiliates have entered\ninto monetary obligations in USD or currencies other than their own functional currencies.

Our\nexposure to certain of these currencies may be material.

The largest foreign exchange risks for 2023 stem from the following\ncurrencies: Brazilian real and Euro. As of December 31, 2022, assuming a 10% USD appreciation, cash distributions attributable to foreign\nsubsidiaries exposed to movement in the exchange rate of the Brazilian real are projected to be impacted by less than a $10 million gain, a less\nthan $5 million gain for the Colombian peso and a less than $5 million loss for the Euro. These numbers have been produced by applying a one-\ntime 10% USD appreciation to forecasted exposed cash distributions for 2023 coming from the respective subsidiaries exposed to the currencies\nlisted above, net of the impact of outstanding hedges and holding all other variables constant. The numbers presented above are net of any\ntransactional gains/losses. These sensitivities may change in the future as new hedges are executed or existing hedges are unwound.\nAdditionally, updates to the forecasted cash distributions exposed to foreign exchange risk may result in further modification. The sensitivities\npresented do not capture the impacts of any administrative market restrictions or currency inconvertibility.\nInterest Rate Risks\nWe are exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates as a result of our issuance of variable and fixed-rate debt, as well as interest\nrate swap, cap, floor, and option agreements.

In addition, auditing the Company’s valuation of long-lived assets\nused in the Maritza and TEG TEP impairment analyses involved significant judgment due to the significant unobservable\ninputs used in the estimation of the asset groups’ fair value.

GENERAL AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe AES Corporation is a holding company (the \"Parent Company\") that, through its subsidiaries and affiliates, (collectively, \"AES\" or \"the\nCompany\") operates a geographically diversified portfolio of electricity generation and distribution businesses. Generally, the liabilities of\nindividual operating entities are non-recourse to the Parent Company and are isolated to the operating entities. Most of our operating entities are\nstructured as limited liability entities, which limit the liability of shareholders. The structure is generally the same regardless of whether a\nsubsidiary is consolidated under a voting or variable interest model. The preparation of the",

          "chunk": "e preparation of these consolidated financial statements is in conformity\nwith accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\").\nPRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION — The consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of The AES\nCorporation and its controlled subsidiaries. Furthermore, VIEs in which the Company has an ownership interest and is the primary beneficiary,\nthus controlling the VIE, have been consolidated. Intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. Investments in\nentities where the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, are accounted for using the equity method of\naccounting.\nNONCONTROLLING INTERESTS — Noncontrolling interests are classified as a separate component of equity in the Consolidated\nBalance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity. Additionally, net income and comprehensive income attributable to\nnoncontrolling interests are reflected separately from consolidated net income and comprehensive income on the Consolidated Statements of\nOperations and Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity. Any change in ownership of a subsidiary while the controlling financial interest is\nretained is accounted for as an equity transaction between the controlling and noncontrolling interests. Losses continue to be attributed to the\nnoncontrolling interests, even when the noncontrolling interests' basis has been reduced to zero.\nEquity securities with redemption features that are not solely within the control of the issuer are classified as temporary equity and are\nincluded in Redeemable stock of subsidiaries on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Generally, initial measurement will be at fair value. The\nsubsequent allocation of income and dividends is classified in temporary equity. Subsequent measurement and classification vary depending on\nwhether the instrument is probable of becoming redeemable. For those securities that are currently redeemable or where it is probable that the\ninstrument will become redeemable, AES recognizes any changes from the carrying value to redemption value at each reporting period against\nretained earnings or additional paid-in capital in the absence of retained earnings; such adjustments are classified in temporary equity. When the\nequity instrument is not probable of becoming redeemable, no adjustment to the carrying value is recognized. Instruments that are mandatorily\nredeemable are classified as a liability.\nEQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS — Investments in entities over which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence, but\nnot control, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and reported in Investments in and advances to affiliates on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheets. The Company’s proportionate share of the net income or loss of these companies is included in Net equity in\nlosses of affiliates on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe Compan",

The Company discontinues the application of the equity method when an investment is reduced\nto zero and the Company is not otherwise committed to provide further financial support to the investee. The Company resumes the application\nof the equity method accounting to the extent that net income is greater than the share of net losses not previously recorded.\nUpon acquiring the investment, we determine the fair value of the identifiable assets and assumed liabilities and the basis difference\nbetween each fair value and the carrying amount of the corresponding asset or liability in the financial statements of the investee. The AES\nshare of the amortization of the basis difference is recognized in Net equity in losses of affiliates in the Consolidated Statements of Operations\nover the life of the asset or liability.\nThe Company periodically assesses if impairment indicators exist at our equity method investments. When an impairment is observed, any\nexcess of the carrying amount over its estimated fair value is recognized as impairment\n\n\n134 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020\nexpense when the loss in value is deemed other-than-temporary and included in Other non-operating expense in the Consolidated Statements\nof Operations.\nBUSINESS INTERESTS — Acquisitions and disposals of business interests are generally transactions pertaining to operational legal\nentities, which may be accounted for as a consolidated business, an asset, or an equity method investment. Losses on expected sales of\nbusiness interests are limited to the impairment of long-lived assets as of the date of execution of the sales agreement, which are recognized in\nAsset impairment expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Any gains/(losses) upon the completion of disposals, which include\nreclassification of cumulative translation adjustments, are recognized in Loss on disposal and sale of business interests in the Consolidated\nStatements of Operations upon completion of the sale.\nALLOCATION OF EARNINGS — Certain of the Company's businesses are subject to profit-sharing arrangements where the allocation of\ncash distributions and the sharing of tax benefits are not based on fixed ownership percentages. These arrangements exist for certain U.S.\nrenewable generation partnerships to designate different allocations of value among investors, where the allocations change in form or\npercentage over the life of the partnership. For these businesses, the Company uses the hypothetical liquidation at book value (“HLBV”) method\nwhen it is a reasonable approximation of the profit-sharing arrangement. The HLBV method calculates the proceeds that would be attributable to\neach partner based on the liquidation provisions of the respective operating partn",

The cost of renewals\nand improvements that extend the useful life of property, plant and equipment are capitalized.\nConstruction progress payments, engineering costs, insurance costs, salaries, interest and other costs directly relating to construction in\nprogress are capitalized during the construction period, provided the completion of the construction project is deemed probable, or expensed at\nthe time construction completion is determined to no longer be probable. The continued capitalization of such costs is subject to risks related to\nsuccessful completion, including those related to government approvals, site identification, financing, construction permitting and contract\ncompliance.

The Company accounts for purchased emission\nallowances as intangible assets and records an expense when they are utilized or sold. Granted emission allowances are valued at zero.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets — When circumstances indicate the carrying amount of long-lived assets in a held-for-use asset group\nmay not be recoverable, the Company evaluates the assets for potential impairment using internal projections of undiscounted cash flows\nresulting from the use and eventual disposal of the assets. Events or changes in circumstances that may necessitate a recoverability evaluation\ninclude, but are not limited to, adverse changes in the regulatory environment, unfavorable changes in power prices or fuel costs, increased\ncompetition due to additional capacity in the grid, technological advancements, declining trends in demand, or an expectation it is more likely\nthan not that the asset will be disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life. If the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the\nundiscounted cash flows, an impairment expense is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair\nvalue (subject to the carrying amount not being reduced below fair value for any individual long-lived asset that is determinable without undue\ncost and effort). An impairment expense for certain assets may be reduced by the establishment of a regulatory asset if recovery through\napproved rates is probable.\nDEBT ISSUANCE COSTS — Costs incurred in connection with the issuance of long-term debt are deferred and presented as a direct\nreduction from the face amount of that debt and amortized over the related financing period using the effective interest method.

When a new liability is recognized, the Company capitalizes the costs of the liability by increasing the\ncarrying amount of the related long-lived asset. The liability is accreted to its present value each period and the capitalized cost is depreciated\nover the useful life of the related asset.

Revenue under these contracts is recognized using an\noutput method measured by the MWh delivered each month, which best depicts the transfer of goods or services to the customer, at the\napproved tariff.\nThe Company has businesses where it sells and purchases power to and from ISOs and RTOs. Our utility businesses generally purchase\npower to satisfy the demand of customers that is not contracted through separate PPAs. In these instances, the Company accounts for these\ntransactions on a net hourly basis because the transactions are settled on a net hourly basis. In limited situations, a utility customer may choose\nto receive generation services from a third-party provider, in which case the Company may serve as a billing agent for the provider and\nrecognize revenue on a net basis.\nGeneration — Most of our generation fleet sells electricity under contracts to customers such as utilities, industrial users, and other\nintermediaries. Our generation contracts, based on specific facts and circumstances, can have one or more performance obligations as the\npromise to transfer energy, capacity, and other services may or may not be distinct depending on the nature of the market and terms of the\ncontract.\nFor contracts determined to have multiple performance obligations, we allocate revenue to each performance obligation based on its\nrelative standalone selling price using a market or expected cost plus margin approach.

In some contracts, such as requirement\ncontracts, the legally enforceable rights merely give the customer a right to purchase additional goods and services which are distinct.

These contracts may include a difference in timing between revenue\nrecognition and the collection of cash receipts, which may be collected over the term of the entire arrangement. The timing difference could\nresult in a significant financing component for the construction performance obligation if determined to be a material component of the\ntransaction price.

We bill both generation and utilities\ncustomers on a contractually agreed-upon schedule, typically at periodic intervals (e.g., monthly). The calculation of revenue earned but not yet\nbilled is based on the number of days not billed in the month, the estimated amount of energy delivered during those days and the estimated\naverage price per customer class for that month.\nOur contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue which is classified as current or noncurrent based on the timing of when we expect to\nrecognize revenue. The current portion of our contract liabilities is reported in Accrued and other liabilities and the noncurrent portion is reported\nin Other noncurrent liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nRemaining Performance Obligations — The transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations represents future\nconsideration for unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) performance obligations at the end of the reporting period.

Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized on commencement of the lease based on the\npresent value of lease payments over the lease term. Generally, the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable; as such, we use the\nsubsidiaries’ incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease\npayments. The Company determines discount rates based on its existing credit rates of its unsecured borrowings, which are then adjusted for\nthe appropriate lease term and currency. The right-of-use asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives that are\npaid or payable to the lessee at commencement. The lease term includes the option to extend or terminate the lease if it is reasonably certain\nthat the option will be exercised.\nThe Company has operating leases for certain generation contracts that contain provisions to provide capacity to a customer, which is a\nstand-ready obligation to deliver energy when required by the customer in which the Company is the lessor. Capacity payments are generally\nconsidered lease elements as they cover the majority of available output from a facility. The allocation of contract payments between the lease\nand non-lease elements is made at the inception of the lease.

As the payments for the construction performance obligation occur over\na 25-year term, a significant financing element was determined to exist which is accounted for under the effective interest rate method.\nHistorically, the Company has not incurred any losses on this arrangement, of which no directly comparable assets exist in the market. In order\nto determine expected credit losses under ASC 326 arising from this $1.4 billion loan receivable as of January 1, 2020, the Company considered\naverage historical default and recovery rates on similarly rated sovereign bonds, which formed an initial basis for developing a probability of\ndefault, net of expected recoveries, to be applied as a key credit quality indicator for this arrangement.

FAIR VALUE\nThe fair value of current financial assets and liabilities, debt service reserves, and other deposits approximate their reported carrying\namounts. The estimated fair values of the Company's assets and liabilities have been determined using available market information. Because\nthese amounts are estimates and based on hypothetical transactions to sell assets or transfer liabilities, the use of different market assumptions\nand/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.\nValuation Techniques — The fair value measurement accounting guidance describes three main approaches to measuring the fair value\nof assets and liabilities: (1) market approach, (2) income approach, and (3) cost approach.

The income approach uses valuation\ntechniques to convert future amounts to a single present value amount. The measurement is based on current market expectations of the return\non those future amounts. The cost approach is based on the amount that would currently be required to replace an asset. The Company\nmeasures its investments and derivatives at fair value on a recurring basis. Additionally, in connection with annual or event-driven impairment\nevaluations, certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These include long-lived tangible\nassets (i.e., property, plant and equipment), goodwill, and intangible assets (e.g., sales concessions, land use rights and water rights, etc.). In\ngeneral, the Company determines the fair value of investments and derivatives using the market approach and the income approach,\nrespectively. In the nonrecurring measurements of nonfinancial assets and liabilities, all three approaches are considered; however, the value\nestimated under the income approach is often the most representative of fair value.\nInvestments — The Company's investments measured at fair value generally consist of marketable debt and equity securities. Equity\nsecurities are either measured at fair value using quoted market prices or based on comparisons to market data obtained for similar assets. Debt\nsecurities primarily consist of unsecured debentures and certificates of deposit held by our Brazilian subsidiaries. Returns and pricing on these\ninstruments are generally indexed to the market interest rates in Brazil. Debt securities are measured at fair value based on comparisons to\nmarket data obtained for similar assets.\nDerivatives — Derivatives are measured at fair value using quoted market prices or the income approach utilizing volatilities, spot and\nforward benchmark interest rates (such as LIBOR, SOFR, and EURIBOR), foreign exchange rates, credit data, and commodity prices, as\napplicable. When significant inputs are not observable, the Company uses relevant techniques to determine the inputs, such as regression\nanalysis or prices for similarly traded instruments available in the market.\nThe Company's methodology to fair value its derivatives is to start with any observable inputs; however, in certain instances the published\nforward rates or prices may not extend through the remaining term of the contract, and management must make assumptions to extrapolate the\ncurve, which necessitates the use of unobservable inputs, such as proxy commodity prices or historical settlements to forecast forward prices.\nSpecifically, where there is limited forward curve data with respect to foreign exchange contracts beyond the traded points, the Company utilizes\nthe interest rate differential approach to construct the remaining portion of the forward curve. Similarly, in certain instances, the spread that\nreflects the",

The Company then\nmakes a credit valuation adjustment (\"CVA\"), as applicable, by further discounting the cash flows for nonperformance or credit risk based on the\nobservable or estimated debt spread of the Company's subsidiary or its counterparty and the tenor of the respective derivative instrument. The\nCVA for potential\n\n\n148 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020\nfuture scenarios in which the derivative is in an asset position is based on the counterparty's credit ratings, credit default swap spreads, and debt\nspreads, as available. The CVA for potential future scenarios in which the derivative is in a liability position is based on the Parent Company's or\nthe subsidiary's current debt spread. In the absence of readily obtainable credit information, the Parent Company's or the subsidiary's estimated\ncredit rating (based on applying a standard industry model to historical financial information and then considering other relevant information) and\nspreads of comparably rated entities or the respective country's debt spreads are used as a proxy. All derivative instruments are analyzed\nindividually and are subject to unique risk exposures.\nThe fair value hierarchy of an asset or a liability is based on the level of significance of the input assumptions. An input assumption is\nconsidered significant if it affects the fair value by at least 10%. Assets and liabilities are classified as Level 3 when the use of unobservable\ninputs is significant. When the use of unobservable inputs is insignificant, assets and liabilities are classified as Level 2. Transfers between Level\n3 and Level 2 result from changes in significance of unobservable inputs used to calculate the CVA.\nDebt — Recourse and non-recourse debt are carried at amortized cost. The fair value of recourse debt is estimated based on quoted\nmarket prices. The fair value of non-recourse debt is estimated based upon interest rates and other features of the loan. In general, the carrying\namount of variable rate debt is a close approximation of its fair value. For fixed rate loans, the fair value is estimated using quoted market prices\nor discounted cash flow (\"DCF\") analyses. The fair value of recourse and non-recourse debt excludes accrued interest at the valuation date. The\nfair value was determined using available market information as of December 31, 2022. The Company is not aware of any factors that would\nsignificantly affect the fair value amounts subsequent to December 31, 2022.\nNonrecurring measurements — For nonrecurring measurements derived using the income approach, fair value is generally determined\nusing valuation models based on the principles of DCF.

Where the use of market observable data is limited or not available\nfor certain input assumptions, the Company develops its own estimates using a variety of techniques such as regression analysis and\nextrapolations. Depending on the complexity of a valuation, an independent valuation firm may be engaged to assist management in the\nvaluation process.\nFor nonrecurring measurements derived using the market approach, recent market transactions involving the sale of identical or similar\nassets are considered. The use of this approach is limited because it is often difficult to identify sale transactions of identical or similar assets.\nThis approach is used in impairment evaluations of certain intangible assets. Otherwise, it is used to corroborate the fair value determined under\nthe income approach.\nFor nonrecurring measurements derived using the cost approach, fair value is typically based upon a replacement cost approach. This\napproach involves a considerable amount of judgment, which is why its use is limited to the measurement of long-lived tangible assets. Like the\nmarket approach, this approach is also used to corroborate the fair value determined under the income approach.\nFair Value Considerations — In determining fair value, the Company considers the source of observable market data inputs, liquidity of\nthe instrument, the credit risk of the counterparty, and the risk of the Company's or its counterparty's nonperformance. The conditions and criteria\nused to assess these factors are:\nSources of market assumptions — The Company derives most of its market assumptions from market efficient data sources\n(e.g., Bloomberg and Reuters). To determine fair value where market data is not readily available, management uses comparable market\nsources and empirical evidence to develop its own estimates of market assumptions.\nMarket liquidity — The Company evaluates market liquidity based on whether the financial or physical instrument, or the underlying asset,\nis traded in an active or inactive market. An active market exists if the prices are fully transparent to market participants, can be measured by\nmarket bid and ask quotes, the market has a relatively large proportion of trading volume as compared to the Company's current trading volume,\nand the market has a significant number of market participants that will allow the market to rapidly absorb the quantity of assets traded without\nsignificantly affecting the market price. Another factor the Company considers when determining whether a market is active or inactive is the\npresence of government or regulatory controls over pricing that could make it difficult to establish a market-based price when entering into a\ntransaction.\nNonperformance risk — Nonperformance risk refers to the risk that an obligation will not be fulfilled and affects the value at which a l",

The Tariff Stabilization Laws do not allow the pass-through of these contractual indexation updates to customers beyond the\npricing in effect at July 1, 2019, until new lower-cost renewable contracts are incorporated to supply regulated contracts. Consequently, costs\nincurred in excess of the July 1, 2019 price are accumulated and borne by generators. Through different programs, AES Andes aims to reduce\nits exposure and has already sold a significant portion of the receivables accumulated as of December 31, 2021.\nAs of December 31, 2022, $26 million of current receivables and $227 million of noncurrent receivables were recorded in Accounts\nreceivable and Other noncurrent assets, respectively, pertaining to the Stabilization Funds.

The Company monitors these risks, including the credit\nratings of the Argentine government, on a quarterly basis to assess the collectability of these receivables. The Company accrues interest on\nthese receivables once the recognition criteria have been met. The Company's collection estimates are based on assumptions that it believes to\nbe reasonable, but are inherently uncertain. Actual future cash flows could differ from these estimates.\nAs a result of energy market reforms in 2004 and 2010, AES Argentina entered into three agreements with the Argentine government,\nreferred to as the FONINVEMEM Agreements, to contribute a portion of their accounts receivable into a fund for financing the construction of\ncombined cycle and gas-fired plants. These receivables accrue interest and are collected in monthly installments over 10 years once the related\nplant begins operations.\nThe FONINVEMEM receivables are denominated in Argentine pesos, but indexed to USD, which represents a foreign currency derivative.\nDue to differences between spot rates, used to remeasure the receivables, and discounted forward rates, used to value the foreign currency\nderivative, these two items will not perfectly offset over the life of the receivable. Once settled, the foreign currency derivative will offset the\naccumulated unrealized foreign currency losses resulting from the devaluation of the FONINVEMEM receivable. As of December 31, 2022 and\n2021, the amount of the foreign currency-related derivative assets associated with the FONINVEMEM financing receivables that were excluded\nfrom the table above had a fair value of $64 million and $108 million, respectively.\nThe receivables under the FONINVEMEM Agreements have been actively collected since the related plants commenced operations in\n2010 and 2016. In assessing the collectability of the receivables under these agreements, the Company also considers historic collection\nevidence in accordance with the agreements.\n8.

Impairment indicators were identified primarily as a result of inability to re-contract\nGuacolda’s generation after expiration of its existing PPAs driven by lower energy prices in Chile and reduced forecasted cash flows resulting\nfrom decarbonization initiatives of the Chilean Government. Guacolda recognized a long-lived asset impairment at the investee level, which\nnegatively impacted the Company's Net equity in losses of affiliates by $127 million. As a result, the Company’s basis in its investment in\nGuacolda was reduced to zero and the equity method of accounting was suspended.\nIn February 2021, AES Andes entered into an agreement to sell its 50% ownership interest in Guacolda for $34 million. On July 20, 2021,\nthe Company completed the sale, resulting in a pre-tax gain on sale of $34 million, recorded in Loss on disposal and sale of business interests.\nPrior to its sale, the Guacolda equity method investment was reported in the South America SBU reportable segment.\nBarry — The Company holds a 100% ownership interest in AES Barry Ltd.

Two plans cover U.S. non-union\nemployees; one for Parent Company and certain US and Utilities SBU business employees, and one for AES Ohio employees. The remaining\ntwo plans include union and non-union employees at AES Indiana and union employees at AES Ohio. The DC Plans are qualified under\nsection 401 of the Internal Revenue Code. Most U.S. employees of the Company are eligible to participate in the appropriate plan except for\nthose employees who are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, unless such agreement specifically provides that the employee is\nconsidered an eligible employee under a plan. Within the DC Plans, the Company provides matching contributions in addition to other non-\nmatching contributions. Participants are fully vested in their own contributions. The Company's contribu",

These assumptions include\nestimates of the present value of projected future pension payments to all plan participants, taking into consideration the likelihood of potential\nfuture events such as salary increases and demographic experience. These assumptions may have an effect on the amount and timing of future\ncontributions.\nThe assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors: discount rates, salary growth, retirement\nrates, inflation, expected return on plan assets, and mortality rates. The effects of actual results differing from the Company's assumptions are\naccumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect the Company's recognized expense in such future periods.\nUnrecognized gains or losses are amortized using the “corridor approach,” under which the net gain or loss in excess of 10% of the greater of\nthe projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of the assets, if applicable, is amortized.\nSensitivity of the Company's pension funded status to the indicated increase or decrease in the discount rate and long-term rate of return\non plan assets assumptions is shown below. Note that these sensitivities may be asymmetric and are specific to the base conditions at year-end\n2022. They also may not be additive, so the impact of changing multiple factors simultaneously cannot be calculated by combining the individual\nsensitivities shown. The funded status as of December 31, 2022 is affected by the assumptions as of that date. Pension expense for 2022 is\naffected by the December 31, 2021 assumptions.

The 2024 Purchase Contract holders may\nelect to settle their obligation early, in cash. The Series A Preferred Stock is pledged as collateral to guarantee the holders’ obligations to\npurchase common stock under the terms of the 2024 Purchase Contracts. The initial settlement rate determining the number of shares that each\nholder must purchase will not exceed the maximum settlement rate and is determined over a market value averaging period preceding February\n15, 2024.\nThe initial maximum settlement rate of 3.864 was calculated using an initial reference price of $25.88, equal to the last reported sale price\nof the Company’s common stock on March 4, 2021. As of December 31, 2022, due to the customary anti-dilution provisions, the maximum\nsettlement rate was 3.8691, equivalent to a reference price of $25.85. If the applicable market value of the Company’s common stock is less\nthan or equal to the reference price, the settlement rate will be the maximum settlement rate; and if the applicable market value of common stock\nis greater than the reference price, the settlement rate will be a number of shares of the Company’s common stock equal to $100 divided by the\napplicable market value.

The $205 million present value of the\nContract Adjustment Payments at inception reduced the Series A Preferred Stock. As each quarterly Contract Adjustment Payment is made, the\nrelated liability is reduced and the difference between the cash payment and the present value will accrete to interest expense, approximately $5\nmillion over the three-year term. As of December 31, 2022, the present value of the Contract Adjustment Payments was $89 million.\nThe holders can settle the purchase contracts early, for cash, subject to certain exceptions and conditions in the prospectus supplement.\nUpon early settlement of any purchase contracts, the Company will deliver the number of shares of its common stock equal to 85% of the\nnumber of shares of common stock that would have otherwise been deliverable.\nEquity Transactions with Noncontrolling Interests\nAES Clean Energy Tax Equity Partnerships — The majority of solar projects under AES Clean Energy have been financed with tax equity\nstructures, in which tax equity investors receive a portion of the economic attributes of the facilities, including tax attributes",

EARNINGS PER SHARE\nBasic and diluted earnings per share are based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock and potential common stock\noutstanding during the period. Potential common stock, for purposes of determining diluted earnings per share, includes the effects of dilutive\nRSUs, stock options, and equity units. The effect of such potential common stock is computed using the treasury stock method for RSUs and\nstock options, and is computed using the if-converted method for equity units.\nThe following table is a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the basic and diluted earnings per share computation for income\nfrom continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, where income represents the numerator and weighted-\naverage shares represent the denominator.\n\n\n194 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020\nYear Ended December 31,\n2022\n2021\n2020\n(in millions, except per share data)\nLoss\nShares\n$ per Share\nLoss\nShares\n$ per Share\nIncome\nShares\n$ per Share\nBASIC EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE\nIncome (loss) from continuing operations attributable to\nThe AES Corporation common stockholders\n$\n(546)\n668 \n$\n(0.82)\n$\n(413)\n666 \n$\n(0.62)\n$\n43 \n665 \n$\n0.06 \nEFFECT OF DILUTIVE SECURITIES\nStock options\n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n1 \n— \nRestricted stock units\n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n2 \n— \nEquity units\n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \nDILUTED EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE\n$\n(546)\n668 \n$\n(0.82)\n$\n(413)\n666 \n$\n(0.62)\n$\n43 \n668 \n$\n0.06 \nFor the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the calculation of diluted earnings per share excluded 5 million\noutstanding stock awards and 40 million shares underlying our March 2021 Equity Units because their impact would be anti-dilutive given the\nloss from continuing operations. These shares could potentially dilute basic earnings per share in the future. Had the Company generated\nincome, potential shares of common stock of 3 million and 4 million related to the stock awards and 40 million and 33 million related to the Equity\nUnits, would have been included in diluted weighted-average shares outstanding for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31,\n2021, respectively.\nAs described in Note 17—Equity, the Company issued 10,430,500 Equity Units in March 2021 with a total notional value of $1,043 million.\nEach Equity Unit has a stated amount of $100 and was initially issued as a Corporate Unit, consisting of a 2024 Purchase Contract and a 10%\nundivided beneficial ownership interest in one share of Series A Preferred Stock.

RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES\nAES is a diversified power generation and utility company organized into four market-oriented SBUs. See additional discussion of the\nCompany's principal markets in Note 18—Segments and Geographic Information. Within our four SBUs, we have two primary lines of business:\ngeneration and utilities. The generation line of business uses a wide range of fuels and technologies to generate electricity such as coal, gas,\nhydro, wind, solar, and biomass. Our utilities business comprises businesses that transmit, distribute, and in certain circumstances, generate\npower. In addition, the Company has operations in the renewables area. These efforts include projects primarily in wind, solar, and energy\nstorage.\nOperating and Economic Risks — The Company operates in several developing economies where macroeconomic conditions are\ntypically more volatile than developed economies. Deteriorating market conditions and evolving industry expectations to transition away from\nfossil fuel sources for generation expose the Company to the risk of decreased earnings and cash flows due to, among other factors, adverse\nfluctuations in the commodities and foreign currency spot markets, and potential changes in the estimated useful lives of our thermal plants.\nAdditionally, credit markets around the globe continue to tighten their standards, which could impact our ability to finance growth projects through\naccess to capital markets. Currently, the Company has an investment grade rating from both Standard & Poor's and Fitch of BBB- and an\ninvestment grade rating from Moody's of Baa3. A downgrade in our current investment grade ratings could affect the Company's ability to finance\nnew and/or existing development projects at competitive interest rates. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had $1.4 billion of unrestricted\ncash and cash equivalents.\n\n\n195 | Notes",

We continue to invest in several developing countries to expand our existing platform and operations.

In addition, our Latin American operations experience volatility in revenue and earnings which have caused and are expected\nto cause significant volatility in our results of operations and cash flows. The volatility is caused by regulatory and economic difficulties, political\ninstability, indexation of certain PPAs to fuel prices, and currency fluctuations being experienced in many of these countries.

Under some of these scenarios, Alto Maipo may experience reduced future cash flows, which would limit its ability to repay debt. Alto\nMaipo’s management initiated negotiations with its creditors to restructure its obligations and achieve a sustainable long-term capital structure\nfor Alto Maipo. On November 17, 2021, Alto Maipo SpA commenced a reorganization proceeding in accordance with Chapter 11 of the U.S.\nBankruptcy Code, through a voluntary petition. Consequently, after the Chapter 11 filing, the Company is no longer considered to have control\nover Alto Maipo, which resulted in its deconsolidation.

If Alto Maipo is unable to meet its obligations under the restructured arrangements as they come due, the creditors\nmay enforce their rights under the credit agreements. These finance agreements are non-recourse with respect to The AES Corporation.\nForeign Currency Risks — AES operates businesses in many foreign countries and such operations could be impacted by significant\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Fluctuations in currency exchange rate between the USD and the following currencies could\ncreate significant fluctuations in earnings and cash flows: the Argentine peso, the Brazilian real, the Chilean peso, the Colombian peso, the\nDominican peso, the Euro, the Indian rupee, and the Mexican peso.\nConcentrations — Due to the geographical diversity of its operations, the Company does not have any significant concentration of\ncustomers or sources of fuel supply. Several of the Company's generation businesses rely on PPAs with one or a limited number of customers\nfor the majority of, and in some cases all of, the relevant businesses' output over the term of the PPAs. However, no single customer accounted\nfor 10% or more of total revenue in 2022, 2021 or 2020.\nThe cash flows and results of operations of our businesses depend on the credit quality of our customers and the continued ability of our\ncustomers and suppliers to meet their obligations under PPAs and fuel supply agreements.

In the ordinary course of business, these businesses enter into energy purchase and sale transactions, and transmission\nagreements with other state-owned institutions which are controlled by such governments. At two of our generation businesses in Mexico, the\nofftakers exercise significant influence, but not control, through representation on these businesses' Boards of Directors. These offtakers are\nalso required to hold a nominal ownership interest in such businesses. Furthermore, in 2021, the Company began construction projects with\nFluence relating to energy storage.

The Company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable\nassurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with\nGAAP and includes those policies and procedures that:\n•\npertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the\nassets of the Company;\n•\nprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance\nwith GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management\nand directors of the Company; and\n•\nprovide reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect\non the financial statements are prevented or detected timely.\nManagement, including our CEO and CFO, does not expect that our internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control\nsystem, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control\nsystem are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must\nbe considered relative to their costs. In addition, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls is subject to risks that those internal controls may\nbecome inadequate in future periods because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or\nprocedures deteriorates.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this\nassessment, management used the criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission (\"COSO\") in 2013. Based on this assessment, management believes that the Company maintained\neffective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022.\nThe effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, has been audited by Ernst &\nYoung LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which appears herein.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting:\nThere were no changes that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely\nto materially affect, our internal ",

There is a substantial need for more renewable energy as well as an opportunity for innovation\nto develop new products and solutions that help customers accomplish their individual decarbonization goals.\nThe focus of our strategy continues to be on partnering with large companies that are looking to transition to carbon-free sources of\nelectricity. As an indication of our success, in 2022 we were recognized by BNEF as the #1 global clean energy developer for corporations.\nIn 2022, we signed long-term contracts for 5.2 GW of renewable power, bringing our backlog of projects — those with signed contracts, but\nwhich are not yet in operation — to 12.2 GW. Our backlog serves as the core component of future growth.\nCentral to our renewables growth strategy is a focus on customer collaboration and co-creation, which helps us develop unique solutions\ntailored to a specific customer's needs. This approach not only contributes to customer satisfaction and repeat business, but it also allows AES\nto work with key customers on a bilateral basis rather than just through participation in bid processes.\nThis approach has led to the co-creation of several first-of-its-kind industry innovations, including agreements to supply 24/7 carbon-free\nenergy for global data center companies. Our unique capabilities in developing tailored energy solutions, enabled us to partner with Air Products\nto announce our plans to develop, build, own, and operate the largest green hydrogen production facility to date in the United States.\nWe are also working with some of the world's largest mining companies in their transition to renewable energy in South America, essentially\nreducing the emissions of major supply chains. One way in which we are serving the\n\n\n6 | 2022 Annual Report\nmining industry is through our Green Blend offering, in which we work to integrate renewable energy with thermal power during select hours of\nthe day, reducing overall thermal generation and lowering emissions.\nWith our utilities, we are working with a broad range of stakeholders to transition to lower carbon forms of energy while promoting a Just\nTransition for the workers and communities who may be negatively impacted by the closure of fossil fuel facilities. At AES Indiana, for example,\nwe are working to retire its remaining coal generation by the end of 2025, while adding new renewables and natural gas to the grid.\nOur renewable growth strategy includes taking steps to ensure and enable growth in future years. We massively expanded our pipeline of\ndevelopment projects, which grew from 55 GW in January 2022 to 64 GW as of the end of 2022, both through acquisitions and increased\ninvestment in development activities, such as securing land or advancing permitting and interconnection processes.

The financial performance of our renewables business is also impacted by our ability to complete construction projects and earn\nU.S. renewable tax credits.\nContract Sales — Most of our generation businesses sell electricity under medium- or long-term contracts (\"contract sales\") or under short-\nterm agreements in competitive markets (\"short-term sales\"). Our medium-term contract sales have terms of two to five years, while our long-\nterm contracts have terms of more than five years.\n",

When the contract does not include a\nfuel pass-through, we typically hedge fuel costs or enter into fuel or energy supply agreements for a similar contract period (see discussion\nbelow under Fuel Costs). These\n\n\n7 | 2022 Annual Report\ncontracts also help us to fund a significant portion of the total capital cost of the project through long-term non-recourse project-level financing.\nCertain contracts include capacity payments that cover projected fixed costs of the plant, including fixed O&M expenses, debt service, and\na return on capital invested. In addition, most of our contracts require that the majority of the capacity payments be denominated in the currency\nmatching our fixed costs.\nContracts that do not have significant fuel cost or do not contain a capacity payment are structured based on long-term spot prices with\nsome negotiated pass-through costs, allowing us to recover expected fixed and variable costs as well as provide a return on investment.\nThese contracts are intended to reduce exposure to the volatility of fuel and electricity prices by linking the business's revenues and costs.\nWe generally structure our business to eliminate or reduce foreign exchange risk by matching the currency of revenue and expenses, including\nfixed costs and debt. Our project debt may consist of both fixed and floating rate debt for which we typically hedge a significant portion of our\nexposure. Some of our contracted businesses also receive a regulated market-based capacity payment, which is discussed in more detail in the\nShort-Term Sales section below.\nThus, these contracts, or other related commercial arrangements, significantly mitigate our exposure to changes in power and, as\napplicable, fuel prices, currency fluctuations and changes in interest rates. In addition, these contracts generally provide for a recovery of our\nfixed operating expenses and a return on our investment, as long as we operate the plant to the reliability and efficiency standards required in\nthe contract.\nShort-Term Sales — Our other generation businesses sell power and ancillary services under short-term contracts with average terms of\nless than two years, including spot sales, directly in the short-term market or at regulated prices. The short-term markets are typically\nadministered by a system operator to coordinate dispatch. Short-term markets generally operate on merit order dispatch, where the least\nexpensive generation facilities, based upon variable cost or bid price, are dispatched first and the most expensive facilities are dispatched last.\nThe short-term price is typically set at the marginal cost of energy or bid price (the cost of the last plant required to meet system demand).

In\naddition, many of these wholesale markets include markets for ancillary services to support the reliable operation of the transmission system.\nAcross our portfolio, we provide a wide array of ancillary services, including voltage support, frequency regulation and spinning reserves.\nMany of the short-term markets in which we operate include regulated capacity markets. These capacity markets are intended to provide\nadditional revenue based upon availability without reliance on the energy margin from the merit order dispatch. Capacity markets are typically\npriced based on the cost of a new entrant and the system capacity relative to the desired level of reserve margin (generation available in excess\nof peak demand). Our generating facilities selling in the short-term markets typically receive capacity payments based on their availability in the\nmarket.\nPlant Reliability and Flexibility — Our contract and short-term sales provide incentives to our generation plants to optimally manage\navailability, operating efficiency and flexibility. Capacity payments under contract sales are frequently tied to meeting minimum standards. In\nshort-term sales, our plants must be reliable and flexible to capture peak market prices and to maximize market-based revenues. In addition, our\nflexibility allows us to capture ancillary service revenue while meeting local market needs.\nFuel Costs — For our thermal generation plants, fuel is a significant component of our total cost of generation. For contract sales, we often\nenter into fuel supply agreements to match the contract period, or we may financially hedge our fuel costs. Some of our contracts include\nindexation for fuels. In those cases, we seek to match our fuel supply agreements to the indexation. For certain projects, we have tolling\narrangements where the power offtaker is responsible for the supply and cost of fuel to our plants.\nIn short-term sales, we sell power at market prices that are generally reflective of the market cost of fuel at the time, and thus procure fuel\nsupply on a short-term basis, generally designed to match up with our market sales profile. Since fuel price is often the primary determinant for\npower prices, the economics of projects with short-term sales are often subject to volatility of relative fuel prices.

Additionally, weather variations, including temperature, solar and wind\nresources, and hydrological conditions, may also have an impact on generation output at our renewable generation facilities. In competitive\nmarkets for power, local economic activity can also have an impact on power demand and short-term prices for power.\nFixed-Cost Management — In our businesses with long-term contracts, the majority of the fixed O&M costs are recovered through the\ncapacity payment. However, for all generation businesses, managing fixed costs and reducing them over time is a driver of business\nperformance.\nCompetition — For our businesses with medium- or long-term contracts, there is limited competition during the term of the contract. For\nshort-term sales, plant dispatch and the price of electricity are determined by market competition and local dispatch and reliability rules.\nUtilities\nOur utility businesses consist of AES Indiana and AES Ohio in the U.S. and four utilities in El Salvador.

This regulation sets the framework for the prices (\"tariffs\") that our utilities are allowed to charge customers for\nelectricity and establishes service standards that we are required to meet.\nOur utilities are generally permitted to earn a regulated rate of return on assets, determined by the regulator based on the utility's allowed\nregulatory asset base, capital structure and cost of capital. The asset base on which the utility is permitted a return is determined by the\nregulator, within the framework of applicable local laws, and is based on the amount of assets that are considered used and useful in serving\ncustomers. Both the allowed return and the asset base are important components of the utility's earning power. The allowed rate of return and\noperating expenses deemed reasonable by the regulator are recovered through the regulated tariff that the utility charges to its customers.\nThe tariff may be reviewed and reset by the regulator from time to time depending on local regulations, or the utility may seek a change in\nits tariffs. The tariff is generally based upon usage level and may include a pass-through of costs that are not controlled by the utility, such as the\ncosts of fuel (in the case of integrated utilities) and/or the costs of purchased energy, to the customer. Components of the tariff that are directly\npassed through to the\n\n\n9 | 2022 Annual Report\ncustomer are usually adjusted through a summary regulatory process or an existing formula-based mechanism. In some regulatory regimes,\ncustomers with demand above an established level are unregulated and can choose to contract directly with the utility or with other retail energy\nsuppliers and pay non-bypassable fees, which are fees to the distribution company for use of its distribution system.\nThe regulated tariff generally recognizes that our utility businesses should recover certain operating and fixed costs, as well as manage\nuncollectible amounts, quality of service and technical and non-technical losses. Utilities, therefore, need to manage costs to the levels reflected\nin the tariff, or risk non-recovery of costs or diminished returns.\nSeasonality, Weather Variations, and Economic Activity — Our utility businesses are generally affected by seasonal weather patterns and,\ntherefore, operating margin is not generated evenly throughout the year. Additionally, weather variations may also have an impact based on the\nnumber of customers, temperature variances from normal conditions, and customers' historic usage levels and patterns.

Tax credits associated with the development of U.S. renewables projects can be substantial and have increased with the adoption of\nthe IRA. In 2022, AES recognized $246 million of pre-tax contribution related to the allocation of tax credits to tax equity partners of U.S.\nrenewables projects. The financial results of U.S. renewable assets are primarily driven by the amount of wind or solar resource at the facilities,\navailability of facilities, growth in projects, and by tax credit recognition once placed in service.\nA majority of solar projects under AES Clean Energy have been financed with tax equity structures. Under these tax equity structures, the\ntax equity investors receive a portion of the economic attributes of the facilities, including tax attributes, that vary over the life of the projects.\nBased on certain liquidation provisions of the tax equity structures, this could result in variability to earnings attributable to AES compared to the\nearnings reported at the facilities. In 2022, AES Clean Energy largely generated investment tax credits (\"ITCs\") from its renewable assets. We\nexpect that the extension of the current ITCs and production tax credits (\"PTCs\"), as well as higher credits available for projects that satisfy wage\nand apprenticeship requirements under the IRA, will increase demand for our renewable products.\nLaurel Mountain, Buffalo Gap I, Buffalo Gap II, and Buffalo Gap III are exposed to the volatility of energy prices and their revenue may\nchange materially as energy prices fluctuate in their respective markets of operations. Laurel Mountain also operates 16 MW of battery energy\nstorage that is sold into the PJM market as regulation energy. For these projects, PJM and ERCOT power prices impact financial results.\nDevelopment Strategy — As states, communities, and organizations of all types make commitments and plan to reduce their carbon\nfootprints, renewables are the fastest-growing source of electricity generation in the U.S. AES Clean Energy works with its customers to co-\ncreate and deliver the smarter, greener energy solutions that meet\n\n\n20 | 2022 Annual Report\ntheir needs, including 24/7 carbon-free energy.

These changes\nin tax policy are supportive of our strategy to grow the AES Clean Energy business through development of our 51 GW U.S. pipeline.\nTo support this growth and address challenges related to a primarily foreign supply chain for solar panels, AES has spearheaded the\ncreation of a U.S. Solar Buyer Consortium, in cooperation with other leading solar companies, with the intent to support the development of U.S.\ndomestic solar manufacturing.\nAES Clean Energy is actively developing new products and renewable sites to serve the current and future needs of its customers. To\nfurther this aim, AES Clean Energy matured its pipeline and expanded it to a total of 51 GW during 2022.\nU.S. Conventional Generation\nBusiness Description — In the U.S., we own a conventional generation portfolio. The principal markets and locations where we are\nengaged in the generation and supply of electricity (energy and capacity) are the California Independent System Operator (\"CAISO\"), PJM, and\nPuerto Rico. AES Southland, operating in the CAISO, is our most significant generation business. AES Hawaii previously operated a coal plant\nunder a PPA. The PPA expired and the plant was retired in the third quarter of 2022.\nMany of our non-renewable U.S. generation plants provide baseload operations and are required to maintain a guaranteed level of\navailability. Any change in availability has a direct impact on financial performance. Some plants are eligible for availability bonuses if they meet\ncertain requirements. Coal and natural gas are used as the primary fuels. Coal prices are set by market factors internationally, while natural gas\nprices are generally set domestically. Recently we have seen international impacts on domestic gas prices (Henry Hub) due to the large amount\nof U.S. natural gas that can be exported through the liquefaction plants that have come online in recent years. Price variations for these fuels\ncan change the composition of generation costs and energy prices in our generation businesses.\nThe generation businesses with PPAs have mechanisms to recover fuel costs from the offtaker, including an energy payment partially\nbased on the market price of fuel. When market price fluctuations in fuel are borne by the offtaker, revenue may change as fuel prices fluctuate,\nbut the variable margin or profitability should remain consistent. These businesses often have an opportunity to increase or decrease profitability\nfrom payments under their PPAs depending on such items as plant efficiency and availability, heat rate, and fuel flexibility.\nWarrior Run currently operates as a QF, as defined under the PURPA. This business entered into a long-term contract with an electric utility\nthat had a mandatory obligation to purchase power from QFs at the utility's avoided cost (i.e. the likely costs for both energy and capital\ninvestment that would have been incurred by the purchasing utility if that utility had to provide its own generating capacity or pur",

To be a QF, a cogeneration facility must produce electricity and useful thermal energy for an industrial or commercial process or\nheating or cooling application in certain proportions to the facility's total energy output and meet certain efficiency standards. To be a QF, a small\npower production facility must generally use a renewable resource as its energy input and meet certain size criteria or be a cogeneration facility\nthat simultaneously generates electricity and process heat or steam.\nOur non-QF generation businesses in the U.S. currently operate as Exempt Wholesale Generators as defined under the Energy Policy Act\nof 1992, amending the Public Utility Holding Company Act (“PUHCA”). These businesses, subject to approval of FERC, have the right to sell\npower at market-based rates, either directly to the wholesale market or to a third-party offtaker such as a power marketer or utility/industrial\ncustomer. Under the Energy Policy Act and FERC's regulations, approval from FERC to sell wholesale power at market-based rates is generally\ndependent upon a showing to FERC that the seller lacks market power in generation and transmission, that the seller and its affiliates cannot\nerect other barriers to market entry, and that there is no opportunity for abusive transactions involving regulated affiliates of the seller.\nThe U.S. wholesale electricity market consists of multiple distinct regional markets that are subject to both federal regulation, as\nimplemented by FERC, and regional regulation as defined by rules designed and\n\n\n21 | 2022 Annual Report\nimplemented by the RTOs, non-profit corporations that operate the regional transmission grid and maintain organized markets for electricity.\nThese rules, for the most part, govern such items as the determination of the market mechanism for setting the system marginal price for energy\nand the establishment of guidelines and incentives for the addition of new capacity.

This strategy de-links company's PPAs from legacy fossil resources, grows its renewable energy portfolio, and delivers a competitive,\nreliable energy solution. In line with the Green Blend strategy, AES Andes has committed to not build additional coal-based power plants and to\nadvance the development of new renewable projects, including the implementation of battery energy storage systems (\"BESS\") and other\ntechnological innovations that will provide greater flexibility and reliability to the system.\nAES Andes currently has long-term contracts, with an average remaining term of approximately 10 years, with regulated distribution\ncompanies and unregulated customers, such as mining and industrial companies. In general, these long-term contracts include pass-through\nmechanisms for fuel costs along with price indexations to U.S. Consumer Price Index (\"CPI\").\nIn addition to energy payments, AES Andes also receives capacity payments to compensate for availability during periods of peak demand.\nThe grid operator, Coordinador Electrico Nacional (\"CEN\"), annually determines the\n\n\n29 | 2022 Annual Report\ncapacity requirements for each power plant.

In the south-central region of the SEN, thermoelectric generation is required to fulfill\ndemand not satisfied by hydroelectric, solar, and wind output and is critical to provide reliable and dependable electricity supply under dry\nhydrological conditions in the highest demand area of the SEN. In the northern region of the SEN, which includes the Atacama Desert,\nthermoelectric capacity represents the majority of installed capacity. The fuels used for thermoelectric generation, mainly coal, diesel, and LNG,\nare indexed to international prices. In 2022, the installed generation capacity in the Chilean market was composed of 42% thermoelectric, 23%\nhydroelectric, 20% solar, 13% wind, and 2% other fuel sources.\nHydroelectric plants represent a significant portion of the system's installed capacity. Precipitation and snow melt impact hydrological\nconditions in Chile. Rain occurs principally from June to August and snow melt occurs from September to December. These factors affect\ndispatch of the system's hydroelectric and thermoelectric generation plants, thereby influencing spot market prices.\nThe Ministry of Energy has primary responsibility for the Chilean electricity system directly or through the National Energy Commission and\nthe Superintendency of Electricity and Fuels.\nAll generators can sell energy through contracts with regulated distribution companies or directly to unregulated customers. Unregulated\ncustomers are customers whose connected capacity is higher than 5 MW. Customers with connected capacity between 0.5 MW and 5 MW can\nopt for regulated or unregulated contracts for a minimum period of four years. By law, both regulated and unregulated customers are required to\npurchase all electricity under contracts. Generators may also sell energy to other power generation companies on a short-term basis at\nnegotiated prices outside the spot market. Electricity prices in Chile are denominated in USD, although payments are made in Chilean pesos.\nThe Chilean government’s decarbonization plan includes the complete retirement of the SEN coal fleet by the end of 2040 and carbon\nneutrality by 2050. On December 26, 2020, the Ministry of Energy’s Supreme Decree Number 42 went into effect, allowing coal plants to enter\ninto Strategic Reserve Status (“SRS”) and receive 60% of capacity payments for the 5-year period following its shutdown to remain connected as\na backup in case of a system emergency.

These four units together\nhave an installed capacity of 1,095 MW and each unit has publicly announced phase-out plans in line with the Company’s decarbonization\nstrategy. In July 2021, the Company also sold its entire ownership interest in Guacolda, a 764 MW coal-fired plant located in Chile. Guacolda,\nVentanas, and Angamos represent an aggregate of 2.2 GW of coal-fired capacity, or 72% of AES Andes’ legacy coal fleet. AES Andes continues\nto work under the Green Blend strategy to accelerate the phase-out of the remaining two coal-fired plants.\nEnvironmental Regulation — Chilean law requires all electricity generators to supply a certain portion of their total contractual obligations\nwith non-conventional renewable energy (\"NCRE\"). Generation companies are able to meet this requirement by building NCRE generation\ncapacity (wind, solar, biomass, geothermal, and small hydroelectric technology) or purchasing NCREs from qualified generators. Non-\ncompliance with the NCRE requirements will result in fines. AES Andes currently fulfills the NCRE requirements by utilizing AES Andes' solar,\nwind, and biomass power plants.\nSince 2017, emissions of particulate matter, SO , NO , and CO  are monitored for plants with an installed capacity over 50 MW; these\nemissions are taxed. In the case of CO , the tax is equivalent to $5 per ton emitted. Certain PPAs have clauses allowing the Company to pass\nthe green tax costs to unregulated customers, while some distribution PPAs do not allow for the pass through of these costs. During 2021, the\nChilean General Water Direction, as part of the Ministry of Public Works, established the obligation to install and maintain effective monitoring\nsystems for water withdrawal. We are currently implementing these systems in the power plants for which they are required.\nDuring 2022, new regulations associated with monitoring requirements were published, including Law 21,455, which is the framework on\nclimate change; the new Ventanas power plant Operational Plan; emission standards for back up generators; and recently enacted Law 21,505,\nwhich promotes electric energy storage and electromobility.

As of\nDecember 31, 2022, the installed capacity of the SADI totaled 42,927 MW. The SADI's installed capacity is composed primarily of thermoelectric\ngeneration (59%) and hydroelectric generation (26%), as well as wind (8%), nuclear (4%), and solar (3%).\nThermoelectric generation in the SADI is primarily natural gas. However, scarcity of natural gas during winter periods (June to August) due\nto transport constraints result in the use of alternative fuels, such as oil and coal. The SADI is also highly reliant on hydroelectric plants.\nHydrological conditions impact reservoir water levels and largely influence the dispatch of the system's hydroelectric and thermoelectric\ngeneration plants and, therefore, influence market costs. Precipitation in Argentina occurs principally from May to October.\nThe Argentine regulatory framework divides the electricity sector into generation, transmission, and distribution. The wholesale electric\nmarket is comprised of generation companies, transmission companies, distribution companies, and large customers who are permitted to trade\nelectricity. Generation companies can sell their output in the spot market or under PPAs. CAMMESA manages the electricity market and is\nresponsible for dispatch coordination. The Electricity National Regulatory Agency is in charge of regulating public service activities and the\nSecretariat of Energy regulates system framework and grants concessions or authorizations for sector activities. In Argentina, there is a tolling\nscheme in which the regulator establishes prices for electricity and defines fuel reference prices. As a result, our businesses are particularly\nsensitive to changes in regulation.\nThe Argentine electric market is an \"average cost\" system. Generators are compensated for fixed costs and non-fuel variable costs, under\nprices denominated in Argentine pesos. CAMMESA is in charge of providing the natural gas and liquid fuels required by the generation\ncompanies, except for coal.\nThe expansion of renewable capacity in the system is promoted by allowing the new power plants to sign contracts either with CAMMESA\nthrough the RenovAr program or directly by trading energy in the private market.\nDuring 2022, although the government increased prices to the end user, subsidies and the system deficit also increased.

AES Brasil is\nreported in the South America SBU reportable segment.\nKey Financial Drivers — The electricity market in Brazil is highly dependent on hydroelectric generation, therefore electricity pricing is\ndriven by hydrology. Plant availability is also a significant financial driver as in times of high hydrology, AES is more exposed to the spot market.\nAES Brasil's financial results are driven by many factors, including, but not limited to:\n•\nhydrology, impacting quantity of energy generated in the MRE (see Regulatory Framework and Market Structure below for further\ninformation);\n•\ngrowth in demand for energy;\n•\nmarket price risk when re-contracting;\n•\nasset management;\n•\ncost management; and\n•\nability to execute on its growth strategy.\nRegulatory Framework and Market Structure — In Brazil, the Ministry of Mines and Energy determines the maximum amount of energy a\ngeneration plant can sell, called physical guarantee, representing the long-term average expected energy production of the plant. Under current\nrules, physical guarantee energy can be sold to distribution companies through long-term regulated auctions or under unregulated bilateral\ncontracts with large consumers or energy trading companies.\nBrazil has installed capacity of 191 GW, composed of hydroelectric (58%), thermoelectric (25%), renewable (16%), and nuclear (1%)\nsources. Operation is centralized and controlled by the national operator, ONS, and regulated by the Brazilian National Electric Energy Agency\n(\"ANEEL\"). The ONS dispatches generators based on their marginal cost of production and on the risk of system rationing. Key variables for the\ndispatch decision are forecasted hydrological conditions, reservoir levels, electricity demand, fuel prices, and thermal generation availability.\nIn case of unfavorable hydrology, the ONS will reduce hydroelectric dispatch to preserve reservoir levels and increase dispatch of thermal\nplants to meet demand. The consequences of unfavorable hydrology are (i) higher energy spot prices due to higher energy production costs at\nthermal plants and (ii) the need for hydro plants to purchase energy in the spot market to fulfill their contractual obligations.\nA mechanism known as the MRE (Energy Reallocation Mechanism) was created under ONS to share hyd",

Under the law, compensation was in the form of an offer for a concession extension for each hydro generator\nin exchange for full payment of billed GSF trade payables, the amount of which was reduced in conjunction with the payment for a concession\nextension. On August 12, 2021, ANEEL published Resolution number 2.919/2021, establishing an extension for the end of the concession\noriginally granted to AES Brasil's hydroelectric plants, from 2029 to 2032.

The Company is currently required to comply with the CSAPR in Indiana and Maryland. The CSAPR is implemented in part through a\nmarket-based program under which compliance may be achievable through the acquisition and use of emissions allowances created by the\nEPA. The Company complies with CSAPR through operation of existing controls and purchases of allowances on the open market, as needed.\nIn October 2016, the EPA published a final rule to update the CSAPR to address the 2008 ozone NAAQS (\"CSAPR Update Rule\"). The\nCSAPR Update Rule found that NO  ozone season emissions in 22 states (including Indiana and Maryland, and Ohio) affect the ability of\ndownwind states to attain and maintain the 2008 ozone NAAQS, and, accordingly, the EPA issued federal implementation plans that both\nupdated existing CSAPR NO  ozone season emission budgets for electric generating units within these states and implemented these budgets\nthrough modifications to the CSAPR NO  ozone season allowance trading program. Implementation began in the 2017 ozone season and\naffected facilities began to receive fewer ozone season NO  allowances in 2017. Following legal challenges related to the CSAPR Update Rule,\non April 30, 2021, EPA issued the Revised CSAPR Update Rule. The Revised CSAPR Update Rule required affected EGUs within certain states\n(including Indiana and Maryland) to participate in a new trading program, the CSAPR NO  Ozone Season Group 3 trading program. These\naffected EGUs received fewer ozone season NO  Ozone Season allowances beginning in 2021, which may result in the need for AES affected\nfacilitites to purchase additional allowances.\n2\nx\n2\nX\n2\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nx\nx\n\n\n50 | 2022 Annual Report\nOn April 6, 2022, the EPA published a proposed Federal Implementation Plan (\"FIP\") to address air quality impacts with respect to the 2015\nOzone NAAQS.

In addition to other requirements, if finalized, EGUs in these states would begin receiving fewer allowances as soon as 2023, which\nmay result in the need to purchase additional allowances.\nWhile the Company's additional CSAPR compliance costs to date have been immaterial, the future availability of and cost to purchase\nallowances to meet the emission reduction requirements is uncertain at this time, but it could be material if certain facilities will need to purchase\nadditional allowances based on reduced allocations.\nNew Sou",

On December 20, 2018, the EPA published proposed revisions to the final NSPS for new, modified, and\nreconstructed coal-fired electric utility steam generating units proposing that the best system of emissions reduction for these units is highly\nefficient generation that would be equivalent to supercritical steam conditions for larger units and sub-critical steam conditions for smaller units,\nand not partial carbon capture and sequestration, as was finalized in the 2015 final NSPS. The EPA did not include revisions for natural-gas\ncombined cycle or simple cycle units in the December 20, 2018 proposal.

On July 8, 2019, the EPA published the final ACE\nRule along with associated revisions to implementing regulations. The final ACE Rule established CO emission rules for existing power plants\nunder CAA Section 111(d) and replaced the EPA's 2015 Clean Power Plan Rule (CPP). In accordance with the ACE Rule, the EPA determined\nthat heat rate improvement measures are the best system of emissions reductions for existing coal-fired electric generating units. The final rule\nrequired states, including Indiana and Maryland, to develop a State Plan to establish CO  emission limits for designated facilities, including AES\nIndiana Petersburg's and AES Warrior Run's coal-fired electric generating units. States had three years to develop their plans under the rule.\nHowever, on January 19, 2021, the D.C.

Our insurance does not cover every potential risk associated with our operations. Adequate coverage at\nreasonable rates is not always obtainable.

This level of\nindebtedness and related security could have other consequences, including:\n•\nmaking it more difficult to satisfy debt service and other obligations;\n•\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse industry and economic conditions, including adverse changes in foreign exchange rates,\ninterest rates and commodity prices;\n•\nreducing available cash flow to fund other corporate purposes and grow our business;\n•\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry;\n•\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that are not as highly leveraged; and\n•\nlimiting, along with financial and other restrictive covenants relating to such indebtedness, our ability to borrow additional funds, pay\ncash dividends or repurchase common stock.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness, including the indebtedness of our subsidiaries, limit, but do not prohibit the incurrence of\nadditional indebtedness. If we were to become more leveraged, the risks described above would increase. Further, our actual cash requirements\nmay be greater than expected and our cash flows may not be sufficient to repay all of the outstanding debt as it becomes due. In that event, we\nmay not be able to borrow money, sell assets, raise equity or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms to refinance our debt as it becomes due.\nIn addition, our ability to refinance existing or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at that time. Any\nrefinancing of our debt could result in higher interest rates or more onerous covenants that restrict our business operations. See Note 11—Debt\nincluded in Item 8.—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for a schedule of our debt maturities.\nThe AES Corporation's ability to make payments on its outstanding indebtedness is dependent upon the receipt of\nfunds from our subsidiaries.\nThe AES Corporation is a holding company with no material assets other than the stock of its subsidiaries. Almost all of The AES\nCorporation's cash flow is generated by the operating activities of its subsidiaries. Therefore, The AES Corporation's ability to make payments on\nits indebtedness and to fund its other obligations is dependent not only on the ability of its subsidiaries to generate cash, but also on the ability of\nthe subsidiaries to distribute cash to it in the form of dividends, fees, interest, tax sharing payments, loans or otherwise.Our ",

Most of the subsidiaries are obligated, pursuant to loan agreements, indentures or non-recourse\nfinancing arrangements, to satisfy certain restricted payment covenants or other conditions before they may make distributions. Business\nperformance and local accounting and tax rules may also limit dividend distributions. Subsidiaries in foreign countries may also be prevented\nfrom distributing funds as a result of foreign governments restricting the repatriation of funds or the conversion of currencies. Our subsidiaries\nare separate and distinct legal entities and, unless they have expressly guaranteed The AES Corporation's indebtedness, have no obligation,\ncontingent or otherwise, to pay any amounts due pursuant to such debt or to make any funds available whether by dividends, fees, loans or\nother payments.\nExisting and potential future defaults by subsidiaries or affiliates could adversely affect us.\nWe attempt to finance our domestic and foreign projects through non-recourse debt or \"non-recourse financing\" that requires the loans to\nbe repaid solely from the project's revenues and provide that the repayment of the loans (and interest thereon) is secured solely by the capital\nstock, physical assets, contracts and cash flow of that project subsidiary or affiliate. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $23 billion\nof outstanding indebtedness on a consolidated basis, of which approximately $3.9 billion was recourse debt of the Parent Company and\napproximately $19.4 billion was non-recourse debt. In some non-recourse financings, the Parent Company has explicitly agreed, in the form of\nguarantees, indemnities, letters of credit, letter of credit reimbursement agreements and agreements to pay, to undertake certain limited\nobligations and contingent liabilities, most of which will only be effective or will be terminated upon the occurrence of future events.\nCertain of our subsidiaries are in default with respect to all or a portion of their outstanding indebtedness. The total debt classified as\ncurrent in our Consolidated Balance Sheets related to such defaults was $177 million as of December 31, 2022. While the lenders under our\nnon-recourse financings generally do not have direct recourse to the Parent Company, such defaults under non-recourse financings can:\n•\nreduce the Parent Company's receipt of subsidiary dividends, fees, interest payments, loans and other sources of cash because a\nsubsidiary will typically be prohibited from distributing cash to the Parent Company during the pendency of any default;\n•\ntrigger The AES Corporation's obligation to make payments under any financial guarantee, letter of credit or other credit support\nprovided to or on behalf of such subsidiary;\n•\ntrigger defaults in the Parent Company's outstanding debt.

The alleged charges include untimely implementation of road\nimprovement measures and road use schedules and the failure to identify all noise receptors closest to the first construction phases of the\nproject. On June 23, 2022, the SMA addressed the charges to Energía Eólica Mesamávida SpA. On June 28, 2022, Energía Eólica Mesamávida\nSpA submitted a proposed compliance program, with an estimated cost of $4.3 million, which was subsequently approved by the SMA. On\nNovember 9, 2022, opponents to the project submitted before the Third Environmental Court a judicial action challenging the approval of this\ncompliance program.

The Alto Maipo project intends to submit a compliance program for consideration by the SMA. The costs of any such compliance program\nare uncertain.

This loss increase reflects\nthe prior year gains on remeasurement of our interest in sPower's development platform and the Fluence capital raise, higher income tax\nexpense, lower contributions from our US and Utilities SBU due to the recognition of previously deferred power purchase costs and impacts of\noutages, the prior year impact of realized gains on de-designated interest rate swaps at the Parent Company, higher interest expense, and lower\ncapitalized interest at construction projects in Chile; partially offset by the prior year loss on deconsolidation of Alto Maipo, and higher margins\nfrom our MCAC SBU due to favorable LNG transactions.\nAdjusted EPS, a non-GAAP measure, increased $0.15, from $1.52 to $1.67, mainly driven by higher contributions from our MCAC SBU due\nto favorable LNG transactions and from our South America SBU due to higher margins and increased ownership in AES Andes, partially offset\nby lower contributions from our US and Utilities SBU due to the recognition of previously deferred power purchase costs and impacts of outages,\nthe prior year impact of realized gains on de-designated interest rate swaps at the Parent Company, and higher interest expense.\n\n\n84 | 2022 Annual Report\nReview of Consolidated Results of Operations\nYears Ended December 31,\n2022\n2021\n2020\n% Change 2022 vs.\n2021\n% Change 2021 vs.\n2020\n(in millions, except per share amounts)\nRevenue:\nUS and Utilities SBU\n$\n5,013 \n$\n4,335 \n$\n3,918 \n16 %\n11 %\nSouth America SBU\n3,539 \n3,541 \n3,159 \n— %\n12 %\nMCAC SBU\n2,868 \n2,157 \n1,766 \n33 %\n22 %\nEurasia SBU\n1,217 \n1,123 \n828 \n8 %\n36 %\nCorporate and Other\n119 \n116 \n231 \n3 %\n-50 %\nEliminations\n(139)\n(131)\n(242)\n6 %\n-46 %\nTotal Revenue\n12,617 \n11,141 \n9,660 \n13 %\n15 %\nOperating Margin:\nUS and Utilities SBU\n564 \n792 \n638 \n-29 %\n24 %\nSouth America SBU\n823 \n1,069 \n1,243 \n-23 %\n-14 %\nMCAC SBU\n820 \n521 \n559 \n57 %\n-7 %\nEurasia SBU\n236 \n216 \n186 \n9 %\n16 %\nCorporate and Other\n175 \n158 \n120 \n11 %\n32 %\nEliminations\n(70)\n(45)\n(53)\n56 %\n-15 %\nTotal Operating Margin\n2,548 \n2,711 \n2,693 \n-6 %\n1 %\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n(207)\n(166)\n(165)\n25 %\n1 %\nInterest expense\n(1,117)\n(911)\n(1,038)\n23 %\n-12 %\nInterest income\n389 \n298 \n268 \n31 %\n11 %\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\n(15)\n(78)\n(186)\n-81 %\n-58 %\nOther expense\n(68)\n(60)\n(53)\n13 %\n13 %\nOther income\n102 \n410 \n75 \n-75 %\nNM\nLoss on disposal and sale of bus",

Commerce also evaluated numerous individual companies and issued preliminary determinations that\ncircumvention had occurred with respect to many but not all of these companies. Additionally, Commerce issued a preliminary determination that\ncircumvention would not be deemed to occur for any solar cells and panels imported from the four countries if the wafers were manufactured\noutside of China or if no more than two out of six specifically identified components were produced in China. These preliminary determinations\ncould be modified and final determinations from Commerce are expected in May 2023. We have contracted and secured our expected\nrequirements for solar panels for U.S. projects targeted to achieve commercial operations in 2023.\nAdditionally, the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (“UFLPA”) seeks to block the import of products made with forced labor in certain\nareas of China and may lead to certain suppliers being blocked from importing solar cells and panels to the U.S. While this has impacted the\nU.S. market, AES has managed this issue without significant impact to our projects. Further disruptions may impact our suppliers’ ability or\nwillingness to meet their contractual agreements or to continue to supply cells or panels into the U.S. market on terms that we deem satisfactory.\nThe impact of any adverse Commerce determination, the impact of the UFLPA, future disruptions to the solar panel supply chain and their\neffect on AES’ U.S. solar project development and construction activities are uncertain.

The IRA includes provisions that are expected to benefit the U.S. clean energy industry, including increases, extensions\nand/or new tax credits for onshore and offshore wind, solar, storage and hydrogen projects. We expect that the extension of the current solar\ninvestment tax credits (\"ITCs\"), as well as higher credits available for projects that satisfy wage and apprenticeship requirements, will increase\ndemand for our renewables products.\nOur U.S. renewables business has a 51 GW pipeline that we intend to utilize to continue to grow our business, and these changes in tax\npolicy are supportive of this strategy. We account for U.S. renewables projects according to U.S. GAAP, which, when partnering with tax-equity\ninvestors to monetize tax benefits, utilizes the HLBV method. This method recognizes the tax-credit value that is transferred to tax equity\npartners at the time of its creation, which for projects utilizing the investment tax credit is in the quarter the project begins commercial operation.\nFor projects utilizing the production tax credit, this value is recognized over 10 years as the facility produces energy.

This could result in significant impacts to tax law. For example, on July 1, 2022, the Chilean\ngovernment proposed to reduce the corporate tax rate from 27% to 25%, limit net operating loss utilization per year, and introduce a\ndisintegrated system whereby dividends may be subject to a 22% withholding tax, among other changes. The potential impact to the\nCompany may be material.\nIn the U.S., the IRA includes a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax based on adjusted financial statement income. We are currently\nevaluating the applicability and effect of the new law and additional guidance issued in the fourth quarter of 2022.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, the European Commission adopted an amended Directive on Pillar 2 establishing a global minimum tax at a\n15% rate. The adoption requires EU Member States to transpose the Directive into their respective national laws by December 31, 2023 for the\nrules to come into effect as of January 1, 2024. We will continue to monitor issuance of draft legislation in Bulgaria and other relevant EU\nMember States.

While most of our contracts in our\ninternational businesses are indexed to inflation, in general, our U.S.-based generation contracts are not indexed to inflation. If inflation\ncontinues to increase in our markets, it may increase our expenses that we may not be able to pass through to customers. It may also increase\nthe costs of some of our development projects that could negatively impact their competitiveness. Our utility businesses do allow for recovering\nof operations and maintenance costs through the regulatory process, which may have timing impacts on recovery.\nReference Rate Reform — In July 2017, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority announced that it intends to phase out\nLIBOR.

The PPA Discussions are ongoing and the PPA continues to remain in place. However, there can be no\nassurance that, in the context of the PPA Discussions, the other parties will not seek a prompt termination of the PPA.\nWe do not believe termination of the PPA is justified. Nevertheless, the PPA Discussions involve a range of potential outcomes, including\nbut not limited to the termination of the PPA and payment of some level of compensation to AES Maritza. Any negotiated resolution would be\nsubject to mutually acceptable terms, lender consent, and DG Comp approval. At this time, we cannot predict the outcome of the PPA\nDiscussions or when those discussions will conclude. Nor can we predict how DG Comp might resolve its review if the PPA Discussions fail to\nresult in an agreement concerning the agency's review.

The amounts involved in any\nsuch repurchases may be material.\nWe rely mainly on long-term debt obligations to fund our construction activities. We have, to the extent available at acceptable terms,\nutilized non-recourse debt to fund a significant portion of the capital expenditures and investments required to construct and acquire our electric\npower plants, distribution companies, and related assets. Our non-recourse financing is designed to limit cross-default risk to the Parent\nCompany or other subsidiaries and affiliates. Our non-recourse long-term debt is a combination of fixed and variable interest rate instruments.\nDebt is typically denominated in the currency that matches the currency of the revenue expected to be generated from the benefiting project,\nthereby reducing currency risk. In certain cases, the currency is matched through the use of derivative instruments. The majority of our non-\nrecourse debt is funded by international commercial banks, with debt capacity supplemented by multilaterals and local regional banks.\nGiven our long-term debt obligations, the Company is subject to interest rate risk on debt balances that accrue interest at variable rates.\nWhen possible, the Company will borrow funds at fixed interest rates or hedge its variable rate debt to fix its interest costs on such obligations. In\naddition, the Company has historically tried to maintain at least 70% of its consolidated long-term obligations at fixed interest rates, including\nfixing the interest rate through the use of interest rate swaps. These efforts apply to the notional amount of the swaps compared to the amount of\nrelated underlying debt. Presently, the Parent Company's only material unhedged exposure to variable interest rate debt relates to drawings of\n$325 million under its revolving credit facility and a $200 million senior unsecured term loan. On a consolidated basis, of the Company's $23.7\nbillion of total gross debt outstanding as of December 31, 2022, approximately $6 billion bore interest at variable rates that were not subject to a\nderivative instrument which fixed the interest rate. Brazil holds $2 billion of our floating rate non-recourse exposure as variable rate instruments\nact as a natural hedge against inflation in Brazil.\nIn addition to utilizing non-recourse debt at a subsidiary level when available, the Parent Company provides a portion, or in certain\ninstances all, of the remaining long-term financing or credit required to fund development, construction or acquisition of a particular project.\nThese investments have generally taken the form of equity investments or intercompany loans, which are subordinated to the project's non-\nrecourse loans.

AES' significant accounting policies are described in Note 1—General and Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8.—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of\nthis Form 10-K.\nAn accounting estimate is considered critical if the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly\nuncertain at the time the estimate was made, different estimates reasonably could have been used, or the impact of the estimates and\nassumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material.\nManagement believes that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, actual\nresults could materially differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods.

The Company regularly assesses the potential outcome of these examinations in each tax jurisdiction when determining the adequacy of\nthe provision for income taxes. Accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes a more likely than not recognition threshold. Tax\nreserves have been established, which the Company believes to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments. Once\nestablished, reserves are adjusted only when there is more information available or when an event occurs necessitating a change to the\nreserves. While the Company believes that the amounts of the tax estimates are reasonable, it is possible that the ultimate outcome of current or\nfuture examinations may be materially different than the reserve amounts.\nBecause we have a wide range of statutory tax rates in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, any changes in our geographical\nearnings mix could materially impact our effective tax rate. Furthermore, our tax position could be adversely impacted by changes in tax laws,\ntax treaties or tax regulations, or the interpretation or enforcement thereof and such changes may be more likely or become more likely in view of\nrecent economic trends in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate.\n(1)\n\n\n118 | 2022 Annual Report\nIn addition, no taxes have been recorded on undistributed earnings for certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries to the extent such earnings are\nconsidered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries. Should the earnings be remitted as dividends, the Company may\nbe subject to additional foreign withholding and state income taxes.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement\ncarrying amounts of the existing assets and liabilities, and their respective income tax bases. The Company establishes a valuation allowance\nwhen it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company has elected to treat GILTI as an\nexpense in the period in which the tax is accrued. Accordingly, no deferred tax assets or liabilities are recorded related to GILTI.\nIn addition, the Company has elected an accounting policy not to consider the effects of being subject to the corporate alternative minimum\ntax in future periods when assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets, carryforwards, and tax credits.

The Company exercises judgment in determining if these indicators or events represent an impairment indicator requiring the\ncomputation of the fair value of goodwill and/or the recoverability of long-lived assets. The fair value determination is typically the most\njudgmental part in an impairment evaluation. Please see Fair Value below for further detail.\nAs part of the impairment evaluation process, management analyzes the sensitivity of fair value to various underlying assumptions. The\nlevel of scrutiny increases as the gap between fair value and carrying amount decreases. Changes in any of these assumptions could result in\nmanagement reaching a different conclusion regarding the potential impairment, which could be material. Our impairment evaluations inherently\ninvolve uncertainties from uncontrollable events that could positively or negatively impact the anticipated future economic and operating\nconditions.\nFurther discussion of the impairment charges recognized by the Company can be found within Note 9—Goodwill and Other Intangible\nAssets and Note 22—Asset Impairment Expense to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nDepreciation — Depreciation, after consideration of salvage value and asset retirement obligations, is computed using the straight-line\nmethod over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are determined on a composite or component basis. The Company considers many\nfactors in its estimate of useful lives, including expected usage, physical deterioration, technological changes, existence and length of off-taker\nagreements, and laws and regulations, among others. In certain circumstances, these estimates involve significant judgment and require\nmanagement to forecast the impact of relevant factors over an extended time horizon.\nUseful life estimates are continually evaluated for appropriateness as changes in the relevant factors arise, including when a long-lived\nasset group is tested for recoverability. Depreciation studies are performed periodically for assets subject to composite depreciation. Any change\nto useful lives is considered a change in accounting estimate and is made on a prospective basis.\nFair Value — For information regarding the fair value hierarchy, see Note 1—General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nincluded in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments — A significant number of the Company's financial instruments are carried at fair value with\nchanges in fair value recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income each period. Investments are generally fair valued based on quoted\nmarket prices or other observable market data such as interest rate indices.

The Company generally utilizes the\nincome approach to value nonfinancial assets and liabilities, specifically a Discounted Cash Flow (\"DCF\") model to estimate fair value by\ndiscounting cash flow forecasts, adjusted to reflect market participant assumptions, to the extent necessary, at an appropriate discount rate.\nManagement applies considerable judgment in selecting several input assumptions during the development of our cash flow forecasts.\nExamples of the input assumptions that our forecasts are sensitive to include macroeconomic factors such as growth rates, industry demand,\ninflation, exchange rates, power prices, rising interest rates, and commodity prices. Whenever appropriate, management obtains these input\nassumptions from observable market data sources (e.g., Economic Intelligence Unit) and extrapolates the market information if an input\nassumption is not observable for the entire forecast period. Many of these input assumptions are dependent on other economic assumptions,\nwhich are often derived from statistical economic models with inherent limitations such as estimation differences. Further, several input\nassumptions are based on historical trends which often do not recur. It is not uncommon that different market data sources have different views\nof the macroeconomic factor expectations and related assumptions. As a result, macroeconomic factors and related assumptions are often\navailable in a narrow range; however, in some situations these ranges become wide and the use of a different set of input assumptions could\nproduce significantly different budgets and cash flow forecasts.\nA considerable amount of judgment is also applied in the estimation of the discount rate used in the DCF model. To the extent practical,\ninputs to the discount rate are obtained from market data sources (e.g., Bloomberg). The Company selects and uses a set of publicly traded\ncompanies from the relevant industry to estimate the discount rate inputs. Management applies judgment in the selection of such companies\nbased on its view of the most likely market participants. It is reasonably possible th",

We primarily use derivative instruments to manage our interest rate, commodity, and foreign currency\nexposures. We do not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes. See Note 6—Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nincluded in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information on the classification.\nThe fair value measurement standard requires the Company to consider and reflect the assumptions of market participants in the fair value\ncalculation. These factors include nonperformance risk (the risk that the obligation will not be fulfilled) and credit risk, both of the reporting entity\n(for liabilities) and of the counterparty (for assets). Credit risk for AES is evaluated at the level of the entity that is party to the contract.\nNonperformance risk on the Company's derivative instruments is an adjustment to the fair value position that is derived from internally developed\nvaluation models that utilize market inputs that may or may not be observable.\nAs a result of uncertainty, complexity, and judgment, accounting estimates related to derivative accounting could result in material changes\nto our financial statements under different conditions or utilizing different assumptions. As a part of accounting for these derivatives, we make\nestimates concerning nonperformance, volatilities, market liquidity, future commodity prices, interest rates, credit ratings, and future foreign\nexchange rates. Refer to Note 5—Fair Value included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional details.\nThe fair value of our derivative portfolio is generally determined using internal and third party valuation models, most of which are based on\nobservable market inputs, including interest rate curves and forward and spot prices for currencies and commodities. The Company derives\nmost of its financial instrument market assumptions from market efficient data sources (e.g., Bloomberg, Reuters, and Platt's). In some cases,\nwhere market data is not readily available, management uses comparable market sources and empirical evidence to derive market assumptions\nto determine a financial instrument's fair value. In certain instances, published pricing may not extend through the remaining term of the contract,\nand management must make assumptions to extrapolate the curve. Specifically, where there is limited forward curve data with respect to foreign\nexchange contracts beyond the traded points, the Company utilizes the interest rate differential approach to construct the remaining portion of\nthe forward curve.

If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, any asset write-offs would be required to be recognized in operating\nincome.\nConsolidation — The Company enters into transactions impacting the Company's equity interests in its affiliates. In connection with each\ntransaction, the Company must determine whether the transaction impacts the Company's consolidation conclusion by first determining whether\nthe transaction should be evaluated under the variable interest model or the voting model. In determining which consolidation model applies to\nthe transaction, the Company is required to make judgments about how the entity operates, the most significant of which are whether (i) the\nentity has sufficient equity to finance its activities, (ii) the equity holders, as a group, have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest,\nand (iii) whether the entity has non-substantive voting rights.\nIf the entity is determined to be a variable interest entity, the most significant judgment in determining whether the Company must\nconsolidate the entity is whether the Company, including its related parties and de facto agents, collectively have power and benefits. If AES is\ndetermined to have power and benefits, the entity will be consolidated by AES.\nAlternatively, if the entity is determined to be a voting model entity, the most significant judgments involve determining whether the non-AES\nshareholders have substantive participating rights. The assessment of shareholder rights and whether they are substantive participating rights\nrequires significant judgment since the rights provided under shareholders' agreements may include selecting, terminating, and setting the\ncompensation of management responsible for implementing the subsidiary's policies and procedures, and establishing operating and capital\ndecisions of the entity, including budgets, in the ordinary course of business. On the other hand, if shareholder rights are only protective in nature\n(referred to as protective rights), then such rights would not overcome the presumption that the owner of a majority voting interest shall\nconsolidate its investee. Significant judgment is required to determine whether minority rights represent substantive participating rights or\nprotective rights that do not affect the evaluation of control.

Our primary market risk exposure is to the price of commodities,\nparticularly electricity, oil, natural gas, coal, and environmental credits. In addition, our businesses are exposed to lower electricity prices due to\nincreased competition, including from renewable sources such as wind and solar, as a result of lower costs of entry and lower variable costs. We\noperate in multiple countries and as such are subject to volatility in exchange rates at varying degrees at the subsidiary level and between our\nfunctional currency, the USD, and currencies of the countries in which we operate. We are also exposed to interest rate fluctuations due to our\nissuance of debt and related financial instruments.\nThe disclosures presented in this Item 7A are based upon a number of assumptions; actual effects may differ. The safe harbor provided in\nSection 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Exchange Act shall apply to the disclosures contained in this Item 7A.

We employ risk management\nstrategies to hedge our financial performance against the effects of fluctuations in energy commodity prices. The implementation of these\nstrategies can involve the use of physical and financial commodity contracts, futures, swaps, and options.\nThe portion of our sales and purchases that are not subject to such agreements or contracted businesses where indexation is not perfectly\nmatched to business drivers will be exposed to commodity price risk. When hedging the output of our generation assets, we utilize contract sales\nthat lock in the spread per MWh between variable costs and the price at which the electricity can be sold.\nAES businesses will see changes in variable margin performance as global commodity prices shift. For 2023, we project pre-tax earnings\nexposure on a 10% (uncorrelated) move in commodity prices to be approximately a $5 million gain for power, a $10 million loss for oil, and a $5\nmillion loss for coal and natural gas. Our estimates exclude correlation of oil with coal or natural gas. For example, a decline in oil or natural gas\nprices can be accompanied by a decline in coal price if commodity prices are correlated. In aggregate, the Company's downside exposure\noccurs with lower power, lower oil, higher natural gas, and higher coal prices. Exposures at individual businesses will change as new contracts\nor financial hedges are executed, and our sensitivity to changes in commodity prices generally increases in later years with reduced hedge\nlevels at some of our businesses.\n\n\n122 | 2022 Annual Report\nCommodity prices affect our businesses differently depending on the local market characteristics and risk management strategies. Spot\npower prices, contract indexation provisions, and generation costs can be directly or indirectly affected by movements in the price of natural gas,\noil, and coal. We have some natural offsets across our businesses such that low commodity prices may benefit certain businesses and be a cost\nto others. Exposures are not perfectly linear or symmetric. The sensitivities are affected by a number of local or indirect market factors.\nExamples of these factors include hydrology, local energy market supply/demand balances, regional fuel supply issues, regional competition,\nbidding strategies, and regulatory interventions such as price caps. Operational flexibility changes the shape of our sensitivities. For instance,\ncertain power plants may limit downside exposure by reducing dispatch in low market environments. Volume variation also affects our\ncommodity exposure. The volume sold under contracts or retail concessions can vary based on weather and economic conditions, resulting in a\nhigher or lower volume of sales in spot markets. Thermal unit availability and hydrology can affect the generation output available for sale and\ncan affect the marginal unit setting power prices.\nIn the US and Utilit",

These assets have contracts in capacity and have seen incremental value in energy revenues.\nIn the South America SBU, our business in Chile owns assets in the central and northern regions of the country and has a portfolio of\ncontract sales in both. The significant portion of our PPAs include mechanisms of indexation that adjust the price of energy based on fluctuations\nin the price of coal, with the specific indices and timing varying by contract, in order to mitigate changes in the price of fuel.

In Colombia, we operate under a shorter-term sales strategy with spot market exposure for uncontracted volumes. Because we own\nhydroelectric assets there, contracts are not indexed to fuel. Additionally, in Brazil, the hydroelectric generating facility is covered by contract\nsales. Under normal hydrological volatility, spot price risk is mitigated through a regulated sharing mechanism across all hydroelectric generators\nin the country. Under drier conditions, the sharing mechanism may not be sufficient to cover the business' contract position, and therefore it may\nhave to purchase power at spot prices driven by the cost of thermal generation.\nIn the MCAC SBU, our businesses have commodity exposure on unhedged volumes. Panama is highly contracted under financial and\nload-following PPA type structures, exposing the business to hydrology-based variance.

We assessed the historical accuracy of management’s estimates and performed sensitivity analyses\nof significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in the fair value of the reporting units that would result from changes\nin the assumptions. We also involved valuation specialists to assist in our evaluation of the overall methodologies and\nthe discount rates used in the fair value estimate.\nLong-lived Asset Impairments and Re-evaluation of Useful Lives\nDescription of the\nMatter\nAt December 31, 2022, the Company's net property, plant and equipment was $23,039 million. As discussed in Note 1 to\nthe consolidated financial statements, when circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long-lived assets in a\nheld-for-use asset group may not be recoverable, the Company evaluates the assets for potential impairment. Events or\nchanges in circumstances that may necessitate a recoverability evaluation include, but are not limited to, adverse\nchanges in the regulatory environment, unfavorable changes in power prices or fuel costs, increased competition due to\nadditional capacity in the grid, technological advancements, declining trends in demand, or an expectation it is more\nlikely than not that the asset will be disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life. If the carrying\namount of the assets exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment is recognized for the amount by which the\ncarrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value. The Company’s useful life estimates are continually evaluated\nfor appropriateness as changes in the relevant factors arise, including when a long-lived asset group is t",

As discussed in Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognized a total asset\nimpairment expense of $661 million related to the Maritza and the TEG TEP asset groups in 2022.\n\n\n127 | 2022 Annual Report\nAuditing the Company's identification of impairment indicators and re-evaluation of useful lives was complex and highly\njudgmental because of the many geographic, regulatory, and economic environments in which the Company operates.\nAlso, due to the wide variety of events or changes in circumstances that may indicate that an asset group is not\nrecoverable or that may result in a change in useful life, auditing the Company’s identification of impairment indicators\nand re-evaluation of useful lives involved a high degree of subjectivity, particularly given the Company’s decarbonization\ninitiatives and shift towards clean energy platforms. In addition, auditing the Company’s valuation of long-lived assets\nused in the Maritza and TEG TEP impairment analyses involved significant judgment due to the significant unobservable\ninputs used in the estimation of the asset groups’ fair value. In particular, the significant assumptions for the income\napproach used to determine the fair value of the asset groups included the Company’s projections of revenue growth\nand discount rates, which are forward-looking assumptions and could be affected by future industry, market, and\neconomic conditions.\nHow We\nAddressed the\nMatter in Our Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company’s controls\nover the identification of impairment indicators, re-evaluation of estimated useful lives, and the valuation of the Maritza\nand TEG TEP long-lived asset impairments. For example, we tested management’s monitoring controls over the\nevaluation of events or changes in circumstances that would require an asset to be tested for recoverability. We also\ntested management’s review controls of the valuation models used in the impairment analyses, the significant\nassumptions used to develop the estimates, and the completeness and accuracy of the data used in the valuations.\nTo test the Company's identification of impairment indicators and re-evaluation of useful lives, our audit procedures\nincluded, among others, making inquiries of management, including personnel in operations, to understand changes in\nthe businesses and management’s strategic plans, and evaluate whether management has considered any identified\nchanges in their analysis. We evaluated the results of earnings and the projected cash flows for significant coal\ngeneration assets and assessed whether there has been a deterioration in earnings or projected losses that would\nrepresent an impairment indicator. We also evaluated conditions and trends in the industry for the underlying\neconomies, including any sale or disposition activities, and evaluated any adverse changes in the regulatory\nenvironment",

GENERAL AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe AES Corporation is a holding company (the \"Parent Company\") that, through its subsidiaries and affiliates, (collectively, \"AES\" or \"the\nCompany\") operates a geographically diversified portfolio of electricity generation and distribution businesses. Generally, the liabilities of\nindividual operating entities are non-recourse to the Parent Company and are isolated to the operating entities. Most of our operating entities are\nstructured as limited liability entities, which limit the liability of shareholders. The structure is generally the same regardless of whether a\nsubsidiary is consolidated under a voting or variable interest model. The preparation of the",

          "chunk": "e preparation of these consolidated financial statements is in conformity\nwith accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\").\nPRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION — The consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of The AES\nCorporation and its controlled subsidiaries. Furthermore, VIEs in which the Company has an ownership interest and is the primary beneficiary,\nthus controlling the VIE, have been consolidated. Intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. Investments in\nentities where the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, are accounted for using the equity method of\naccounting.\nNONCONTROLLING INTERESTS — Noncontrolling interests are classified as a separate component of equity in the Consolidated\nBalance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity. Additionally, net income and comprehensive income attributable to\nnoncontrolling interests are reflected separately from consolidated net income and comprehensive income on the Consolidated Statements of\nOperations and Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity. Any change in ownership of a subsidiary while the controlling financial interest is\nretained is accounted for as an equity transaction between the controlling and noncontrolling interests. Losses continue to be attributed to the\nnoncontrolling interests, even when the noncontrolling interests' basis has been reduced to zero.\nEquity securities with redemption features that are not solely within the control of the issuer are classified as temporary equity and are\nincluded in Redeemable stock of subsidiaries on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Generally, initial measurement will be at fair value. The\nsubsequent allocation of income and dividends is classified in temporary equity. Subsequent measurement and classification vary depending on\nwhether the instrument is probable of becoming redeemable. For those securities that are currently redeemable or where it is probable that the\ninstrument will become redeemable, AES recognizes any changes from the carrying value to redemption value at each reporting period against\nretained earnings or additional paid-in capital in the absence of retained earnings; such adjustments are classified in temporary equity. When the\nequity instrument is not probable of becoming redeemable, no adjustment to the carrying value is recognized. Instruments that are mandatorily\nredeemable are classified as a liability.\nEQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS — Investments in entities over which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence, but\nnot control, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and reported in Investments in and advances to affiliates on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheets. The Company’s proportionate share of the net income or loss of these companies is included in Net equity in\nlosses of affiliates on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe Compan",

The Company discontinues the application of the equity method when an investment is reduced\nto zero and the Company is not otherwise committed to provide further financial support to the investee. The Company resumes the application\nof the equity method accounting to the extent that net income is greater than the share of net losses not previously recorded.\nUpon acquiring the investment, we determine the fair value of the identifiable assets and assumed liabilities and the basis difference\nbetween each fair value and the carrying amount of the corresponding asset or liability in the financial statements of the investee. The AES\nshare of the amortization of the basis difference is recognized in Net equity in losses of affiliates in the Consolidated Statements of Operations\nover the life of the asset or liability.\nThe Company periodically assesses if impairment indicators exist at our equity method investments.

Losses on expected sales of\nbusiness interests are limited to the impairment of long-lived assets as of the date of execution of the sales agreement, which are recognized in\nAsset impairment expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Any gains/(losses) upon the completion of disposals, which include\nreclassification of cumulative translation adjustments, are recognized in Loss on disposal and sale of business interests in the Consolidated\nStatements of Operations upon completion of the sale.\nALLOCATION OF EARNINGS — Certain of the Company's businesses are subject to profit-sharing arrangements where the allocation of\ncash distributions and the sharing of tax benefits are not based on fixed ownership percentages. These arrangements exist for certain U.S.\nrenewable generation partnerships to designate different allocations of value among investors, where the allocations change in form or\npercentage over the life of the partnership. For these businesses, the Company uses the hypothetical liquidation at book value (“HLBV”) method\nwhen it is a reasonable approximation of the profit-sharing arrangement. The HLBV method calculates the proceeds that would be attributable to\neach partner based on the liquidation provisions of the respective operating partn",

Each partner’s share of income in the period is equal to the change in the amount of net equity they are\nlegally able to claim based on a hypothetical liquidation of the entity at the end of a reporting period compared to the beginning of that period,\nadjusted for any capital transactions.\nThe HLBV method is used both to allocate the equity earnings attributable to AES when the Company accounts for the renewable business\nas an equity method investment and to calculate the earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest when the business is consolidated by AES. In\nthe early months of operations of a renewable generation facility where HLBV results in a significant decrease in the hypothetical liquidation\nproceeds attributable to the tax equity investor due to the recognition of investment tax credits (\"ITCs\") or other adjustments as required by the\nU.S. Internal Revenue Code, the Company records the impact (sometimes referred to as the ‘Day one gain’) to income in the same period.\nUSE OF ESTIMATES — U.S. GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the asset and liability balances\nreported as of the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the revenues and expenses recognized during the reporting period.\nActual results could differ from those estimates. Items subject to such estimates and assumptions include: the carrying amount and estimated\nuseful lives of long-lived assets; asset retirement obligations; impairment of goodwill, long-lived assets and equity method investments; valuation\nallowances for receivables and deferred tax assets; the recoverability of regulatory assets; regulatory liabilities; the fair value of financial\ninstruments; the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired as business combinations or as asset acquisitions by variable interest entities;\ncontingent consideration arising from business combinations or asset acquisitions by variable interest entities; the measurement of equity\nmethod investments or noncontrolling interest using the HLBV method for certain renewable generation partnerships; pension liabilities; the\nincremental borrowing rates used in the determination of lease liabilities; the determination of lease and non-lease components in certain\ngeneration contracts; environmental liabilities; and potential litigation claims and settlements.\nHELD-FOR-SALE DISPOSAL GROUPS — A disposal group classified as held-for-sale is reflected on the balance sheet at the lower of its\ncarrying amount or estimated fair value less cost to sell. A loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the disposal group exceeds its estimated\nfair value less cost to sell. This loss is limited to the carrying value of long-lived assets until the completion of the sale, at which point, any\nadditional loss is recognized.

Assets and liabilities of held-for-sale disposal groups are classified as current when they\nare expected to be disposed of within twelve months. Transactions between the held-for-sale disposal group and businesses that are expected\nto continue to exist after the disposal are not eliminated to appropriately reflect the continuing operations and balances held-for-sale.

The Company\nreports financial results for discontinued operations separately from continuing operations to distinguish the financial impact of disposal\ntransactions from ongoing operations. Prior period amounts in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets are\nretrospectively revised to reflect the businesses determined to be discontinued operations. The cash flows of businesses that are determined to\nbe discontinued operations are included within the relevant categories within operating, investing and financing activities on the face of the\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows. \nTransactions between the businesses determined to be discontinued operations and businesses that are expected to continue to exist after\nthe disposal are not eliminated to appropriately reflect the continuing operations and balances held-for-sale. The results of discontinued\noperations include any gain or loss recognized on closing or adjustment of the carrying amount to fair value less cost to sell, including gains or\nlosses associated with noncontrolling interests upon completion of the disposal transaction. Adjustments related to components previously\nreported as discontinued operations under prior accounting guidance are presented as discontinued operations in the current period even if the\ndisposed-of component to which the adjustments are related would not meet the criteria for presentation as a discontinued operation under\ncurrent guidance.\nFAIR VALUE — Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly, hypothetical\ntransaction between market participants at the measurement date, or exit price.

The\nCompany applies the fair value measurement guidance to nonfinancial assets and liabilities upon the acquisition of a business or of an asset\nacquisition by a variable interest entity, or in conjunction with the measurement of an asset retirement obligation or a potential impairment loss\non an asset group, equity method investments, or goodwill.\nWhen determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required to be reflected at their fair values, the Company considers\nthe principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and considers assumptions that market participants would use when\npricing the assets or liabilities, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions and risk of nonperformance. The Company is prohibited from including\ntransaction costs and any adjustments for blockage factors in determining fair value.\nIn determining fair value measurements, the Company maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable\ninputs. Assets and liabilities are categorized within a fair value hierarchy based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value\nmeasurement:\n• Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\n• Level 2: Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets\nor liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can\nbe corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; or\n• Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair values of the assets or\nliabilities.\nAny transfers between all levels within the fair value hierarchy levels are recognized at the end of the reporting period.\nCASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS — The Company considers unrestricted cash on hand, cash balances not restricted as to withdrawal or\nusage, deposits in banks, certificates of deposit and short-term marketable securities with original maturities of three months or less to be cash\nand cash equivalents.\nRESTRICTED CASH AND DEBT SERVICE RESERVES — Cash balances restricted as to withdrawal or usage, primarily via contract, are\nconsidered restricted cash.\n\n\n136 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020\nThe following table provides a summary of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash amounts reported on the Consol",

Marketable debt securities where the Company has both the positive intent and ability to hold to\nmaturity are classified as held-to-maturity and are carried at amortized cost, net of any allowance for credit losses in accordance with ASC 326.\nRemaining marketable debt securities are classified as available-for-sale or trading and are carried at fair value.\nUnrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale debt securities that are not credit-related are reflected in AOCL, a separate component of\nequity, and the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). Any credit-related impairments are recognized as an allowance with\na corresponding impact recognized as a credit loss in Other Expense. Unrealized gains or losses on equity investments are reported in Other\nincome. Interest and dividends on investments are reported in Interest income and Other income, respectively. Gains and losses on sales of\ninvestments are determined using the specific identification method.\nACCOUNTS AND NOTES RECEIVABLE AND ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS — Accounts and notes receivable are\ncarried at amortized cost. The Company periodically assesses the collectability of accounts receivable, considering factors such as historical\ncollection experience, the age of accounts receivable and other currently available evidence supporting collectability, and records an allowance\nfor doubtful accounts in accordance with ASC 326 for the estimated uncollectible amount as appropriate. Credit losses on accounts and notes\nreceivable are generally recognized in Cost of Sales. Certain of our businesses charge interest on accounts receivable.

The cost of renewals\nand improvements that extend the useful life of property, plant and equipment are capitalized.\nConstruction progress payments, engineering costs, insurance costs, salaries, interest and other costs directly relating to construction in\nprogress are capitalized during the construction period, provided the completion of the construction project is deemed probable, or expensed at\nthe time construction completion is determined to no longer be probable. The continued capitalization of such costs is subject to risks related to\nsuccessful completion, including those related to government approvals, site identification, financing, construction permitting and contract\ncompliance. Construction-in-progress balances are transferred to electric generation and distribution assets when an asset group is ready for its\nintended use.

The Company accounts for purchased emission\nallowances as intangible assets and records an expense when they are utilized or sold. Granted emission allowances are valued at zero.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets — When circumstances indicate the carrying amount of long-lived assets in a held-for-use asset group\nmay not be recoverable, the Company evaluates the assets for potential impairment using internal projections of undiscounted cash flows\nresulting from the use and eventual disposal of the assets. Events or changes in circumstances that may necessitate a recoverability evaluation\ninclude, but are not limited to, adverse changes in the regulatory environment, unfavorable changes in power prices or fuel costs, increased\ncompetition due to additional capacity in the grid, technological advancements, declining trends in demand, or an expectation it is more likely\nthan not that the asset will be disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life. If the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the\nundiscounted cash flows, an impairment expense is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair\nvalue (subject to the carrying amount not being reduced below fair value for any individual long-lived asset that is determinable without undue\ncost and effort). An impairment expense for certain assets may be reduced by the establishment of a regulatory asset if recovery through\napproved rates is probable.\nDEBT ISSUANCE COSTS — Costs incurred in connection with the issuance of long-term debt are deferred and presented as a direct\nreduction from the face amount of that debt and amortized over the related financing period using the effective interest method.

When a new liability is recognized, the Company capitalizes the costs of the liability by increasing the\ncarrying amount of the related long-lived asset. The liability is accreted to its present value each period and the capitalized cost is depreciated\nover the useful life of the related asset.

Since tariffs are determined\nby the regulator, the price that our utilities have the right to bill corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the utility's performance\ncompleted in each period. The Company also has some month-to-month contracts. Revenue under these contracts is recognized using an\noutput method measured by the MWh delivered each month, which best depicts the transfer of goods or services to the customer, at the\napproved tariff.\nThe Company has businesses where it sells and purchases power to and from ISOs and RTOs. Our utility businesses generally purchase\npower to satisfy the demand of customers that is not contracted through separate PPAs. In these instances, the Company accounts for these\ntransactions on a net hourly basis because the transactions are settled on a net hourly basis. In limited situations, a utility customer may choose\nto receive generation services from a third-party provider, in which case the Company may serve as a billing agent for the provider and\nrecognize revenue on a net basis.\nGeneration — Most of our generation fleet sells electricity under contracts to customers such as utilities, industrial users, and other\nintermediaries. Our generation contracts, based on specific facts and circumstances, can have one or more performance obligations as the\npromise to transfer energy, capacity, and other services may or may not be distinct depending on the nature of the market and terms of the\ncontract.\nFor contracts determined to have multiple performance obligations, we allocate revenue to each performance obligation based on its\nrelative standalone selling price using a market or expected cost plus margin approach.

Performance obligations to deliver energy are generally satisfied when the MW is generated.

Such bonuses or penalties represent a form of variable consideration and\nare estimated and recognized when it is probable that there will not be a significant reversal.\nCertain generation contracts contain operating and sales-type leases where capacity payments are generally considered lease elements. In\nsuch cases, the allocation between the lease and non-lease elements is made at the inception of the lease following the guidance in ASC 842.\nIn assessing whether variable quantities are considered variable consideration or an option to acquire additional goods and services, the\nCompany evaluates the nature of the promise and the legally enforceable rights in the contract. In some contracts, such as requirement\ncontracts, the legally enforceable rights merely give the customer a right to purchase additional goods and services which are distinct. In these\ncontracts, the customer's action results in a new obligation, and the variable quantities are considered an option.\nWhen energy or capacity is sold or purchased in the spot market or to ISOs, the Company assesses the facts and circumstances to\ndetermine gross versus net presentation of spot revenues and purchases. Generally, the nature of the performance obligation is to sell surplus\nenergy or capacity above contractual commitments, or to purchase energy or capacity to satisfy deficits. Generally, on an hourly basis, a\ngenerator is either a net seller or a net buyer in terms of the amount of energy or capacity transacted with the ISO.

We bill both generation and utilities\ncustomers on a contractually agreed-upon schedule, typically at periodic intervals (e.g., monthly).

This\nplant is operated under a build, operate, and transfer (“BOT”) contract and will be transferred to the Vietnamese government after the completion\nof a 25-year PPA. A loan receivable was recognized in 2018 upon the adoption of ASC 606 in order to account for the future expected payments\nfor the construction performance obligation portion of the BOT contract. As the payments for the construction performance obligation occur over\na 25-year term, a significant financing element was determined to exist which is accounted for under the effective interest rate method.\nHistorically, the Company has not incurred any losses on this arrangement, of which no directly comparable assets exist in the market. In order\nto determine expected credit losses under ASC 326 arising from this $1.4 billion loan receivable as of January 1, 2020, the Company considered\naverage historical default and recovery rates on similarly rated sovereign bonds, which formed an initial basis for developing a probability of\ndefault, net of expected recoveries, to be applied as a key credit quality indicator for this arrangement. A resulting estimated loss rate of 2.4%\nwas applied to the weighted-average remaining life of the loan receivable, after adjustments for certain asset-specific characteristics, including\nthe Company’s status as a large foreign direct investor in Vietnam, Mong Duong’s status as critical energy infrastructure in Vietnam, and cash\nflows from the operations of the plant, which are under the Company’s control until the end of the BOT contract. As a result of this analysis, the\nCompany recognized an opening CECL reserve of $34 million as an adjustment to Accumulated deficit and Noncontrolling interests as of\nJanuary 1, 2020.\nArgentina — Exposure to CAMMESA, the administrator of the wholesale energy market in Argentina, is the driver of credit reserves in\nArgentina.

The Company monitors these risks, including the credit ratings of the\nArgentine government, on a quarterly basis to assess the collectability of these receivables. Historically, the Company has not incurred any\ncredit-related losses on these receivables. In order to determine expected credit losses under ASC 326, the Company considered historical\ndefault probabilities utilizing similarly rated sovereign bonds and historic recovery rates for Argentine government bond defaults. This information\nformed an initial basis for developing a probability of default, net of expected recoveries, to be applied as a key credit quality indicator across the\nunderlying financing receivables. A resulting estimated weighted average loss rate of 41.2% was applied to the remaining balance of these\nreceivables, after adjustments for certain asset-specific characteristics, including AES Argentina’s role in providing critical energy infrastructure to\nArgentina, our history of collections on these receivables, and the average term that the receivables are expected to be outstanding. As a result\nof this analysis, the Company recognized an opening CECL reserve of $29 million as an adjustment to Accumulated deficit as of January 1,\n2020.\nOther financial assets — Application of ASC 326 to the Company’s $1.5 billion of trade accounts receivable and $326 million of available-\nfor-sale debt securities at January 1, 2020 did not result in any material adjustments, primarily due to the short-term duration and high turnover\nof these financial assets. Additionally, a large portion of our trade accounts receivables and amounts reserved for doubtful accounts under legacy\nGAAP arise from arrangements accounted for as an operating lease under ASC 842, which are excluded from the scope of ASC 326.\nAs discussed in Note 7—Financing Receivables, AES Andes recorded $33 million of noncurrent receivables at December 31, 2020\npertaining to revenues recognized on regulated energy contracts that were impacted by the Stabilization Fund created by the Chilean\ngovernment in October 2019. The Company expects to collect these noncurrent receivables through the execution of sale agreements with third\nparties.

The income approach uses valuation\ntechniques to convert future amounts to a single present value amount. The measurement is based on current market expectations of the return\non those future amounts. The cost approach is based on the amount that would currently be required to replace an asset. The Company\nmeasures its investments and derivatives at fair value on a recurring basis. Additionally, in connection with annual or event-driven impairment\nevaluations, certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These include long-lived tangible\nassets (i.e., property, plant and equipment), goodwill, and intangible assets (e.g., sales concessions, land use rights and water rights, etc.). In\ngeneral, the Company determines the fair value of investments and derivatives using the market approach and the income approach,\nrespectively. In the nonrecurring measurements of nonfinancial assets and liabilities, all three approaches are considered; however, the value\nestimated under the income approach is often the most representative of fair value.\nInvestments — The Company's investments measured at fair value generally consist of marketable debt and equity securities. Equity\nsecurities are either measured at fair value using quoted market prices or based on comparisons to market data obtained for similar assets. Debt\nsecurities primarily consist of unsecured debentures and certificates of deposit held by our Brazilian subsidiaries. Returns and pricing on these\ninstruments are generally indexed to the market interest rates in Brazil. Debt securities are measured at fair value based on comparisons to\nmarket data obtained for similar assets.\nDerivatives — Derivatives are measured at fair value using quoted market prices or the income approach utilizing volatilities, spot and\nforward benchmark interest rates (such as LIBOR, SOFR, and EURIBOR), foreign exchange rates, credit data, and commodity prices, as\napplicable. When significant inputs are not observable, the Company uses relevant techniques to determine the inputs, such as regression\nanalysis or prices for similarly traded instruments available in the market.\nThe Company's methodology to fair value its derivatives is to start with any observable inputs; however, in certain instances the published\nforward rates or prices may not extend through the remaining term of the contract, and management must make assumptions to extrapolate the\ncurve, which necessitates the use of unobservable inputs, such as proxy commodity prices or historical settlements to forecast forward prices.\nSpecifically, where there is limited forward curve data with respect to foreign exchange contracts beyond the traded points, the Company utilizes\nthe interest rate differential approach to construct the remaining portion of the forward curve.

The Company then\nmakes a credit valuation adjustment (\"CVA\"), as applicable, by further discounting the cash flows for nonperformance or credit risk based on the\nobservable or estimated debt spread of the Company's subsidiary or its counterparty and the tenor of the respective derivative instrument. The\nCVA for potential\n\n\n148 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020\nfuture scenarios in which the derivative is in an asset position is based on the counterparty's credit ratings, credit default swap spreads, and debt\nspreads, as available. The CVA for potential future scenarios in which the derivative is in a liability position is based on the Parent Company's or\nthe subsidiary's current debt spread. In the absence of readily obtainable credit information, the Parent Company's or the subsidiary's estimated\ncredit rating (based on applying a standard industry model to historical financial information and then considering other relevant information) and\nspreads of comparably rated entities or the respective country's debt spreads are used as a proxy. All derivative instruments are analyzed\nindividually and are subject to unique risk exposures.\nThe fair value hierarchy of an asset or a liability is based on the level of significance of the input assumptions. An input assumption is\nconsidered significant if it affects the fair value by at least 10%. Assets and liabilities are classified as Level 3 when the use of unobservable\ninputs is significant. When the use of unobservable inputs is insignificant, assets and liabilities are classified as Level 2. Transfers between Level\n3 and Level 2 result from changes in significance of unobservable inputs used to calculate the CVA.\nDebt — Recourse and non-recourse debt are carried at amortized cost. The fair value of recourse debt is estimated based on quoted\nmarket prices. The fair value of non-recourse debt is estimated based upon interest rates and other features of the loan. In general, the carrying\namount of variable rate debt is a close approximation of its fair value. For fixed rate loans, the fair value is estimated using quoted market prices\nor discounted cash flow (\"DCF\") analyses. The fair value of recourse and non-recourse debt excludes accrued interest at the valuation date. The\nfair value was determined using available market information as of December 31, 2022. The Company is not aware of any factors that would\nsignificantly affect the fair value amounts subsequent to December 31, 2022.\nNonrecurring measurements — For nonrecurring measurements derived using the income approach, fair value is generally determined\nusing valuation models based on the principles of DCF.

Where the use of market observable data is limited or not available\nfor certain input assumptions, the Company develops its own estimates using a variety of techniques such as regression analysis and\nextrapolations. Depending on the complexity of a valuation, an independent valuation firm may be engaged to assist management in the\nvaluation process.\nFor nonrecurring measurements derived using the market approach, recent market transactions involving the sale of identical or similar\nassets are considered. The use of this approach is limited because it is often difficult to identify sale transactions of identical or similar assets.\nThis approach is used in impairment evaluations of certain intangible assets. Otherwise, it is used to corroborate the fair value determined under\nthe income approach.\nFor nonrecurring measurements derived using the cost approach, fair value is typically based upon a replacement cost approach. This\napproach involves a considerable amount of judgment, which is why its use is limited to the measurement of long-lived tangible assets. Like the\nmarket approach, this approach is also used to corroborate the fair value determined under the income approach.\nFair Value Considerations — In determining fair value, the Company considers the source of observable market data inputs, liquidity of\nthe instrument, the credit risk of the counterparty, and the risk of the Company's or its counterparty's nonperformance. The conditions and criteria\nused to assess these factors are:\nSources of market assumptions — The Company derives most of its market assumptions from market efficient data sources\n(e.g., Bloomberg and Reuters). To determine fair value where market data is not readily available, management uses comparable market\nsources and empirical evidence to develop its own estimates of market assumptions.\nMarket liquidity — The Company evaluates market liquidity based on whether the financial or physical instrument, or the underlying asset,\nis traded in an active or inactive market. An active market exists if the prices are fully transparent to market participants, can be measured by\nmarket bid and ask quotes, the market has a relatively large proportion of trading volume as compared to the Company's current trading volume,\nand the market has a significant number of market participants that will allow the market to rapidly absorb the quantity of assets traded without\nsignificantly affecting the market price. Another factor the Company considers when determining whether a market is active or inactive is the\npresence of government or regulatory controls over pricing that could make it difficult to establish a market-based price when entering into a\ntransaction.\nNonperformance risk — Nonperformance risk refers to the risk that an obligation will not be fulfilled and affects the value at which a l",

The Tariff Stabilization Laws do not allow the pass-through of these contractual indexation updates to customers beyond the\npricing in effect at July 1, 2019, until new lower-cost renewable contracts are incorporated to supply regulated contracts. Consequently, costs\nincurred in excess of the July 1, 2019 price are accumulated and borne by generators. Through different programs, AES Andes aims to reduce\nits exposure and has already sold a significant portion of the receivables accumulated as of December 31, 2021.\nAs of December 31, 2022, $26 million of current receivables and $227 million of noncurrent receivables were recorded in Accounts\nreceivable and Other noncurrent assets, respectively, pertaining to the Stabilization Funds.

The Company monitors these risks, including the credit\nratings of the Argentine government, on a quarterly basis to assess the collectability of these receivables. The Company accrues interest on\nthese receivables once the recognition criteria have been met. The Company's collection estimates are based on assumptions that it believes to\nbe reasonable, but are inherently uncertain. Actual future cash flows could differ from these estimates.\nAs a result of energy market reforms in 2004 and 2010, AES Argentina entered into three agreements with the Argentine government,\nreferred to as the FONINVEMEM Agreements, to contribute a portion of their accounts receivable into a fund for financing the construction of\ncombined cycle and gas-fired plants. These receivables accrue interest and are collected in monthly installments over 10 years once the related\nplant begins operations.\nThe FONINVEMEM receivables are denominated in Argentine pesos, but indexed to USD, which represents a foreign currency derivative.\nDue to differences between spot rates, used to remeasure the receivables, and discounted forward rates, used to value the foreign currency\nderivative, these two items will not perfectly offset over the life of the receivable. Once settled, the foreign currency derivative will offset the\naccumulated unrealized foreign currency losses resulting from the devaluation of the FONINVEMEM receivable. As of December 31, 2022 and\n2021, the amount of the foreign currency-related derivative assets associated with the FONINVEMEM financing receivables that were excluded\nfrom the table above had a fair value of $64 million and $108 million, respectively.\nThe receivables under the FONINVEMEM Agreements have been actively collected since the related plants commenced operations in\n2010 and 2016. In assessing the collectability of the receivables under these agreements, the Company also considers historic collection\nevidence in accordance with the agreements.\n8.

The effects of actual results differing from the Company's assumptions are\naccumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect the Company's recognized expense in such future periods.\nUnrecognized gains or losses are amortized using the “corridor approach,” under which the net gain or loss in excess of 10% of the greater of\nthe projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of the assets, if applicable, is amortized.\nSensitivity of the Company's pension funded status to the indicated increase or decrease in the discount rate and long-term rate of return\non plan assets assumptions is shown below. Note that these sensitivities may be asymmetric and are specific to the base conditions at year-end\n2022. They also may not be additive, so the impact of changing multiple factors simultaneously cannot be calculated by combining the individual\nsensitivities shown. The funded status as of December 31, 2022 is affected by the assumptions as of that date. Pension expense for 2022 is\naffected by the December 31, 2021 assumptions.

As a result, the minority ownership interest is considered temporary equity.\nIn 2022, AES Clean Energy Development, through multiple transactions, sold noncontrolling interests in multiple project companies to\ntax equity partners, resulting in a $157 million increase to Redeemable stock of subsidiaries.

RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES\nAES is a diversified power generation and utility company organized into four market-oriented SBUs. See additional discussion of the\nCompany's principal markets in Note 18—Segments and Geographic Information. Within our four SBUs, we have two primary lines of business:\ngeneration and utilities. The generation line of business uses a wide range of fuels and technologies to generate electricity such as coal, gas,\nhydro, wind, solar, and biomass. Our utilities business comprises businesses that transmit, distribute, and in certain circumstances, generate\npower. In addition, the Company has operations in the renewables area. These efforts include projects primarily in wind, solar, and energy\nstorage.\nOperating and Economic Risks — The Company operates in several developing economies where macroeconomic conditions are\ntypically more volatile than developed economies. Deteriorating market conditions and evolving industry expectations to transition away from\nfossil fuel sources for generation expose the Company to the risk of decreased earnings and cash flows due to, among other factors, adverse\nfluctuations in the commodities and foreign currency spot markets, and potential changes in the estimated useful lives of our thermal plants.\nAdditionally, credit markets around the globe continue to tighten their standards, which could impact our ability to finance growth projects through\naccess to capital markets. Currently, the Company has an investment grade rating from both Standard & Poor's and Fitch of BBB- and an\ninvestment grade rating from Moody's of Baa3. A downgrade in our current investment grade ratings could affect the Company's ability to finance\nnew and/or existing development projects at competitive interest rates. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had $1.4 billion of unrestricted\ncash and cash equivalents.\n\n\n195 | Notes",

We continue to invest in several developing countries to expand our existing platform and operations. International\noperations, particularly the operation, financing, and development of projects in developing countries, entail significant risks and uncertainties,\nincluding, without limitation:\n•\neconomic, social, and political instability in any particular country or region;\n•\ninability to economically hedge energy prices;\n•\nvolatility in commodity prices;\n•\nadverse changes in currency exchange rates;\n•\ngovernment restrictions on converting currencies or repatriating funds;\n•\nunexpected changes in foreign laws, regulatory framework, or in trade, monetary or fiscal policies;\n•\nhigh inflation and monetary fluctuations;\n•\nrestrictions on imports of solar panels, wind turbines, coal, oil, gas, or other raw materials required by our generation businesses to\noperate;\n•\nthreatened or consummated expropriation or nationalization of our assets by foreign governments;\n•\nunwillingness of governments, government agencies, similar organizations, or other counterparties to honor their commitments;\n•\nunwillingness of governments, government agencies, courts, or similar bodies to enforce contracts that are economically advantageous\nto subsidiaries of the Company and economically unfavorable to counterparties, against such counterparties, whether such\ncounterparties are governments or private parties;\n•\ninability to obtain access to fair and equitable political, regulatory, administrative, and legal systems;\n•\nadverse changes in government tax policy;\n•\npotentially adverse tax consequences of operating in multiple jurisdictions;\n•\ndifficulties in enforcing our contractual rights, enforcing judgments, or obtaining a just result in local jurisdictions; and\n•\ninability to obtain financing on expected terms.\nAny of these factors, individually or in combination with others, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and\nfinancial condition. In addition, our Latin American operations experience volatility in revenue and earnings which have caused and are expected\nto cause significant volatility in our results of operations and cash flows. The volatility is caused by regulatory and economic difficulties, political\ninstability, indexation of certain PPAs to fuel prices, and currency fluctuations being experienced in many of these countries. This volatility\nreduces the predictability and enhances the uncertainty associated with cash flows from these businesses.\nOur inability to predict, influence or respond appropriately to changes in law or regulatory schemes, including any inability to obtain\nreasonable increases in tariffs or tariff adjustments for increased expenses, could adve",

Under some of these scenarios, Alto Maipo may experience reduced future cash flows, which would limit its ability to repay debt. Alto\nMaipo’s management initiated negotiations with its creditors to restructure its obligations and achieve a sustainable long-term capital structure\nfor Alto Maipo. On November 17, 2021, Alto Maipo SpA commenced a reorganization proceeding in accordance with Chapter 11 of the U.S.\nBankruptcy Code, through a voluntary petition. Consequently, after the Chapter 11 filing, the Company is no longer considered to have control\nover Alto Maipo, which resulted in its deconsolidation. The Company recognized an after-tax loss of approximately $1.2 billion, net of\nnoncontrolling interests, in the Consolidated Statement of Operations in the fourth quarter of 2021, associated with the loss of control attributable\nto the former controlling interest.\nOn May 26, 2022, Alto Maipo emerged from bankruptcy in accordance with Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

If Alto Maipo is unable to meet its obligations under the restructured arrangements as they come due, the creditors\nmay enforce their rights under the credit agreements. These finance agreements are non-recourse with respect to The AES Corporation.\nForeign Currency Risks — AES operates businesses in many foreign countries and such operations could be impacted by significant\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Fluctuations in currency exchange rate between the USD and the following currencies could\ncreate significant fluctuations in earnings and cash flows: the Argentine peso, the Brazilian real, the Chilean peso, the Colombian peso, the\nDominican peso, the Euro, the Indian rupee, and the Mexican peso.\nConcentrations — Due to the geographical diversity of its operations, the Company does not have any significant concentration of\ncustomers or sources of fuel supply. Several of the Company's generation businesses rely on PPAs with one or a limited number of customers\nfor the majority of, and in some cases all of, the relevant businesses' output over the term of the PPAs. However, no single customer accounted\nfor 10% or more of total revenue in 2022, 2021 or 2020.\nThe cash flows and results of operations of our businesses depend on the credit quality of our customers and the continued ability of our\ncustomers and suppliers to meet their obligations under PPAs and fuel supply agreements.

In the ordinary course of business, these businesses enter into energy purchase and sale transactions, and transmission\nagreements with other state-owned institutions which are controlled by such governments. At two of our generation businesses in Mexico, the\nofftakers exercise significant influence, but not control, through representation on these businesses' Boards of Directors. These offtakers are\nalso required to hold a nominal ownership interest in such businesses. Furthermore, in 2021, the Company began construction projects with\nFluence relating to energy storage.

The Company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable\nassurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with\nGAAP and includes those policies and procedures that:\n•\npertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the\nassets of the Company;\n•\nprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance\nwith GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management\nand directors of the Company; and\n•\nprovide reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect\non the financial statements are prevented or detected timely.\nManagement, including our CEO and CFO, does not expect that our internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control\nsystem, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control\nsystem are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must\nbe considered relative to their costs. In addition, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls is subject to risks that those internal controls may\nbecome inadequate in future periods because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or\nprocedures deteriorates.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this\nassessment, management used the criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission (\"COSO\") in 2013. Based on this assessment, management believes that the Company maintained\neffective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022.\nThe effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, has been audited by Ernst &\nYoung LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which appears herein.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting:\nThere were no changes that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely\nto materially affect, our internal ",

      "output": "We have gathered information on AES's FY2022 net income and total assets for FY2021 and FY2022. \n\n1. **Net Income for FY2022**: There are multiple outputs, but the most consistent and frequently cited figure is a net loss of \\(-\\$546\\) million. This figure is supported by several citations, indicating it is likely the correct value.\n\n2. **Total Assets for FY2021 and FY2022**: The most consistent figures for total assets are:\n   - FY2021: \\$32,963 million\n   - FY2022: \\$38,363 million\n   These values are supported by multiple citations and appear to be the most reliable.\n\n3. **Sufficiency of Information**: We have sufficient information to calculate the ROA. We have the net income for FY2022 and the total assets for both FY2021 and FY2022.\n\n4. **Calculation of ROA**:\n   - First, calculate the average total assets: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Average Total Assets} = \\frac{\\$32,963 + \\$38,363}{2} = \\$35,663 \\text{ million}\n     \\]\n   - Then, calculate the ROA using the formula:\n     \\[\n     \\text{ROA} = \\frac{-\\$546 \\text{ million}}{\\$35,663 \\text{ million}} \\approx -0.0153\n     \\]\n   - Round to two decimal places: \n     \\[\n     \\text{ROA} \\approx -1.53\\%\n     \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The ROA for AES in FY2022 is approximately \\(-1.53\\%\\). The information gathered is consistent and sufficient to answer the question."
