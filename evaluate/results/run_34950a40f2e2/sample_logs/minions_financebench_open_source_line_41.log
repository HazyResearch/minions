--- Question ---
Does AMEX have an improving operating margin profile as of 2022? If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
AMEX's operating margin for 2022 shows a range of values, with the most frequent being around 18.1% to 19.6%. There is no clear evidence of an improving trend, and the document does not discuss the relevance of operating margin as a primary metric for AMEX. Therefore, while operating margin is calculated, it may not be the most useful metric for evaluating AMEX's financial performance.

--- Ground Truth ---
['Performance is not measured through operating margin']
