      "output": "To answer the question about the FY2017 - FY2019 3-year average of capex as a percentage of revenue for Activision Blizzard, focus on extracting specific financial data from the document. You need to locate the statement of income and the cash flow statement for each fiscal year from 2017 to 2019. From the statement of income, identify the total revenue figures for each year. From the cash flow statement, find the capital expenditures (capex) for the same years. Calculate the capex as a percentage of revenue for each year by dividing the capex by the revenue and multiplying by 100. Finally, compute the average of these percentages over the three years and round the result to one decimal place. This will provide the required 3-year average capex as a percentage of revenue."

Instead, you can assign small, isolated tasks to a less capable worker model that sees only a single chunk of text at a time. Any cross-chunk or multi-document reasoning must be handled by you.\n\n## Your Job: Write Two Python Functions\n\n### FUNCTION #1: `prepare_jobs(context, prev_job_manifests, prev_job_outputs) -> List[JobManifest]`\n- Break the document(s) into chunks (using the provided chunking function, if needed). Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 12 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`. All **multi-chunk integration** or **global reasoning** is your responsibility here.\n- Return one **aggregated string** suitable for further supervisor inspection.\n\n\n\n## Relevant Pydantic Models\n\nThe following models are already in the global scope. **Do NOT redefine or re-import them.**\n\n### JobManifest Model\n```\nclass JobManifest(BaseModel):\n    chunk: str  # the actual text for the chunk of the document\n    task: str  # the actual task instruction for the small model\n    advice: str  # optional, any additional advice on how to perform the task\n\n    chunk_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    task_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    job_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n\n```\n\n### JobOutput Model\n```\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    citation: Optional[str]\n    answer: Optional[str]\n\n```\n\n## Function Signatures\n```\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        context (List[str]): A list of documents.

We endeavor to reach as many consumers as possible either through: (1) the purchase of our content and services; (2) engagement in our free-to-play games,\nwhich allow consumers to play games with no up-front cost but provide for player investment through sales of downloadable content or via microtransactions; or (3)\nengagement in other types of media based on our franchises, such as esports.\nDriving deep consumer engagement. Our high-quality entertainment content not only expands our audience reach, but it also drives deep engagement with our\nfranchises. We design our games, as well as related media, to provide a depth of content that keeps consumers engaged for a long period of time following a game’s\nrelease, delivering more value to our players and additional growth opportunities for our franchises.\nProviding more opportunities for player investment. Increasingly, our consumers are connected to our games online through consoles, PCs, and mobile devices.\nThis allows us to offer additional digital player investment opportunities directly to our consumers on a year-round basis. In addition to purchasing full games or\nsubscriptions, players can invest in certain of our games and franchises by purchasing incremental “in-game” content (including larger downloadable content or smaller\ncontent, via microtransactions). These digital revenue streams tend to be more recurring and have relatively higher profit margins. Further, if executed properly,\nadditional player investment can increase engagement as it provides more frequent and incremental content for our players. In addition, we generate revenue through\noffering advertising within certain of our franchises, and we believe there are opportunities to grow new forms of player investment through esports and consumer\nproducts. We are still in the early stages of developing these new revenue streams.\nReportable Segments\nBased upon our organizational structure, we conduct our business through three reportable segments as follows:\n(i) Activision Publishing, Inc.\nActivision Publishing, Inc. (“Activision”) is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive software products and entertainment content, particularly for\nthe console platform.

Further, competitors may develop content that imitates or competes with our best‑selling games, potentially reducing our\nsales or our ability to charge the same prices we have historically charged for our products. These competing products may take a larger share of consumer spending\nthan anticipated, which could cause product sales to fall below expectations. If we do not continue to develop consistently high‑quality and well‑received games or\nenhancements to those games, if our marketing fails to resonate with our consumers, or if consumers lose interest in a genre of games we produce, our revenues and\nprofit margins could decline. In addition, our own best‑selling products could compete with our other games, reducing sales for those other games. Further, a failure by\nus to develop a high‑quality product, or our development of a product that is otherwise not well‑received, could potentially result in additional expenditures to respond\nto consumer demands, harm our reputation, and increase the likelihood that our future products will not be well‑received. The increased importance of downloadable\ncontent to our business amplifies these risks, as downloadable content for poorly‑received games typically generates lower‑than‑expected sales. The increased demand\nfor consistent enhancement to our products also requires a greater allocation of financial resources to those products.\nAdditionally, consumer expectations regarding the quality, performance and integrity of our products and services are high. Consumers may be critical of our\nbrands, games, services, and/or business practices for a wide variety of reasons, and such negative reactions may not be foreseeable or within our control to manage\neffectively. For example, if our games or services, such as our proprietary online gaming service, do not function as consumers expect, whether because they fail to\nfunction as advertised or otherwise, our sales may suffer. The risk that this may occur is particularly pronounced with respect to our games with online features because\nthey involve ongoing consumer expectations, which we may not be able to consistently satisfy. Our games with online features are also frequently updated, increasing\nthe risk that a game may contain significant errors, or “bugs.” If any of these issues occur, consumers may stop playing the game and may be less likely to return to the\ngame as often in the future, which may negatively impact our business.\nFurther, delays in product releases or disruptions following the commercial release of one or more new products could negatively impact our business and\nreputation and could cause our results of operations to be materially different from expectations.

The increased importance\nof digital channels in our industry increases our potential competition, as the minimum capital needed to produce and publish a digitally delivered game, particularly a\ngame for a mobile platform, may be significantly less than that needed to produce and publish one that is purchased through retail distribution and is played on a game\nconsole or PC. Also, while digitally-distributed products generally have higher profit margins than retail sales, as business shifts to digital distribution, the volume of\norders from retailers for physical discs has been, and may continue to be, reduced. Further, some of the providers of the platforms through which we digitally distribute\ncontent are also publishers of their own content distributed on those platforms, and, therefore, a platform provider may give priority to its own products or those of our\ncompetitors.\nThe importance of retail sales to our business exposes us to the risks of that business model.\nWhile the proportion of our revenues derived from digital distribution channels, as compared to traditional retail sales, continues to increase, retail sales remain\nimportant to our business.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nBusiness Overview\nActivision Blizzard, Inc. is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive entertainment content and services. We develop and distribute content and\nservices on video game consoles, personal computers (“PC”s), and mobile devices. We also operate esports leagues and offer digital advertising within our content. The\nterms “Activision Blizzard,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” are used to refer collectively to Activision Blizzard, Inc. and its subsidiaries.\nReportable Segments\nBased upon our organizational structure, we conduct our business through three reportable segments: Activision, Blizzard, and King.\n(i) Activision\nActivision is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive software products and entertainment content, particularly for the console platform. Activision\nprimarily delivers content through retail and digital channels, including full-game and in-game sales, as well as by licensing software to third-party or related-party\ncompanies that distribute Activision products. Activision develops, markets, and sells products primarily based on our internally developed intellectual properties.\nActivision also includes the activities of the Call of Duty League, a global professional esports league with city-based teams for Call of Duty.\n(ii) Blizzard\nBlizzard is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive software products and entertainment content, particularly for the PC platform. Blizzard\nprimarily delivers content through retail and digital channels, including subscriptions, full-game, and in-game sales, as well as by licensing software to third-party or\nrelated-party companies that distribute Blizzard products. Blizzard also maintains a proprietary online gaming service, Blizzard Battle.net, which facilitates digital\ndistribution of Blizzard content and selected Activision content, online social connectivity, and the creation of user-generated content. Blizzard also includes the\nactivities of the Overwatch League, the first major global professional esports league with city-based teams.\n(iii) King\nKing is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive entertainment content and services, particularly for the mobile platform, including for Google’s\nAndroid and Apple’s iOS.

Effective December 31, 2018, Activision and\nBungie mutually agreed to terminate their publishing relationship related to the Destiny franchise. As part of this termination, Activision agreed to transfer its\npublishing rights for the Destiny franchise to Bungie in exchange for cash and Bungie’s assumption of on-going customer obligations of Activision. As a result of the\nagreement to terminate the relationship, the Company recognized net bookings, a key operating metric, of $20 million, GAAP revenues of $164 million, and GAAP\noperating income of $91 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Activision no longer has any material rights or obligations related to the Destiny franchise.\n31\n\n\nTable of Contents\nBusiness Results and Highlights\nFinancial Results\n2019 financial highlights included:\n•\nconsolidated net revenues decreased 13% to $6.5 billion and consolidated operating income decreased 19% to $1.6 billion, as compared to consolidated\nnet revenues of $7.5 billion and consolidated operating income of $2.0 billion in 2018;\n•\nrevenues from digital online channels decreased 15% to $4.9 billion and were 76% of consolidated net revenues, as compared to $5.8 billion and 77% of\nconsolidated net revenues in 2018;\n•\noperating margin was 24.8%, as compared to 26.5% in 2018;\n•\nconsolidated net income decreased to $1.5 billion, as compared to $1.8 billion in 2018, which included significant discrete tax-related impacts in both\n2019 and 2018—refer to “Consolidated Results, Income Tax Expense” discussion below for details;\n•\ndiluted earnings per common share decreased to $1.95, as compared to $2.40 in 2018; and\n \n•\ncash flows from operating activities were approximately $1.83 billion, an increase of 2%, as compared to $1.79 billion in 2018.\nSince certain of our games are hosted online or include significant online functionality that represents a separate performance obligation, we defer the transaction\nprice allocable to the online functionality from the sale of these games and recognize the attributable revenues over the relevant estimated service periods, which are\ngenerally less than a year.

Revenue recognized at a “point-in-time” is primarily comprised of the portion of revenue from\nsoftware products that is recognized when the customer takes control of the product (i.e., upon delivery of the software product) and revenues from our Distribution\nbusiness. “Over-time and other revenue” is primarily comprised of revenue associated with the online functionality of our games, in-game purchases, and subscriptions.\nContent Release and Event Highlights\nGames and downloadable content that were released during 2019, include:\n•\nActivision’s Sekiro\nTM: Shadows Die Twice;\n•\nActivision’s Crash\nTM Team Racing Nitro-Fueled;\n•\nActivision’s Spyro® Reignited Trilogy on Nintendo Switch and PC;\n•\nActivision’s Call of Duty: Mobile;\n•\nActivision’s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare;\n•\nBlizzard’s World of Warcraft® Classic; and\n•\nBlizzard’s latest expansions to Hearthstone—Rise of Shadows\nTM, Saviors of Uldum\nTM, Tombs of Terror\nTM,, and Descent of Dragons\nTM.\n32\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe Overwatch League, the first major global professional esports league with city-based teams, completed its second season in 2019 and began its third season\nin February 2020. During 2019, we also sold the first 12 teams for the Call of Duty League, which began its first season in January 2020.\nInternational Sales\nInternational sales are a fundamental part of our business. An important element of our international strategy is to develop content that is specifically directed\ntoward local cultures and customs. Net revenues from international sales accounted for approximately 54%, 54%, and 55% of our total consolidated net revenues for\nthe years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The majority of our net revenues from foreign countries are generated by consumers in Australia,\nBrazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Our international business is subject to\nrisks typical of an international business, including, but not limited to, foreign currency exchange rate volatility and changes in local economies. Accordingly, our\nfuture results could be materially and adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in local economies.\nOperating Metrics\nThe following operating metrics are key performance indicators that we use to evaluate our business. The key drivers of changes in our operating metrics are\npresented in the order of significance.\nNet bookings and In-game net bookings\nWe monitor net bookings as a key operating metric in evaluating the performance of our business because it enables an analysis of performance based on the\ntiming of actual transactions with our customers and provides more timely indic",

We calculate average MAUs in a period by adding the total number of MAUs in each of the months in a given period and dividing that total by\nthe number of months in the period. An individual who accesses two of our games would be counted as two users. In addition, due to technical limitations, for\nActivision and King, an individual who accesses the same game on two platforms or devices in the relevant period would be counted as two users. For Blizzard, an\nindividual who accesses the same game on two platforms or devices in the relevant period would generally be counted as a single user. In certain instances, we rely on\nthird parties to publish our games. In these instances, MAU data is based on information provided to us by those third parties, or, if final data is not available,\nreasonable estimates of MAUs for these third-party published games.\nThe number of MAUs for a given period can be significantly impacted by the timing of new content releases, since new releases may cause a temporary surge in\nMAUs. Accordingly, although we believe that overall trending in the number of MAUs can be a meaningful performance metric, period-to-period fluctuations may not\nbe indicative of longer-term trends.

The\nyear-over-year increase in average MAUs is due to higher average MAUs for Activision, primarily driven by the launch Call of Duty: Mobile, partially offset by the\nabsence of Destiny MAUs in our operating metric.

          "chunk": "13% annually from 2016 to 2019. The industry continues to benefit from additional players entering the market as interactive\nentertainment becomes more commonplace across age groups and as more developing regions gain access to this form of entertainment.\nFurther, wide adoption of smartphones globally and the free-to-play business model on those platforms has increased the total addressable audience for gaming\nsignificantly by introducing gaming to new age groups and new regions and allowing gaming to occur more widely outside the home. Mobile gaming is estimated to be\nlarger than console and PC gaming, and continues to grow at a significant rate. King is a leading developer of mobile and free-to-play games, and our other business\nunits have mobile efforts underway that present the opportunity for us to expand the reach of, and drive additional player investment in our franchises. The October\n2019 launch of Call of Duty: Mobile is an example of these efforts.\nOpportunities to Expand Franchises Outside of Games\nOur fans spend significant time engaging in our franchises and investing through purchases of our game content, including full games, downloadable content and\nmicrotransactions. Given the passion our players have for our franchises, we believe there are emerging opportunities to drive additional engagement and investment in\nour franchises outside of games. Our efforts to build these adjacent opportunities are still relatively nascent, but we view them as potentially significant sources of\nfuture revenues.\nFor example, as part of our efforts to take advantage of esports opportunities, we have sold rights for 20 teams that are participating in the Overwatch League,\nwhich recently began its third season in February 2020, and, during 2019, we sold rights for the first 12 teams for the Call of Duty League, which began its first season\nin January 2020.\nConcentration of Sales Among the Most Popular Franchises\nThe concentration of retail revenues among key titles has continued as a trend in the overall interactive entertainment industry. According to The NPD Group, the\ntop 10 titles accounted for 33% of the retail sales in the U.S. interactive entertainment industry in 2019. Similarly, a significant portion of our revenues historically has\nbeen derived from video games based on a few popular franchises, and these video games have also been responsible for a disproportionately high percentage of our\nprofits. For example, in 2019, the Call of Duty, Candy Crush, and World of Warcraft franchises, collectively, accounted for 67% of our consolidated net revenues—and\na significantly higher percentage of our operating income.\nThe top titles in the industry are also becoming more consistent as players and revenues concentrate more heavily in established franchises. Of the top 10 console\nfranchises in the U.S. in 2019, all 10 are from established franchises. Similarly, according to U.S rankings for the Apple App Store and Google Play Store per App\nAnnie Inte",

Further, while there is no guarantee of success, we invest in new properties in an effort to develop future top\nfranchises. For example, in 2014, we released Hearthstone, and in 2016, we released Overwatch. Additionally, to diversify our portfolio of key franchises and increase\nour presence on the mobile platform, in 2016, we acquired King. We also have been focusing on expanding our franchises to the mobile platform, as demonstrated by\nthe recently released Call of Duty: Mobile, as well as our plans for Diablo Immortal\nTM , which is currently in development.\nOverall, we do expect that a limited number of popular franchises will continue to produce a disproportionately high percentage of our, and the industry’s,\nrevenues and profits in the near future. Accordingly, our ability to maintain our top franchises and our ability to successfully compete against our competitors’ top\nfranchises can significantly impact our performance.\nRecurring Revenue Business Models and Seasonality\nIncreased consumer online connectivity has allowed us to offer players new investment opportunities and to shift our business further towards a more consistently\nrecurring and year-round model. Offering downloadable content and microtransactions, in addition to full games, allows our players to access and invest in new content\nthroughout the year. This incremental content not only provides additional high-margin revenues, it can also increase player engagement. Also, mobile games, and free-\nto-play games more broadly, are generally less seasonal than premium games developed primarily for the console or PC platforms.\nWhile our business is shifting toward a year-round engagement model, the interactive entertainment industry remains somewhat seasonal. We have historically\nexperienced our highest sales volume, particularly for Activision, in the calendar year-end holiday buying season.\nOutlook\nIn the second half of 2020, we plan to release the next premium title in our Call of Duty franchise and the next expansion for World of Warcraft, World of\nWarcraft: Shadowlands. In addition, throughout the year we expect to deliver ongoing content for our various franchises, including continued in-game content for Call\nof Duty: Modern Warfare and Call of Duty: Mobile, expansion packs and content updates for Hearthstone, in-game events for Overwatch, and continued releases of\ncontent, features, and services across King’s portfolio with an ongoing focus on the Candy Crush franchise.

Our full year 2019 effective tax rate of 8%\nis lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 21% primarily due to one-time tax benefits related to the intra-entity transfer of certain intellectual property rights, as further\ndescribed below, and earnings taxed at relatively lower rates in foreign jurisdictions, partially offset by changes in the Company's liability for uncertain tax positions\nand audit settlements.\nThe effective tax rate in 2019 was higher than in 2018, primarily due to one-time tax benefits reported in the prior year related to the U.S. Tax Reform Act and an\nIRS audit settlement. This increase was partially offset by one-time tax benefits reported in the current year related to the intra-entity transfer of certain intellectual\nproperty rights, net of changes in the Company’s liability for uncertain tax positions in the current year.\nThe overall effective income tax rate in future periods will depend on a variety of factors, such as changes in pre-tax income or loss by jurisdiction, applicable\naccounting rules, applicable tax laws and regulations, and rulings and interpretations thereof, developments in tax audits and other matters, and variations in the\nestimated and actual level of annual pre-tax income or loss.\nIntellectual Property Right Transfer\nIn October 2019, we completed an intra-entity transfer of certain intellectual property rights to one of our subsidiaries in the U.K., aligning the ownership of these\nrights with our evolving business. The transfer did not result in a taxable gain; however, our U.K. subsidiary received a step-up in tax basis based on the fair value of\nthe transferred intellectual property rights.

The primary adjustments related to the Closing Agreement were recognized in the second quarter of 2018\nand consisted of a tax expense of $70 million and a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits of $437 million. In addition, we recognized $185 million of tax benefits\nrelated to other tax adjustments resulting from the changes in U.S. tax attributes and taxable income caused by the primary adjustments.

The U.S. Tax Reform Act, among other things, reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from\n35% to 21% beginning in 2018 and implemented a modified territorial tax system that imposed a one-time tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries\n(the “Transition Tax”).

For the year ended December 31, 2018, we\nrecorded a net tax benefit of $340 million for the effects of the U.S. Tax Reform Act.

The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed throughout Management’s\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results. The policies,\nestimates, and assumptions discussed below are considered by management to be critical because they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and\nresults of operations and because their application places the most significant demands on management’s judgment, with financial reporting results relying on estimates\nand assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.

Revenues related to online hosted software arrangements are generally recognized ratably over the estimated service period.\nSubscription, Licensing, and Other Revenues\nSubscription Arrangements\nSubscription revenue arrangements are mostly derived from World of Warcraft, which is playable through Blizzard’s servers and is generally sold on a\nsubscription-only basis. Revenues associated with the sales of subscriptions are deferred until the subscription service is activated by the consumer and are then\nrecognized ratably over the subscription period as the performance obligations are satisfied.\nRevenues attributable to the purchase of World of Warcraft software by our customers, including expansion packs, are classified as “Product sales,” whereas\nrevenues attributable to subscriptions and other in-game revenues are classified as “Subscription, licensing, and other revenues.”\nSoftware Licensing Revenues\nIn certain countries, we utilize third-party licensees to distribute and host our games in accordance with license agreements, for which the licensees typically pay\nus a fixed minimum guarantee and sales-based royalties.

To estimate the standalone selling price we\ngenerally consider market data, including our pricing strategies for the product being evaluated and other similar products we may offer, competitor pricing to the\nextent data is available, and the replayability design of both the offline and online components of our games. In limited instances, we may also utilize an expected cost\napproach to determine whether the estimated selling price yields an appropriate profit margin.\nEstimated Service Period\nWe consider a variety of data points when determining the estimated service period for players of our games, including the weighted average number of days\nbetween players’ first and last days played online, the average total hours played, the average number of days in which player activity stabilizes, and the weighted-\naverage number of days between players’ first purchase date and last date played online.

The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities due to a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that\nincludes the enactment date. We evaluate deferred tax assets each period for recoverability.

In the event that all or part of the net\ndeferred tax assets are determined not to be realizable in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to tax expense in the period such\ndetermination is made. The calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of ASC Topic 740 and\ncomplex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on our business and results\nof operations in an interim period in which the uncertainties are ultimately resolved.\nSignificant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes.

Material differences may result in the amount and timing of expenses for any period if\nmatters resolve in a manner that is inconsistent with management’s expectations.\nFair Value Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements often requires us to determine the fair value of a particular item to fairly present in our consolidated financial statements.\nWithout an independent market or another representative transaction, determining the fair value of a particular item requires us to make several assumptions that are\ninherently difficult to predict and can have a material impact on the conclusion of the appropriate accounting.\n58\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThere are various valuation techniques used to estimate fair value. These include: (1) the market approach, where market transactions for identical or comparable\nassets or liabilities are used to determine the fair value; (2) the income approach, which uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts (for example, future cash\nflows or future earnings) to a single present amount; and (3) the cost approach, which is based on the amount that would be required to replace an asset. For many of\nour fair value estimates, we use the income approach. Using the income approach requires the use of financial models, which require us to make various estimates\nincluding, but not limited to: (1) the potential future cash flows for the asset, liability or equity instrument being measured; (2) the timing of receipt or payment of those\nfuture cash flows; (3) the time value of money associated with the delayed receipt or payment of such cash flows; and (4) the inherent risk associated with the cash\nflows (that is, the risk premium). Determining these cash flow estimates is inherently difficult and subjective, and, if any of the estimates used to determine the fair\nvalue using the income approach turns out to be inaccurate, our financial results may be negatively impacted. Furthermore, relatively small changes in many of these\nestimates can have a significant impact on the estimated fair value resulting from the financial models or the related accounting conclusion reached. For example, a\nrelatively small change in the estimated fair value of an asset may change a conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired. While we are required to make certain fair\nvalue assessments associated with the accounting for several types of transactions, the following areas are the most sensitive to the assessments:\nAssessment of Impairment of Goodwill and Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets\nWe are required to test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and, if current events or circumstances require, on\nan interim basis.

The second step (if necessary) measures the amount\nof impairment by applying fair value-based tests to the individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit. We perform our annual impairment test as of\nDecember 31.\nIn the instances when a quantitative test is performed, we use a discounted cash flow approach to determine the fair values of the reporting units in performing\nthe first step. Each step requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include long-\nterm growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates based on our weighted average cost of capital, and\nfuture economic and market conditions. These estimates and assumptions must be made for each reporting unit evaluated for impairment. Our estimates for market\ngrowth, our market share and costs are based on historical data, various internal estimates and certain external sources, as well as on assumptions that are consistent\nwith the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nMarket risk is the potential loss arising from fluctuations in market rates and prices. Our market risk exposures primarily include fluctuations in foreign currency\nexchange rates and interest rates.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nWe transact business in many different foreign currencies and may be exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange\nrates. Revenues and related expenses generated from our international operations are generally denominated in their respective local currencies. Primary currencies\ninclude euros, British pounds, Australian dollars, South Korean won, Chinese yuan, and Swedish krona. To the extent the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign\ncurrencies, the translation of these foreign currency-denominated transactions will result in reduced revenues, operating expenses, net income, and cash flows from our\ninternational operations. Similarly, our revenues, operating expenses, net income, and cash flows will increase for our international operations if the U.S. dollar\nweakens against foreign currencies. Since we have significant international sales, but incur the majority of our costs in the United States, the impact of foreign currency\nfluctuations, particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, may have an asymmetric and disproportional impact on our business. We monitor currency volatility\nthroughout the year.\nTo mitigate our foreign currency risk resulting from our foreign currency-denominated monetary assets, liabilities, and earnings and our foreign currency risk\nrelated to functional currency-equivalent cash flows resulting from our intercompany transactions, we periodically enter into currency derivative contracts, principally\nforward contracts. These forward contracts generally have a maturity of less than one year. The counterparties for our currency derivative contracts are large and\nreputable commercial or investment banks.\nThe fair values of our foreign currency contracts are estimated based on the prevailing exchange rates of the various hedged currencies as of the end of the period.\nWe do not hold or purchase any foreign currency forward contracts for trading or speculative purposes.\nFor a detailed discussion of our accounting policies for our foreign currency forward contracts, see Note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements\nincluded in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nForeign Currency Forward Contracts Designated as Hedges (“Cash Flow Hedges”)\nThe total gross notional amounts and fair values of our Cash Flow Hedges are as follows (amounts in millions):\n \nAs of December 31, 2019\n \nAs of December 31, 2018\n \nNotional amount\nFair value gain (loss)\n \nNotional amount\nFair value gain (loss)\nForeign Currency:\n \n \n \n \n \nBuy USD, Sell Euro\n$\n350\n$\n(2",

This sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel adverse shift of all foreign currency\nexchange rates against the U.S. dollar; however, all foreign currency exchange rates do not always move in this manner and actual results may differ materially.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio, as our outstanding debt is all at fixed rates. Our\ninvestment portfolio consists primarily of money market funds and government securities with high credit quality and short average maturities. Because short-term\nsecurities mature relatively quickly and must be reinvested at the then-current market rates, interest income on a portfolio consisting of cash, cash equivalents, or short-\nterm securities is more subject to market fluctuations than a portfolio of longer-term securities. Conversely, the fair value of such a portfolio is less sensitive to market\nfluctuations than a portfolio of longer-term securities. At December 31, 2019, our $5.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents was comprised primarily of money market\nfunds.\nThe Company has determined that, based on the composition of our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2019, there was no material interest rate risk\n",

A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable\nassurance that it will detect or uncover failures within the Company to disclose material information otherwise required to be set forth in our periodic reports. Inherent\nlimitations to any system of disclosure controls and procedures include, but are not limited to, the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of\nsuch controls by one or more persons. In addition, we have designed our system of controls based on certain assumptions, which we believe are reasonable, about the\nlikelihood of future events, and our system of controls may therefore not achieve its desired objectives under all possible future events.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.\nOur management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls\nand procedures at December 31, 2019, the end of the period covered by this report.

A company’s internal control over financial\nreporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and\ndispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of\nmanagement and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or\ndisposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.

When determining the estimated service\nperiod for players of the Company’s games, management considers a variety of data points including the weighted-average number of days between the players’ first\nand last days played online, the average total hours played, the average number of days in which the player activity stabilizes, and the weighted-average number of\ndays between players’ first purchase date and last date played online. Management also considers known online trends, the service period of their previously released\ngames, and the service period of their competitors’ games that are similar in nature, to the extent they are publicly available. Determining the estimated service period\nis subjective and requires management’s judgment.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition - determination of the service period for the online\nfunctionality is a critical audit matter are there was significant judgment by management when determining the service period. This in turn led to a high degree of\nauditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and in evaluating audit evidence relating to the data used in developing the service period\nassumption, including the player data assessed by management for historical or comparable titles to determine the weighted-average number of days between players'\nfirst purchase date and last date played online, as well as qualitative factors utilized by management, such as analysis of competitor and industry information.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated\nfinancial statements.

Such fair value was determined based on management’s expectations of future cash flows, long-term\ngrowth rates, and discount rates. The Company recorded a one-time benefit of $230 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2019 for the recognition of a $1.1\nbillion deferred tax asset in the U.K. related to the amortizable tax basis in the transferred intellectual property, net of uncertain tax positions and valuation allowance,\npartially offset by a related $920 million deferred tax liability for U.S. taxes on foreign earnings.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of transferred intellectual property rights that give rise to\ndeferred tax assets is a critical audit matter are there was significant judgment by management in developing the fair value of the intangible assets transferred, which is\nused as the basis for the recording of the deferred tax assets. This led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures to evaluate the\nestimates and assumptions, including, future cash flows, long-term growth rates, and discount rates. In addition, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with\nspecialized skill and knowledge to assist in performing these procedures and evaluating the audit evidence obtained.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated\nfinancial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the valuation of the intangible assets transferred.

We develop and distribute content and\nservices on video game consoles, personal computers (“PC”s), and mobile devices. We also operate esports leagues and offer digital advertising within our content. The\nterms “Activision Blizzard,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” are used to refer collectively to Activision Blizzard, Inc. and its subsidiaries.\nThe Company was originally incorporated in California in 1979 and was reincorporated in Delaware in December 1992. In connection with the 2008 business\ncombination by and among the Company (then known as Activision, Inc.), Vivendi S.A, and Vivendi Games, Inc., pursuant to which we acquired Blizzard\nEntertainment, Inc. (“Blizzard”), we were renamed Activision Blizzard, Inc. On February 23, 2016, we acquired King Digital Entertainment plc, a leading interactive\nmobile entertainment company (\"King\"), by purchasing all of its outstanding shares.\nOur Segments\nBased upon our organizational structure, we conduct our business through three reportable segments, as follows:\n(i) Activision Publishing, Inc.\nActivision Publishing, Inc. (“Activision”) is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive software products and entertainment content, particularly for\nthe console platform. Activision primarily delivers content through retail and digital channels, including full-game and in-game sales, as well as by licensing software\nto third-party or related-party companies that distribute Activision products. Activision develops, markets, and sells products primarily based on our internally\ndeveloped intellectual properties.

Blizzard also includes the\nactivities of the Overwatch LeagueTM, the first major global professional esports league with city-based teams.\nBlizzard’s key product franchises include: World of Warcraft®, a subscription-based massive multi-player online role-playing game for the PC platform; Diablo®,\nan action role-playing franchise for the PC and console platforms; Hearthstone®, an online collectible card franchise for the PC and mobile platforms; and Overwatch®,\na team-based first-person action title for the PC and console platforms.\n(iii) King Digital Entertainment\nKing is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive entertainment content and services, primarily for the mobile platform, including for Google’s\nAndroid and Apple’s iOS. King also distributes its content and services on the PC platform, primarily via Facebook. King’s games are free to play; however, players\ncan acquire in-game items, either with virtual currency or real currency, and we continue to focus on in-game advertising as a growing source of additional revenue.\nKing’s key product franchise is Candy Crush™, which features “match three” games for the mobile and PC platforms.\n    \nF-9\n\n\nTable of Contents\nACTIVISION BLIZZARD, INC.

Going\nforward, Activision no longer has any material rights or obligations related to the Destiny franchise. As a result of the agreement to terminate the relationship, the\nCompany recognized revenues of $164 million and GAAP operating income of $91 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Activision no longer has any\nmaterial rights or obligations related to the Destiny franchise.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Consolidation and Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts and operations of the Company. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been\neliminated. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America\n(“U.S. GAAP”). The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that\naffect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions.\nCertain reclassifications have been made to prior-year amounts to conform to the current period presentation.\nThe Company considers events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date, but before the financial statements are issued, for additional evidence\nrelative to certain estimates or to identify matters that require additional disclosures.\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2019, we identified an error principally related to the initial recognition of income taxes for global intangible low-taxed\nincome (“GILTI”) of foreign subsidiaries which should have been recorded in the three months and year ended December 31, 2018. Income tax expense for the three\nmonths and year ended December 31, 2018 should have been reduced by $35 million. This amount is not material to the consolidated financial statements for the year\nended December 31, 2018, and we have revised our 2018 consolidated financial statements and impacted footnotes in this Form 10-K to reflect this correction.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nWe consider all money market funds and highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be “Cash and cash\nequivalents.”\nInvestment Securities\nInvestments in debt securities designated as available-for-sale are carried at fair value, which is based on quoted market prices for such securities, if available, or\nis estimated on the basis of quoted market prices of financial instruments with similar characteristics. Unrealized gains and losses on the Company’s available-for-sale\ndebt securities are excluded from earnings and are reported as a component of “Other comprehensive income (loss).”\nF-10\n\n\nTable of Contents\nACTIVISION BLIZZARD, INC.

          "chunk": "RIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nInvestments with original maturities greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are normally classified within “Other current\nassets.” Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified within “Other current assets” if they are highly liquid in nature and represent the investment of\ncash that is available for current operations.\nThe specific identification method is used to determine the cost of securities disposed of, with realized gains and losses reflected in “Interest and other expense\n(income), net” in our consolidated statements of operations.\nInvestments in equity securities which are not accounted for under the equity method and for which there is not a readily determinable fair value are carried at\ncost, less impairment, and adjusted for changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investment of the same issuer.\nFinancial Instruments\nThe carrying amounts of “Cash and cash equivalents,” “Accounts receivable, net of allowances,” “Accounts payable,” and “Accrued expenses and other\nliabilities” approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these accounts. Our investments in U.S. treasuries, government agency securities, and corporate\nbonds, if any, are carried at fair value, which is based on quoted market prices for such securities, if available, or is estimated on the basis of quoted market prices of\nfinancial instruments with similar characteristics.\nThe Company transacts business in various foreign currencies and has significant international sales and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, subjecting\nus to foreign currency risk. To mitigate our foreign currency risk resulting from our foreign currency-denominated monetary assets, liabilities, earnings and our foreign\ncurrency risk related to functional currency-equivalent cash flows resulting from our intercompany transactions, we periodically enter into currency derivative\ncontracts, principally forward contracts. These forward contracts generally have a maturity of less than one year. The counterparties for our currency derivative\ncontracts are large and reputable commercial or investment banks.\nWe assess the nature of these derivatives under Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 815 to\ndetermine whether such derivatives should be designated as hedging instruments. The fair value of foreign currency contracts are estimated based on the prevailing\nexchange rates of the various hedged currencies as of the end of the period. We report the fair value of these contracts within “Other current assets,” “Accrued expense\nand other liabilities,” “Other assets,” or “Other liabilities,” as applicable, in our consolidated balance sheets.\nWe do not hold or purchase any foreign currency forward contracts for trading or speculative purposes.\nFor foreign currency forward contracts w",

Inventories are relieved on a weighted-average cost method.\nWe regularly review inventory quantities on-hand and in the retail channels and will write down inventory on-hand based on excess or obsolete inventories,\ndetermined primarily by future anticipated demand for our products. Inventory write-downs are measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and net\nrealizable value, based upon assumptions about future demand, which are inherently difficult to assess and dependent on market conditions. At the point of a loss\nrecognition, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in\nthat newly established basis.\nSoftware Development Costs and Intellectual Property Licenses\nSoftware development costs include payments made to independent software developers under development agreements, as well as direct costs incurred for\ninternally developed products. Software development costs are capitalized once technological feasibility of a product is established and such costs are determined to be\nrecoverable. Technological feasibility of a product requires both technical design documentation and game design documentation, or the completed and tested product\ndesign and a working model. Significant management judgments and estimates are utilized in the assessment of when technological feasibility is established and the\nevaluation is performed on a product-by-product basis. For products where proven technology exists, this may occur early in the development cycle. Software\ndevelopment costs related to online hosted revenue arrangements are capitalized after the preliminary project phase is complete and it is probable that the project will\nbe completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended. Prior to a product’s release, if and when we believe capitalized costs are not recoverable,\nwe expense the amounts as part of “Cost of revenues—software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses.” Capitalized costs for products that are\ncanceled or are expected to be abandoned are charged to “Product development” in the period of cancellation.

For products that are scheduled to be\nreleased in future periods, recoverability is evaluated based on the expected performance of the specific products to which the costs relate or in which the licensed\ntrademark or copyright is to be used. Criteria used to evaluate expected product performance include: historical performance of comparable products developed with\ncomparable technology; market performance of comparable titles; orders for the product prior to its release; general market conditions; and, for any sequel product,\nestimated performance based on the performance of the product on which the sequel is based.

The new standard replaced all current U.S. GAAP guidance on this topic.\nThe new standard, among other things, requires a lessee to classify a lease as either an operating or financing lease, and to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use\n(“ROU”) asset for its leases.

In certain of our lease arrangements, primarily those related to our data center\narrangements, judgment is required in determining if a contract contains a lease. For these arrangements, there is judgment in evaluating if the arrangement provides us\nwith an asset that is physically distinct, or that represents substantially all of the capacity of the asset, and if we have the right to direct the use of the asset. Lease assets\nand liabilities are recognized based on the present value of future lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date. Included in the lease liability are\nfuture lease payments that are fixed, in-substance fixed, or are payments based on an index or rate known at the commencement date of the lease. Variable lease\npayments are recognized as lease expenses as incurred, and generally relate to variable payments made based on the level of services provided by the landlords of our\nleases. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made prior to commencement, initial direct costs incurred, and lease incentives received. As\nmost of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we generally use our incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of future payments. The\nincremental borrowing rate represents the rate required to borrow funds over a similar term to purchase the leased asset, and is based on the information available at the\ncommencement date of the lease. For leased assets with similar lease terms and asset type we applied a portfolio approach in determining a single incremental\nborrowing rate to apply to the leased assets.\nIn determining our lease liability, the lease term includes options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such option.\nFor operating leases, the lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

In such instances, we typically have two performance obligations: (1) a license to the game software that is accessible without an\nInternet connection (predominantly the offline single player campaign or game mode) and (2) ongoing activities associated with the online components of the game,\nsuch as content updates, hosting of online content and gameplay, and online matchmaking (the “online functionality”).

This evaluation is performed for each software\nproduct or product add-on, including downloadable content. When we determine that our software products contain a license of intellectual property (i.e., the offline\nsoftware license) that is separate and distinct from the online functionality, we consider market conditions and other observable inputs to estimate the standalone selling\nprice for the performance obligations, since we do not generally sell the software license on a standalone basis.

Proceeds from the direct sales of virtual goods are similarly recognized as revenues when a player uses the\nvirtual goods. We categorize our virtual goods as either “consumable” or “durable.” Consumable virtual goods represent goods that can be consumed by a specific\nplayer action; accordingly, we recognize revenues from the sale of consumable virtual goods as the goods are consumed and our performance obligation is satisfied.\nDurable virtual goods represent goods that are accessible to the player over an extended period of time; accordingly, we recognize revenues from the sale of durable\nvirtual goods ratably over the period of time the goods are available to the player and our performance obligation is satisfied, which is generally the estimated service\nperiod.\nRevenues from the licensing of intellectual property other than software to third parties primarily include the licensing of our (1) brand, logo, or franchise to\ncustomers and (2) media content. Fixed fee payments from customers for the license of our brand or franchise are generally recognized over the license term. Fixed fee\npayments from customers for the license of our media content are generally recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which may be upfront or over\ntime.\nSignificant Judgment around Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables\nOur contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct\nperformance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. Certain of our games, such as titles in the Call of\nDuty franchise, may contain a license of our intellectual property to play the game offline, but may also depend on a significant level of integration and\ninterdependency with the online functionality. In these cases, significant judgment is required to determine whether this license of our intellectual property should be\nconsidered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the online functionality provided and recognized over time. Generally,\nfor titles in which the software license is functional without the online functionality and a significant component of gameplay is available offline, we believe we have\nseparate performance obligations for the license of the intellectual property and the online functionality.\nSignificant judgment is also required to determine the standalone selling price for each distinct performance obligation and to determine whether there is a\ndiscount tha",

We also consider known online trends, the service periods of our previously\nreleased games, and, to the extent publicly available, the service periods of our competitors’ games that are similar in nature to ours. We believe this provides a\nreasonable depiction of the transfer of services to our customers, as it is the best representation of the time period during which our customers play our games.\nDetermining the estimated service period is subjective and requires management’s judgment. Future usage patterns may differ from historical usage patterns, and\ntherefore the estimated service period may change in the future. The estimated service periods for players of our current games are generally less than 12 months.\nPrincipal Agent Considerations\nWe evaluate sales of our products and content via third-party digital storefronts, such as Microsoft’s Xbox Games Store, Sony’s PSN, the Apple App Store, and\nthe Google Play Store, to determine whether revenues should be reported gross or net of fees retained by the storefront. Key indicators that we evaluate in determining\nwhether we are the principal in the sale (gross reporting) or an agent (net reporting) include, but are not limited to:\n \n•\nwhich party is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified good or service; and\n•\nwhich party has discretion in establishing the price for the specified good or service.\nBased on our evaluation of the above indicators, we report revenues on a gross basis for sales arrangements via the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store,\nand we report revenues on a net basis (i.e., net of fees retained by the digital storefront) for sales arrangements via Microsoft’s Xbox Games Store and Sony’s PSN.\nAllowances for Returns and Price Protection\nWe may permit product returns from, or grant price protection to, ",

In estimating the allowance for\ndoubtful accounts, we analyze the age of current outstanding account balances, historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer creditworthiness, current\neconomic trends, and changes in our customers’ payment terms and their economic condition, as well as whether we can obtain sufficient credit insurance. Any\nsignificant changes in any of these criteria would affect management’s estimates in establishing our allowance for doubtful accounts.\nDeferred revenue is comprised primarily of unearned revenue related to the sale of products with online functionality or online hosted arrangements. We typically\ninvoice, and collect payment for, these sales at the beginning of the contract period and recognize revenue ratably over the estimated service period. Deferred revenue\nalso includes payments for: product sales pending delivery or activation; subscription revenues; licensing revenues with fixed minimum guarantees; and other revenues\nfor which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service.\nRefer to Note 11 for further information, including changes in deferred revenue during the period.\nShipping and Handling\nShipping and handling costs consist primarily of packaging and transportation charges incurred to move finished goods to customers.

However, potential common shares are\nnot included in the denominator of the diluted earnings (loss) per common share calculation when inclusion of such shares would be anti-dilutive, such as in a period in\nwhich a net loss is recorded.\nShare-Based Payments\nWe account for share-based payments in accordance with ASC Subtopic 718-10.

Certain restricted stock units granted to our employees and senior management vest based\non the achievement of pre-established performance or market conditions. For performance-based restricted stock units, each quarter we update our assessment of the\nprobability that the specified performance criteria will be achieved.

For market-based restricted stock units, we estimate the fair value at the date\nof grant using a Monte Carlo valuation methodology and amortize those fair values over the requisite service period, adjusting for estimated forfeitures for each\nseparately vesting tranche of the award. The Monte Carlo methodology that we use to estimate the fair value of market-based restricted stock units at the date of grant\nincorporates into the valuation the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied.

Instead, if an entity forgoes a Step 0 test, that entity\nwill be required to perform its annual or interim goodwill impairment test by (1) comparing the fair value of a reporting unit, as determined in Step 1 from the goodwill\nimpairment test, with its carrying amount and (2) recognizing an impairment charge, if any, for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s\nfair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nFinancial Instruments - Credit Losses\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to accounting for credit losses on financial instruments. The update replaces the existing incurred loss\nimpairment model under current GAAP with a methodology that reflects a current expected credit losses model which requires the use of historical and forward–\nlooking information to calculate credit loss estimates. It also eliminates the concept of other-than-temporary impairment and requires credit losses related to available-\nfor-sale debt securities to be recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than as a reduction in the amortized cost basis of the securities. These changes will\ngenerally result in earlier recognition of credit losses. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and will be applied on a\nmodified retrospective basis, with the cumulative effect of adoption recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings. This standard is effective for us beginning with the\nfirst quarter of 2020 and we do not expect it to have a material impact on our financial statements and related disclosures upon adoption.\nSimplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued new guidance which is intended to simplify various aspects to accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions\nto the general principles in Topic 740 for recognizing deferred taxes for investments, performing an intraperiod allocation and calculating income taxes in interim\nperiods. The amendment also clarifies and amends certain areas of existing guidance to reduce complexity and improve consistency in application of Topic 740. The\nnew standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in any interim period for which financial\nstatements have not yet been issued. Generally the topics must be applied prospectively upon adoption, with the exception of certain topics which are required to be\napplied on a retrospective or modified retrospective basis.

The CODM reviews segment performance exclusive\nof: the impact of the change in deferred revenues and related cost of revenues with respect to certain of our online-enabled games; share-based compensation expense;\namortization of intangible assets as a result of purchase price accounting; fees and other expenses (including legal fees, expenses, and accruals) related to acquisitions,\nassociated integration activities, and financings; certain restructuring and related costs; and certain other non-cash charges. The CODM does not review any\ninformation regarding total assets on an operating segment basis, and accordingly, no disclosure is made with respect thereto.\nOur operating segments are also consistent with our internal organizational structure, the way we assess operating performance and allocate resources, and the\navailability of separate financial information.

Share-Based Payments\nActivision Blizzard Equity Incentive Plans\nOn June 5, 2014, the Activision Blizzard, Inc. 2014 Incentive Plan (the “2014 Plan”) became effective. Under the 2014 Plan, the Compensation Committee of our\nBoard of Directors is authorized to provide share-based compensation in the form of stock options, share appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units,\nperformance shares, and other performance- or value-based awards structured by the Compensation Committee within parameters set forth in the 2014 Plan. As of the\neffective date of the 2014 Plan, we had ceased making awards under our prior equity incentive plans (collectively, the “Prior Plans”), although such plans remain in\neffect to the extent that they cont",

The majority of our options have time-based vesting schedules, generally vesting annually over a period of three\nyears to five years, and expire 10 years from the grant date. In addition, under the terms of the 2014 Plan, the exercise price for the options must be equal to or greater\nthan the closing price per share of our common stock on the date the award is granted, as reported on Nasdaq. Restricted stock units have time-based vesting schedules,\ngenerally vesting in their entirety on an anniversary of the date of grant, or vest annually over a period of three years to five years, and may also be contingent on the\nachievement of specified performance measures.\nAs of the date it was approved by our shareholders, there were 46 million shares available for issuance under the 2014 Plan. The number of shares of our\ncommon stock reserved for issuance under the 2014 Plan has been, and may be further, increased from time to time by: (1) the number of shares relating to awards\noutstanding under any Prior Plan that: (i) expire, or are forfeited, terminated or canceled, without the issuance of shares; (ii) are settled in cash in lieu of shares; or\n(iii) are exchanged, prior to the issuance of shares of our common stock, for awards not involving our common stock; (2) if the exercise price of any option outstanding\nunder any Prior Plans is, or the tax withholding requirements with respect to any award outstanding under any Prior Plans are, satisfied by withholding shares\notherwise then deliverable in respect of the award or the actual or constructive transfer to the Company of shares already owned, the number of shares equal to the\nwithheld or transferred shares; and (3) if a share appreciation right is exercised and settled in shares, a number of shares equal to the difference between the total\nnumber of shares with respect to which the award is exercised and the number of shares actually issued or transferred. As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately\n24 million shares of our common stock reserved for future issuance under the 2014 Plan. Shares issued in connection with awards made under the 2014 Plan are\ngenerally issued as new stock issuances.\nFair Value Valuation Assumptions\nValuation of Stock Options\nThe fair value of stock options granted are principally estimated using a binomial-lattice model. The inputs in our binomial-lattice model include expected stock\nprice volatility, risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, contractual term, and vesting schedule, as well as measures of employees’ cancellations, exercise, and post-\nvesting termination behavior. Statistical methods are used to estimate employee termination rates.\nThe following table presents the weighted-average assumptions, weighted avera",

A binomial-lattice model assumes that employees will exercise their options when the stock price equals or exceeds an exercise\nmultiple. The exercise multiple is based on historical employee exercise behaviors.\nVolatility\nTo estimate volatility for the binomial-lattice model, we consider the implied volatility of exchange-traded options on our stock to estimate short-term volatility,\nthe historical volatility of our common shares during the option’s contractual term to estimate long-term volatility, and a statistical model to estimate the transition from\nshort-term volatility to long-term volatility.\nRisk-free interest rate\nAs is the case for volatility, the risk-free interest rate is assumed to change during the option’s contractual term. The risk-free interest rate, which is based on U.S.\nTreasury yield curves, reflects the expected movement in the interest rate from one time period to the next (“forward rate”).\nDividend yield\nThe expected dividend yield assumption is based on our historical and expected future amount of dividend payouts.\nShare-based compensation expense recognized is based on awards ultimately expected to vest and therefore has been reduced for estimated forfeitures.\nForfeitures are estimated at the time of grant based on historical experience and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those\nestimates.\nF-44\n\n\nTable of Contents\nACTIVISION BLIZZARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nValuation of Restricted Stock Units (“RSUs”)\nThe fair value of the Company’s RSU awards granted is principally based upon the closing price of the Company’s stock price on the date of grant reduced by the\npresent value of dividends expected to be paid on our common stock prior to vesting.\nAccuracy of Fair Value Estimates\nWe developed the assumptions used in the models above, including measures of employees’ exercise and post-vesting termination behavior. Our ability to\naccurately estimate the fair value of share-based payment awards at the grant date depends upon the accuracy of the model and our ability to accurately forecast model\ninputs for as long as 10 years into the future.

The transfer did not result in a taxable gain; however, our U.K. subsidiary received a step-up in tax basis based on the fair value of\nthe transferred intellectual property rights. Such fair value was determined based on our expectations of future cash flows, long-term growth rates, and discount rates.\nWe recorded a one-time benefit of $230 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2019 for the recognition of a $1.1 billion deferred tax asset in the U.K. related to the\namortizable tax basis in the transferred intellectual property, net of uncertain tax positions and valuation allowance, partially offset by a related $920 million deferred\ntax liability for U.S. taxes on foreign earnings. The U.K. amortizable tax basis will be recovered over a period of three years to 25 years and the related deferred tax\nasset was measured using the enacted U.K. corporate tax rates for the years in which the amortization will be realized. We recorded a valuation allowance of $110\nmillion for the portion of the deferred tax asset for which it is more-likely-than-not that a benefit will not be realized based on objective evidence available as of\nDecember 31, 2019. We will update the measurement and realizability analysis going forward and record the impact from any change in determination in the period of\nthe change.    \nOn June 27, 2018, we entered into a closing agreement with the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) to resolve certain intercompany transfer pricing arrangements\nfor tax periods starting in 2009 (the “Closing Agreement”). The primary adjustments related to the Closing Agreement were recognized in the second quarter of 2018\nand consisted of a tax expense of $70 million and a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits of $437 million. In addition, we recognized $185 million of tax benefits\nrelated to other tax adjustments resulting from the changes in U.S. tax attributes and taxable income caused by the primary adjustments. The Closing Agreement\nresulted in federal and state cash tax payments totaling approximately $345 million, of which federal tax payments of $334 million were made in October 2018.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. Tax Reform Act was enacted. The U.S. Tax Reform Act, among other things, reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from\n35% to 21%, beginning in 2018, and implemented the Transition Tax. In the fourth quarter",

We record a valuation allowance for assets that do not meet the threshold of “more likely than not”\nto be realized in the future. To make that determination, we evaluate the likelihood of realization based on the weight of all positive and negative evidence available. As\na result of the Closing Agreement, we received in 2018, we determined at that time that our remaining California research and development credit carryforwards\n(“CA R&D Credit”) no longer met the threshold of more likely than not to be realized in the future.

The IRS is currently\nexamining our federal tax returns for the 2012 through 2016 tax years. We also have several state and non-U.S. audits pending. In addition, as part of purchase price\naccounting for our 2016 acquisition of King, we assumed $74 million of uncertain tax positions primarily related to pre-acquisition transfer pricing matters. We\nanticipate resolving King’s transfer pricing for both pre- and post-acquisition tax years through a collaborative multilateral process with the tax authorities in the\nrelevant jurisdictions, which include the U.K. and Sweden. While the outcome of this process remains uncertain, it could result in an agreement that changes the\nallocation of profits and losses between these and other relevant jurisdictions or a failure to reach an agreement that results in unilateral adjustments to the amount and\ntiming of taxable income in the jurisdictions in which King operates.\nIn December 2018, we received a decision from the Swedish Tax Agency (the “STA”) informing us of an audit assessment of a Swedish subsidiary of King for\nthe 2016 tax year (the “Initial Decision”). The Initial Decision described the basis for issuing a transfer pricing assessment of approximately 3.5kr billion\n(approximately $375 million), primarily concerning an alleged intercompany asset transfer. On June 17, 2019, we received a reassessment from the STA (the\n“Reassessment”) which changed the Initial Decision based on a revision of the transfer pricing approach reflected in King’s 2016 Swedish tax return and removal of the\nalleged intercompany asset transfer that was the basis of the Initial Decision. The STA also, at the same time, reassessed the 2017 tax year on the same transfer pricing\nbasis as 2016. The transfer pricing approach reflected in the Reassessment for both 2016 and 2017 remains subject to further review by taxing authorities in other\njurisdictions. In July 2019, the Company made a payment to the STA for the Reassessment for the 2016 and 2017 tax years, which did not result in a significant impact\nto our consolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2017, we received a Notice of Reassessment from the French Tax Authority (the “FTA”) related to transfer pricing for intercompany transactions\ninvolving one of our French subsidiaries for the 2011 through 2013 tax years.

In\ngeneral, a “business combination” includes, among other things, a merger or consolidation involving us and the “interested stockholder” and the sale of more than 10%\nof our assets. In general, an “interested stockholder” is any entity or person beneficially owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock and any entity or person\naffiliated with or controlling or controlled by such entity or person.\nA Delaware corporation may “opt out” of these provisions with an express provision in its original certificate of incorporation or an express provision in its\ncertificate of incorporation or bylaws resulting from a stockholders’ amendment approved by at least a majority of the outstanding voting shares.

We also operate esports leagues and offer digital advertising within our content.

In connection with the 2008 business\ncombination by and among the Company (then known as Activision, Inc.), Vivendi S.A, and Vivendi Games, Inc., pursuant to which we acquired Blizzard\nEntertainment, Inc. (“Blizzard”), we were renamed Activision Blizzard, Inc. On February 23, 2016, we acquired King Digital Entertainment plc, a leading interactive\nmobile entertainment company (\"King\"), by purchasing all of its outstanding shares.\nOur Strategy and Vision\nOur objective is to continue to be a worldwide leader in the development, publishing, and distribution of high-quality interactive entertainment content and\nservices, as well as",

In pursuit of this objective, we focus on three strategic pillars:\nexpanding audience reach; driving deep consumer engagement; and providing more opportunities for player investment.\nExpanding audience reach. Building on our strong established franchises and creating new franchises through compelling new content is at the core of our\nbusiness. We endeavor to reach as many consumers as possible either through: (1) the purchase of our content and services; (2) engagement in our free-to-play games,\nwhich allow consumers to play games with no up-front cost but provide for player investment through sales of downloadable content or via microtransactions; or (3)\nengagement in other types of media based on our franchises, such as esports.\nDriving deep consumer engagement. Our high-quality entertainment content not only expands our audience reach, but it also drives deep engagement with our\nfranchises. We design our games, as well as related media, to provide a depth of content that keeps consumers engaged for a long period of time following a game’s\nrelease, delivering more value to our players and additional growth opportunities for our franchises.\nProviding more opportunities for player investment. Increasingly, our consumers are connected to our games online through consoles, PCs, and mobile devices.\nThis allows us to offer additional digital player investment opportunities directly to our consumers on a year-round basis. In addition to purchasing full games or\nsubscriptions, players can invest in certain of our games and franchises by purchasing incremental “in-game” content (including larger downloadable content or smaller\ncontent, via microtransactions). These digital revenue streams tend to be more recurring and have relatively higher profit margins. Further, if executed properly,\nadditional player investment can increase engagement as it provides more frequent and incremental content for our players. In addition, we generate revenue through\noffering advertising within certain of our franchises, and we believe there are opportunities to grow new forms of player investment through esports and consumer\nproducts. We are still in the early stages of developing these new revenue streams.\nReportable Segments\nBased upon our organizational structure, we conduct our business through three reportable segments as follows:\n(i) Activision Publishing, Inc.\nActivision Publishing, Inc. (“Activision”) is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive software products and entertainment content, particularly for\nthe console platform. Activision primarily delivers content through retail and digital channels, including full-game and in-game sales, as well as by licensing software\nto third-party or related-party companies that distribute Activision products.

Blizzard\nprimarily delivers content through retail and digital channels, including subscriptions, full-game, and in-game sales, as well as by licensing software to third-party or\nrelated-party companies that distribute Blizzard products. Blizzard also maintains a proprietary online gaming service, Blizzard Battle.net®, which facilitates digital\ndistribution of Blizzard content and selected Activision content, online social connectivity, and the creation of user-generated content. Blizzard also includes the\nactivities of the Overwatch LeagueTM, the first major global professional esports league with city-based teams.\n    \nBlizzard’s key product franchises include: World of Warcraft®, a subscription-based massive multi-player online role-playing game for the PC platform; Diablo®,\nan action role-playing franchise for the PC and console platforms; Hearthstone®, an online collectible card franchise for the PC and mobile platforms; and Overwatch®,\na team-based first-person action title for the PC and console platforms.\n(iii) King Digital Entertainment\nKing is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive entertainment content and services, particularly for the mobile platform, including for Google’s\nAndroid and Apple’s iOS. King also distributes its content and services on the PC platform, primarily via Facebook. King’s games are free to play; however, players\ncan acquire in-game items, either with virtual currency or real currency, and we continue to focus on in-game advertising as a growing source of additional revenue.\nKing’s key product franchise is Candy Crush™, which features “match three” games for the mobile and PC platforms.\nOther\nWe also engage in other businesses that do not represent reportable segments, including the Activision Blizzard Distribution (“Distribution”) business, which\nconsists of operations in Europe that provide warehousing, logistics, and sales distribution se",

Our products span various genres, including first- and third-person action/adventure, role-playing, strategy, and “match three,” among\nothers. We primarily offer the following products and services:\n•\nfull-games, which typically provide access to main game content, primarily for console or PC;\n•\ndownloadable content, which provides players with additional in-game content to purchase following the purchase of a full game;\n•\nmicrotransactions, which typically provide relatively small pieces of additional in-game content or enhancements to gameplay, generally at relatively low\nprice points; and\n•\nsubscriptions for players in our World of Warcraft franchise that provide for continual access to the game content.\nProviding additional opportunities for player investment outside of full-game purchases has allowed us to shift from our historical seasonality to a more\nconsistently recurring and year-round revenue model. In addition, if executed properly, it allows us to increase player engagement with our games and content.\n5\n\n\nTable of Contents\nProduct Development and Support\nWe focus on developing enduring franchises backed by well-designed, high-quality games with regular content updates.

We believe this model allows\nus to deploy the best resources for a given task, by supplementing our internal expertise with top-quality external resources on an as-needed basis.\nWhile most of the content for our franchises is developed by our internal studios, we periodically engage independent third-party developers to create content on\nour beha",

Further, competitors may develop content that imitates or competes with our best‑selling games, potentially reducing our\nsales or our ability to charge the same prices we have historically charged for our products. These competing products may take a larger share of consumer spending\nthan anticipated, which could cause product sales to fall below expectations. If we do not continue to develop consistently high‑quality and well‑received games or\nenhancements to those games, if our marketing fails to resonate with our consumers, or if consumers lose interest in a genre of games we produce, our revenues and\nprofit margins could decline. In addition, our own best‑selling products could compete with our other games, reducing sales for those other games. Further, a failure by\nus to develop a high‑quality product, or our development of a product that is otherwise not well‑received, could potentially result in additional expenditures to respond\nto consumer demands, harm our reputation, and increase the likelihood that our future products will not be well‑received. The increased importance of downloadable\ncontent to our business amplifies these risks, as downloadable content for poorly‑received games typically generates lower‑than‑expected sales. The increased demand\nfor consistent enhancement to our products also requires a greater allocation of financial resources to those products.\nAdditionally, consumer expectations regarding the quality, performance and integrity of our products and services are high. Consumers may be critical of our\nbrands, games, services, and/or business practices for a wide variety of reasons, and such negative reactions may not be foreseeable or within our control to manage\neffectively. For example, if our games or services, such as our proprietary online gaming service, do not function as consumers expect, whether because they fail to\nfunction as advertised or otherwise, our sales may suffer. The risk that this may occur is particularly pronounced with respect to our games with online features because\nthey involve ongoing consumer expectations, which we may not be able to consistently satisfy. Our games with online features are also frequently updated, increasing\nthe risk that a game may contain significant errors, or “bugs.” If any of these issues occur, consumers may stop playing the game and may be less likely to return to the\ngame as often in the future, which may negatively impact our business.\nFurther, delays in product releases or disruptions following the commercial release of one or more new products could negatively impact our business and\nreputation and could cause our results of operations to be materially different from expectations.

The increased importance\nof digital channels in our industry increases our potential competition, as the minimum capital needed to produce and publish a digitally delivered game, particularly a\ngame for a mobile platform, may be significantly less than that needed to produce and publish one that is purchased through retail distribution and is played on a game\nconsole or PC. Also, while digitally-distributed products generally have higher profit margins than retail sales, as business shifts to digital distribution, the volume of\norders from retailers for physical discs has been, and may continue to be, reduced. Further, some of the providers of the platforms through which we digitally distribute\ncontent are also publishers of their own content distributed on those platforms, and, therefore, a platform provider may give priority to its own products or those of our\ncompetitors.\nThe importance of retail sales to our business exposes us to the risks of that business model.\nWhile the proportion of our revenues derived from digital distribution channels, as compared to traditional retail sales, continues to increase, retail sales remain\nimportant to our business.

During these periods, sales of the game\nconsole entertainment software products we publish may decline until new platforms achieve wide consumer acceptance. Console transitions may have a comparable\nimpact on sales of downloadable content, amplifying the impact on our revenues. This decline may not be offset by increased sales of products for the next-generation\nconsoles. In addition, as console hardware moves through its life cycle, hardware manufacturers typically enact price reductions, and decreasing prices may put\ndownward pressure on software prices. During console transitions, we may simultaneously incur costs both in continuing to develop and market new titles for\nprior‑generation video game platforms, which may not sell at premium prices, and also in developing products for next‑generation platforms, which may not generate\nimmediate or near‑term revenues. As a result, our business and operating results may be more volatile and difficult to predict during console transitions than during\nother times.\nOur business is highly dependent on the success and availability of video game consoles manufactured by third parties, as well as our ability to develop\ncommercially successful products for these consoles.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenues from the sale of products for play on video game consoles manufactured by third parties, such as Sony’s PS4,\nMicrosoft’s Xbox One, and Nintendo’s Switch. Sales of products for consoles accounted for 30% of our consolidated net revenues in 2019. The success of our console\nbusiness is driven in large part by our ability to accurately predict which consoles will be successful in the marketplace and our ability to develop commercially\nsuccessful products for these consoles. We also rely on the availability of an adequate supply of these video game consoles and the continued support for these consoles\nby their manufacturers, including our ability to reach consumers via the online networks operated by these console manufacturers.

For example, we may invest in the development of new\nfree‑to‑play interactive entertainment products that do not achieve significant commercial success, in which case our revenues from those products likely will be lower\nthan anticipated and we may not recover our development costs.

Activision\nprimarily delivers content through retail and digital channels, including full-game and in-game sales, as well as by licensing software to third-party or related-party\ncompanies that distribute Activision products. Activision develops, markets, and sells products primarily based on our internally developed intellectual properties.\nActivision also includes the activities of the Call of Duty League, a global professional esports league with city-based teams for Call of Duty.\n(ii) Blizzard\nBlizzard is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive software products and entertainment content, particularly for the PC platform. Blizzard\nprimarily delivers content through retail and digital channels, including subscriptions, full-game, and in-game sales, as well as by licensing software to third-party or\nrelated-party companies that distribute Blizzard products.

Effective December 31, 2018, Activision and\nBungie mutually agreed to terminate their publishing relationship related to the Destiny franchise. As part of this termination, Activision agreed to transfer its\npublishing rights for the Destiny franchise to Bungie in exchange for cash and Bungie’s assumption of on-going customer obligations of Activision.

Revenue recognized at a “point-in-time” is primarily comprised of the portion of revenue from\nsoftware products that is recognized when the customer takes control of the product (i.e., upon delivery of the software product) and revenues from our Distribution\nbusiness. “Over-time and other revenue” is primarily comprised of revenue associated with the online functionality of our games, in-game purchases, and subscriptions.\nContent Release and Event Highlights\nGames and downloadable content that were released during 2019, include:\n•\nActivision’s Sekiro\nTM: Shadows Die Twice;\n•\nActivision’s Crash\nTM Team Racing Nitro-Fueled;\n•\nActivision’s Spyro® Reignited Trilogy on Nintendo Switch and PC;\n•\nActivision’s Call of Duty: Mobile;\n•\nActivision’s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare;\n•\nBlizzard’s World of Warcraft® Classic; and\n•\nBlizzard’s latest expansions to Hearthstone—Rise of Shadows\nTM, Saviors of Uldum\nTM, Tombs of Terror\nTM,, and Descent of Dragons\nTM.\n32\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe Overwatch League, the first major global professional esports league with city-based teams, completed its second season in 2019 and began its third season\nin February 2020. During 2019, we also sold the first 12 teams for the Call of Duty League, which began its first season in January 2020.\nInternational Sales\nInternational sales are a fundamental part of our business. An important element of our international strategy is to develop content that is specifically directed\ntoward local cultures and customs. Net revenues from international sales accounted for approximately 54%, 54%, and 55% of our total consolidated net revenues for\nthe years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The majority of our net revenues from foreign countries are generated by consumers in Australia,\nBrazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Our international business is subject to\nrisks typical of an international business, including, but not limited to, foreign currency exchange rate volatility and changes in local economies. Accordingly, our\nfuture results could be materially and adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in local economies.\nOperating Metrics\nThe following operating metrics are key performance indicators that we use to evaluate our business. The key drivers of changes in our operating metrics are\npresented in the order of significance.\nNet bookings and In-game net bookings\nWe monitor net bookings as a key operating metric in evaluating the performance of our business because it enables an analysis of performance based on the\ntiming of actual transactions with our customers and provides more timely indic",

We calculate average MAUs in a period by adding the total number of MAUs in each of the months in a given period and dividing that total by\nthe number of months in the period. An individual who accesses two of our games would be counted as two users. In addition, due to technical limitations, for\nActivision and King, an individual who accesses the same game on two platforms or devices in the relevant period would be counted as two users. For Blizzard, an\nindividual who accesses the same game on two platforms or devices in the relevant period would generally be counted as a single user. In certain instances, we rely on\nthird parties to publish our games. In these instances, MAU data is based on information provided to us by those third parties, or, if final data is not available,\nreasonable estimates of MAUs for these third-party published games.\nThe number of MAUs for a given period can be significantly impacted by the timing of new content releases, since new releases may cause a temporary surge in\nMAUs. Accordingly, although we believe that overall trending in the number of MAUs can be a meaningful performance metric, period-to-period fluctuations may not\nbe indicative of longer-term trends.

          "chunk": "13% annually from 2016 to 2019. The industry continues to benefit from additional players entering the market as interactive\nentertainment becomes more commonplace across age groups and as more developing regions gain access to this form of entertainment.\nFurther, wide adoption of smartphones globally and the free-to-play business model on those platforms has increased the total addressable audience for gaming\nsignificantly by introducing gaming to new age groups and new regions and allowing gaming to occur more widely outside the home. Mobile gaming is estimated to be\nlarger than console and PC gaming, and continues to grow at a significant rate. King is a leading developer of mobile and free-to-play games, and our other business\nunits have mobile efforts underway that present the opportunity for us to expand the reach of, and drive additional player investment in our franchises. The October\n2019 launch of Call of Duty: Mobile is an example of these efforts.\nOpportunities to Expand Franchises Outside of Games\nOur fans spend significant time engaging in our franchises and investing through purchases of our game content, including full games, downloadable content and\nmicrotransactions. Given the passion our players have for our franchises, we believe there are emerging opportunities to drive additional engagement and investment in\nour franchises outside of games. Our efforts to build these adjacent opportunities are still relatively nascent, but we view them as potentially significant sources of\nfuture revenues.\nFor example, as part of our efforts to take advantage of esports opportunities, we have sold rights for 20 teams that are participating in the Overwatch League,\nwhich recently began its third season in February 2020, and, during 2019, we sold rights for the first 12 teams for the Call of Duty League, which began its first season\nin January 2020.\nConcentration of Sales Among the Most Popular Franchises\nThe concentration of retail revenues among key titles has continued as a trend in the overall interactive entertainment industry. According to The NPD Group, the\ntop 10 titles accounted for 33% of the retail sales in the U.S. interactive entertainment industry in 2019. Similarly, a significant portion of our revenues historically has\nbeen derived from video games based on a few popular franchises, and these video games have also been responsible for a disproportionately high percentage of our\nprofits. For example, in 2019, the Call of Duty, Candy Crush, and World of Warcraft franchises, collectively, accounted for 67% of our consolidated net revenues—and\na significantly higher percentage of our operating income.\nThe top titles in the industry are also becoming more consistent as players and revenues concentrate more heavily in established franchises. Of the top 10 console\nfranchises in the U.S. in 2019, all 10 are from established franchises. Similarly, according to U.S rankings for the Apple App Store and Google Play Store per App\nAnnie Inte",

Further, while there is no guarantee of success, we invest in new properties in an effort to develop future top\nfranchises. For example, in 2014, we released Hearthstone, and in 2016, we released Overwatch. Additionally, to diversify our portfolio of key franchises and increase\nour presence on the mobile platform, in 2016, we acquired King. We also have been focusing on expanding our franchises to the mobile platform, as demonstrated by\nthe recently released Call of Duty: Mobile, as well as our plans for Diablo Immortal\nTM , which is currently in development.\nOverall, we do expect that a limited number of popular franchises will continue to produce a disproportionately high percentage of our, and the industry’s,\nrevenues and profits in the near future. Accordingly, our ability to maintain our top franchises and our ability to successfully compete against our competitors’ top\nfranchises can significantly impact our performance.\nRecurring Revenue Business Models and Seasonality\nIncreased consumer online connectivity has allowed us to offer players new investment opportunities and to shift our business further towards a more consistently\nrecurring and year-round model. Offering downloadable content and microtransactions, in addition to full games, allows our players to access and invest in new content\nthroughout the year. This incremental content not only provides additional high-margin revenues, it can also increase player engagement. Also, mobile games, and free-\nto-play games more broadly, are generally less seasonal than premium games developed primarily for the console or PC platforms.\nWhile our business is shifting toward a year-round engagement model, the interactive entertainment industry remains somewhat seasonal. We have historically\nexperienced our highest sales volume, particularly for Activision, in the calendar year-end holiday buying season.\nOutlook\nIn the second half of 2020, we plan to release the next premium title in our Call of Duty franchise and the next expansion for World of Warcraft, World of\nWarcraft: Shadowlands. In addition, throughout the year we expect to deliver ongoing content for our various franchises, including continued in-game content for Call\nof Duty: Modern Warfare and Call of Duty: Mobile, expansion packs and content updates for Hearthstone, in-game events for Overwatch, and continued releases of\ncontent, features, and services across King’s portfolio with an ongoing focus on the Candy Crush franchise.

Our full year 2019 effective tax rate of 8%\nis lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 21% primarily due to one-time tax benefits related to the intra-entity transfer of certain intellectual property rights, as further\ndescribed below, and earnings taxed at relatively lower rates in foreign jurisdictions, partially offset by changes in the Company's liability for uncertain tax positions\nand audit settlements.\nThe effective tax rate in 2019 was higher than in 2018, primarily due to one-time tax benefits reported in the prior year related to the U.S. Tax Reform Act and an\nIRS audit settlement. This increase was partially offset by one-time tax benefits reported in the current year related to the intra-entity transfer of certain intellectual\nproperty rights, net of changes in the Company’s liability for uncertain tax positions in the current year.\nThe overall effective income tax rate in future periods will depend on a variety of factors, such as changes in pre-tax income or loss by jurisdiction, applicable\naccounting rules, applicable tax laws and regulations, and rulings and interpretations thereof, developments in tax audits and other matters, and variations in the\nestimated and actual level of annual pre-tax income or loss.\nIntellectual Property Right Transfer\nIn October 2019, we completed an intra-entity transfer of certain intellectual property rights to one of our subsidiaries in the U.K., aligning the ownership of these\nrights with our evolving business.

The total assessment, including interest and penalties, was approximately €571 million (approximately $638 million).\nIn December 2019, the Company reached a settlement with the FTA for the 2011 through 2018 tax years, resulting in the recognition of $54 million of tax expense in\nthe period ended December 31, 2019 and a tax payment of €161 million (approximately $179 million), including interest and penalties, in January 2020.\nIRS Closing Agreement\nOn June 27, 2018, we entered into a closing agreement with the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) to resolve certain intercompany transfer pricing arrangements\nfor tax periods starting in 2009 (the “Closing Agreement”). The primary adjustments related to the Closing Agreement were recognized in the second quarter of 2018\nand consisted of a tax expense of $70 million and a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits of $437 million. In addition, we recognized $185 million of tax benefits\nrelated to other tax adjustments resulting from the changes in U.S. tax attributes and taxable income caused by the primary adjustments. The Closing Agreement\nresulted in federal and state cash tax payments totaling approximately $345 million, of which federal tax payments of $334 million were made in October 2018.\nU.S. Tax Reform Act\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. Tax Reform Act was enacted. The U.S. Tax Reform Act, among other things, reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from\n35% to 21% beginning in 2018 and implemented a modified territorial tax system that imposed a one-time tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries\n(the “Transition Tax”). In the fourth quarter of 2018, we completed our analysis of the effect of the U.S. Tax Reform Act. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we\nrecorded a net tax benefit of $340 million for the effects of the U.S. Tax Reform Act.

The changes are primarily due to changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro and British pound and its impact on\nour foreign operating income.\nComparison of 2018 to 2017\nFor the comparison of 2018 to 2017, refer to Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, filed with the SEC on February 28, 2019.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe believe our ability to generate cash flows from operating activities is one of our fundamental financial strengths. In the near term, we expect our business and\nfinancial condition to remain strong and to continue to generate significant operating cash flows, which, we believe, in combination with our existing balance of cash\nand cash equivalents and short-term investments of $5.9 billion, our access to capital, and the availability of our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, will be sufficient\nto finance our operational and financing requirements for the next 12 months.

These cash balances are generally available for use in the U.S., subject in some cases to certain restrictions.\nOur cash provided from operating activities is somewhat impacted by seasonality.

Actual results could differ\nfrom those estimates and assumptions. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed throughout Management’s\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results. The policies,\nestimates, and assumptions discussed below are considered by management to be critical because they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and\nresults of operations and because their application places the most significant demands on management’s judgment, with financial reporting results relying on estimates\nand assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Specific risks for these critical accounting policies, estimates, and assumptions are described\nin the following paragraphs.\nAdoption of Accounting Standards Codification 606: Revenue from Contracts with Customers\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued new accounting guidance related to revenue recognition.

For these products, we recognize\nrevenues on the later of the street date and the date the product is sold to our customer. For digital full-game downloads sold to customers, we recognize revenue when\nit is available for download or is activated for gameplay.

In such instances, we typically have two performance obligations: (1) a license to the game software that is accessible without an\nInternet connection (predominantly the offline single player campaign or game mode) and (2) ongoing activities associated with the online components of the game,\nsuch as content updates, hosting of online content and gameplay, and online matchmaking (the “online functionality”). The online functionality generally operates to\nsupport the additional features and functionalities of the game that are only available online, not the offline license. This evaluation is performed for each software\nproduct or product add-on, including downloadable content. When we determine that our software products contain a license of intellectual property (i.e., the offline\nsoftware license) that is separate and distinct from the online functionality, we consider market conditions and other observable inputs to estimate the standalone selling\nprice for the performance obligations, since we do not generally sell the software license on a standalone basis.

Revenues related to online hosted software arrangements are generally recognized ratably over the estimated service period.\nSubscription, Licensing, and Other Revenues\nSubscription Arrangements\nSubscription revenue arrangements are mostly derived from World of Warcraft, which is playable through Blizzard’s servers and is generally sold on a\nsubscription-only basis. Revenues associated with the sales of subscriptions are deferred until the subscription service is activated by the consumer and are then\nrecognized ratably over the subscription period as the performance obligations are satisfied.\nRevenues attributable to the purchase of World of Warcraft software by our customers, including expansion packs, are classified as “Product sales,” whereas\nrevenues attributable to subscriptions and other in-game revenues are classified as “Subscription, licensing, and other revenues.”\nSoftware Licensing Revenues\nIn certain countries, we utilize third-party licensees to distribute and host our games in accordance with license agreements, for which the licensees typically pay\nus a fixed minimum guarantee and sales-based royalties.

Based on the allocated\ntransaction price, we recognize revenue associated with the minimum guarantee (1) when we transfer control of the upfront license of intellectual property, (2) upon\ntransfer of control of future specified updates, and/or (3) ratably over the contractual term in which we provide the customer with unspecified future updates.

These revenues are recognized in \"Subscriptions, licensing, and other revenues\" on our consolidated statement of operations.\nMicrotransaction revenues are derived from the sale of virtual currencies and goods to our players to enhance their gameplay experience.

Proceeds from the direct sales of virtual goods are similarly recognized as revenues when a player uses the\nvirtual goods.

In limited instances, we may also utilize an expected cost\napproach to determine whether the estimated selling price yields an appropriate profit margin.\nEstimated Service Period\nWe consider a variety of data points when determining the estimated service period for players of our games, including the weighted average number of days\nbetween players’ first and last days played online, the average total hours played, the average number of days in which player activity stabilizes, and the weighted-\naverage number of days between players’ first purchase date and last date played online.

In accordance with ASC Topic 740, the provision for income\ntaxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences\nattributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating losses and tax\ncredit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary\ndifferences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities due to a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that\nincludes the enactment date. We evaluate deferred tax assets each period for recoverability. For those assets that do not meet the threshold of “more likely than not” that\nthey will be realized in the future, a valuation allowance is recorded.\nManagement believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies,\ntogether with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets. In the event that all or part of the net\ndeferred tax assets are determined not to be realizable in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to tax expense in the period such\ndetermination is made. The calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of ASC Topic 740 and\ncomplex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on our business and results\nof operations in an interim period in which the uncertainties are ultimately resolved.\nSignificant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our reserves are\nreasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax\nprovisions and accruals.

Technological feasibility of a product requires both technical design documentation and game design documentation, or the completed and tested\nproduct design and a working model. Significant management judgments and estimates are utilized in the assessment of when technological feasibility is established\nand the evaluation is performed on a product-by-product basis. For products where proven technology exists, this may occur early in the development cycle. Software\ndevelopment costs related to online hosted revenue arrangements are capitalized after the preliminary project phase is complete and it is probable that the project will\nbe completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended. Prior to a product’s release, if and when we believe capitalized costs are not recoverable,\nwe expense the amounts as part of “Cost of revenues—software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses.” Capitalized costs for products that are\ncanceled or are expected to be abandoned are charged to “Product development” in the period of cancellation. Amounts related to software development which are not\ncapitalized are charged immediately to “Product development.”\nCommencing upon a product’s release, capitalized software development costs are amortized to “Cost of revenues—software royalties, amortization, and\nintellectual property licenses” based on the ratio of current revenues to total projected revenues for the specific product, generally resulting in an amortization period of\nsix months to approximately two years.\nWe evaluate the future recoverability of capitalized software development costs on a quarterly basis.

Material differences may result in the amount and timing of expenses for any period if\nmatters resolve in a manner that is inconsistent with management’s expectations.\nFair Value Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements often requires us to determine the fair value of a particular item to fairly present in our consolidated financial statements.\nWithout an independent market or another representative transaction, determining the fair value of a particular item requires us to make several assumptions that are\ninherently difficult to predict and can have a material impact on the conclusion of the appropriate accounting.\n58\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThere are various valuation techniques used to estimate fair value. These include: (1) the market approach, where market transactions for identical or comparable\nassets or liabilities are used to determine the fair value; (2) the income approach, which uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts (for example, future cash\nflows or future earnings) to a single present amount; and (3) the cost approach, which is based on the amount that would be required to replace an asset. For many of\nour fair value estimates, we use the income approach. Using the income approach requires the use of financial models, which require us to make various estimates\nincluding, but not limited to: (1) the potential future cash flows for the asset, liability or equity instrument being measured; (2) the timing of receipt or payment of those\nfuture cash flows; (3) the time value of money associated with the delayed receipt or payment of such cash flows; and (4) the inherent risk associated with the cash\nflows (that is, the risk premium). Determining these cash flow estimates is inherently difficult and subjective, and, if any of the estimates used to determine the fair\nvalue using the income approach turns out to be inaccurate, our financial results may be negatively impacted. Furthermore, relatively small changes in many of these\nestimates can have a significant impact on the estimated fair value resulting from the financial models or the related accounting conclusion reached. For example, a\nrelatively small change in the estimated fair value of an asset may change a conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired. While we are required to make certain fair\nvalue assessments associated with the accounting for several types of transactions, the following areas are the most sensitive to the assessments:\nAssessment of Impairment of Goodwill and Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets\nWe are required to test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and, if current events or circumstances require, on\nan interim basis.

If a qualitative assessment is not used, or if the qualitative assessment is not conclusive, a quantitative impairment test is performed. For goodwill, the first\nstep of the quantitative test measures for impairment by applying fair value-based tests at the reporting unit level. The second step (if necessary) measures the amount\nof impairment by applying fair value-based tests to the individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit. We perform our annual impairment test as of\nDecember 31.\nIn the instances when a quantitative test is performed, we use a discounted cash flow approach to determine the fair values of the reporting units in performing\nthe first step. Each step requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include long-\nterm growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates based on our weighted average cost of capital, and\nfuture economic and market conditions. These estimates and assumptions must be made for each reporting unit evaluated for impairment. Our estimates for market\ngrowth, our market share and costs are based on historical data, various internal estimates and certain external sources, as well as on assumptions that are consistent\nwith the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business. If future forecasts are revised, they may indicate or require future impairment charges.\nAssumptions used in our estimates are unpredictable and inherently uncertain, but we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable. Actual\nfuture results may differ from those estimates. Based on our annual impairment assessment, no impairments of goodwill were identified for the years ended December\n31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.\nWe test our acquired trade names for possible impairment by applying the same process as for goodwill.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nMarket risk is the potential loss arising from fluctuations in market rates and prices. Our market risk exposures primarily include fluctuations in foreign currency\nexchange rates and interest rates.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nWe transact business in many different foreign currencies and may be exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange\nrates. Revenues and related expenses generated from our international operations are generally denominated in their respective local currencies. Primary currencies\ninclude euros, British pounds, Australian dollars, South Korean won, Chinese yuan, and Swedish krona. To the extent the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign\ncurrencies, the translation of these foreign currency-denominated transactions will result in reduced revenues, operating expenses, net income, and cash flows from our\ninternational operations. Similarly, our revenues, operating expenses, net income, and cash flows will increase for our international operations if the U.S. dollar\nweakens against foreign currencies. Since we have significant international sales, but incur the majority of our costs in the United States, the impact of foreign currency\nfluctuations, particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, may have an asymmetric and disproportional impact on our business. We monitor currency volatility\nthroughout the year.\nTo mitigate our foreign currency risk resulting from our foreign currency-denominated monetary assets, liabilities, and earnings and our foreign currency risk\nrelated to functional currency-equivalent cash flows resulting from our intercompany transactions, we periodically enter into currency derivative contracts, principally\nforward contracts. These forward contracts generally have a maturity of less than one year. The counterparties for our currency derivative contracts are large and\nreputable commercial or investment banks.\nThe fair values of our foreign currency contracts are estimated based on the prevailing exchange rates of the various hedged currencies as of the end of the period.\nWe do not hold or purchase any foreign currency forward contracts for trading or speculative purposes.\nFor a detailed discussion of our accounting policies for our foreign currency forward contracts, see Note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements\nincluded in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nForeign Currency Forward Contracts Designated as Hedges (“Cash Flow Hedges”)\nThe total gross notional amounts and fair values of our Cash Flow Hedges are as follows (amounts in millions):\n \nAs of December 31, 2019\n \nAs of December 31, 2018\n \nNotional amount\nFair value gain (loss)\n \nNotional amount\nFair value gain (loss)\nForeign Currency:\n \n \n \n \n \nBuy USD, Sell Euro\n$\n350\n$\n(2",

Our\ninvestment portfolio consists primarily of money market funds and government securities with high credit quality and short average maturities. Because short-term\nsecurities mature relatively quickly and must be reinvested at the then-current market rates, interest income on a portfolio consisting of cash, cash equivalents, or short-\nterm securities is more subject to market fluctuations than a portfolio of longer-term securities. Conversely, the fair value of such a portfolio is less sensitive to market\nfluctuations than a portfolio of longer-term securities. At December 31, 2019, our $5.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents was comprised primarily of money market\nfunds.\nThe Company has determined that, based on the composition of our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2019, there was no material interest rate risk\n",

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on\ncriteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of\nDecember 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019 in conformity with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal\ncontrol over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nChanges in Accounting Principles\n \nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for leases in 2019 and the manner in\nwhich it accounts for revenues from contracts with customers in 2018. \nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for\nits assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nappearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over\nfinancial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB)\nand are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.

Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence\nregarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant\nestimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial\nreporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating\nthe design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.

A company’s internal control over financial\nreporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and\ndispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of\nmanagement and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or\ndisposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the\npolicies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated\nor required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii)\ninvolve",

When determining the estimated service\nperiod for players of the Company’s games, management considers a variety of data points including the weighted-average number of days between the players’ first\nand last days played online, the average total hours played, the average number of days in which the player activity stabilizes, and the weighted-average number of\ndays between players’ first purchase date and last date played online. Management also considers known online trends, the service period of their previously released\ngames, and the service period of their competitors’ games that are similar in nature, to the extent they are publicly available. Determining the estimated service period\nis subjective and requires management’s judgment.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition - determination of the service period for the online\nfunctionality is a critical audit matter are there was significant judgment by management when determining the service period. This in turn led to a high degree of\nauditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and in evaluating audit evidence relating to the data used in developing the service period\nassumption, including the player data assessed by management for historical or comparable titles to determine the weighted-average number of days between players'\nfirst purchase date and last date played online, as well as qualitative factors utilized by management, such as analysis of competitor and industry information.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated\nfinancial statements.

Such fair value was determined based on management’s expectations of future cash flows, long-term\ngrowth rates, and discount rates. The Company recorded a one-time benefit of $230 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2019 for the recognition of a $1.1\nbillion deferred tax asset in the U.K. related to the amortizable tax basis in the transferred intellectual property, net of uncertain tax positions and valuation allowance,\npartially offset by a related $920 million deferred tax liability for U.S. taxes on foreign earnings.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of transferred intellectual property rights that give rise to\ndeferred tax assets is a critical audit matter are there was significant judgment by management in developing the fair value of the intangible assets transferred, which is\nused as the basis for the recording of the deferred tax assets. This led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures to evaluate the\nestimates and assumptions, including, future cash flows, long-term growth rates, and discount rates. In addition, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with\nspecialized skill and knowledge to assist in performing these procedures and evaluating the audit evidence obtained.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated\nfinancial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the valuation of the intangible assets transferred. These procedures also\nincluded, among others, testing management’s process for developing the fair value of the intangible assets transferred; evaluating the appropriateness of the\ndiscounted cash flow model; testing the completeness, accuracy, and relevance of underlying data used in the model; and evaluating the significant assumptions used\nby management, including, future cash flows, long-term growth rates, and discount rates. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the\nevaluation of the Company’s discounted cash flow model and certain significant assumptions, including discount rates.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nLos Angeles, California\nFebruary",

As a result of the agreement to terminate the relationship, the\nCompany recognized revenues of $164 million and GAAP operating income of $91 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Activision no longer has any\nmaterial rights or obligations related to the Destiny franchise.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Consolidation and Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts and operations of the Company. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been\neliminated. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America\n(“U.S. GAAP”). The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that\naffect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions.\nCertain reclassifications have been made to prior-year amounts to conform to the current period presentation.\nThe Company considers events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date, but before the financial statements are issued, for additional evidence\nrelative to certain estimates or to identify matters that require additional disclosures.\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2019, we identified an error principally related to the initial recognition of income taxes for global intangible low-taxed\nincome (“GILTI”) of foreign subsidiaries which should have been recorded in the three months and year ended December 31, 2018. Income tax expense for the three\nmonths and year ended December 31, 2018 should have been reduced by $35 million. This amount is not material to the consolidated financial statements for the year\nended December 31, 2018, and we have revised our 2018 consolidated financial statements and impacted footnotes in this Form 10-K to reflect this correction.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nWe consider all money market funds and highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be “Cash and cash\nequivalents.”\nInvestment Securities\nInvestments in debt securities designated as available-for-sale are carried at fair value, which is based on quoted market prices for such securities, if available, or\nis estimated on the basis of quoted market prices of financial instruments with similar characteristics. Unrealized gains and losses on the Company’s available-for-sale\ndebt securities are excluded from earnings and are reported as a component of “Other comprehensive income (loss).”\nF-10\n\n\nTable of Contents\nACTIVISION BLIZZARD, INC.

Our investments in U.S. treasuries, government agency securities, and corporate\nbonds, if any, are carried at fair value, which is based on quoted market prices for such securities, if available, or is estimated on the basis of quoted market prices of\nfinancial instruments with similar characteristics.\nThe Company transacts business in various foreign currencies and has significant international sales and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, subjecting\nus to foreign currency risk. To mitigate our foreign currency risk resulting from our foreign currency-denominated monetary assets, liabilities, earnings and our foreign\ncurrency risk related to functional currency-equivalent cash flows resulting from our intercompany transactions, we periodically enter into currency derivative\ncontracts, principally forward contracts. These forward contracts generally have a maturity of less than one year. The counterparties for our currency derivative\ncontracts are large and reputable commercial or investment banks.\nWe assess the nature of these derivatives under Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 815 to\ndetermine whether such derivatives should be designated as hedging instruments. The fair value of foreign currency contracts are estimated based on the prevailing\nexchange rates of the various hedged currencies as of the end of the period. We report the fair value of these contracts within “Other current assets,” “Accrued expense\nand other liabilities,” “Other assets,” or “Other liabilities,” as applicable, in our consolidated balance sheets.\nWe do not hold or purchase any foreign currency forward contracts for trading or speculative purposes.\nFor foreign currency forward contracts w",

The\nCompany records the changes in the estimated fair value of these derivatives in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” and subsequently reclassifies the related\namount of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings within “General and administrative” or “Net revenues” when the hedged item impacts earnings,\nconsistent with the nature and timing of the underlying transactions.

We measure hedge ineffectiveness, if any, and if it is determined that a\nderivative has ceased to be a highly effective hedge, the Company will discontinue hedge accounting for the derivative.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nOur concentration of credit risk relates to depositors holding the Company’s cash and cash equivalents and customers with significant accounts receivable\nbalances.\nOur cash and cash equivalents are invested primarily in money market funds consisting of short-term, high-quality debt instruments issued by governments and\ngovernmental organizations, financial institutions and industrial companies.\nF-11\n\n\nTable of Contents\nACTIVISION BLIZZARD, INC.

Inventories are relieved on a weighted-average cost method.\nWe regularly review inventory quantities on-hand and in the retail channels and will write down inventory on-hand based on excess or obsolete inventories,\ndetermined primarily by future anticipated demand for our products. Inventory write-downs are measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and net\nrealizable value, based upon assumptions about future demand, which are inherently difficult to assess and dependent on market conditions. At the point of a loss\nrecognition, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in\nthat newly established basis.\nSoftware Development Costs and Intellectual Property Licenses\nSoftware development costs include payments made to independent software developers under development agreements, as well as direct costs incurred for\ninternally developed products. Software development costs are capitalized once technological feasibility of a product is established and such costs are determined to be\nrecoverable. Technological feasibility of a product requires both technical design documentation and game design documentation, or the completed and tested product\ndesign and a working model. Significant management judgments and estimates are utilized in the assessment of when technological feasibility is established and the\nevaluation is performed on a product-by-product basis. For products where proven technology exists, this may occur early in the development cycle. Software\ndevelopment costs related to online hosted revenue arrangements are capitalized after the preliminary project phase is complete and it is probable that the project will\nbe completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended. Prior to a product’s release, if and when we believe capitalized costs are not recoverable,\nwe expense the amounts as part of “Cost of revenues—software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses.” Capitalized costs for products that are\ncanceled or are expected to be abandoned are charged to “Product development” in the period of cancellation. Amounts related to software development which are not\ncapitalized are charged immediately to “Product development.”\nCommencing upon a product’s release, capitalized software development costs are amortized to “Cost of revenues—software royalties, amortization, and\nintellectual property licenses” based on the ratio of current re",

Depending upon the agreement with the rights holder, we may obtain the\nright to use the intellectual property in multiple products or for a single product. Prior to a product’s release, if and when we believe capitalized costs are not\nrecoverable, we expense the amounts as part of “Cost of revenues—software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses.” Capitalized intellectual\nproperty costs for products that are canceled or are expected to be abandoned are charged to “Product development” in the period of cancellation.\nCommencing upon a product’s release, capitalized intellectual property license costs are amortized to “Cost of revenues—software royalties, amortization, and\nintellectual property licenses” based on the ratio of current revenues for the specific product to total projected revenues for all products in which the licensed property\nwill be utilized. As intellectual property license contracts may extend for multiple years and can be used in multiple products to be released over a period beyond one\nyear, the amortization of capitalized intellectual property license costs relating to such contracts may extend beyond one year.\nWe evaluate the future recoverability of capitalized software development costs and intellectual property licenses on a quarterly basis. For products that have\nbeen released in prior periods, the primary evaluation criterion is the actual performance of the title to which the costs relate. For products that are scheduled to be\nreleased in future periods, recoverability is evaluated based on the expected performance of the specific products to which the costs relate or in which the licensed\ntrademark or copyright is to be used. Criteria used to evaluate expected product performance include: historical performance of comparable products developed with\ncomparable technology; market performance of comparable titles; orders for the product prior to its release; general market conditions; and, for any sequel product,\nestimated performance based on the performance of the product on which the sequel is based. Further, as many of our capitalized intellectual property licenses extend\nfor multiple products over multiple years, we also assess the recoverability of capitalized intellectual property license costs based on certain qualitative factors, such as\nthe success of other products utilizing the intellectual property and the rights holder’s continued promotion and ",

In evaluating the recoverability of capitalized\ncosts, the assessment of expected product performance utilizes forecasted sales amounts and estimates of additional costs to be incurred.

Material differences may result in the amount and timing of expenses for any period if\nmatters resolve in a manner that is inconsistent with management’s expectations.\nAssets Recognized from Costs to Obtain a Contract with a Customer\nWe apply the practical expedient to expense, as incurred, costs to obtain a contract with a customer when the amortization period would have been one year or\nless for certain similar contracts in which commissions are paid to internal personnel or third parties.

The new standard replaced all current U.S. GAAP guidance on this topic.\nThe new standard, among other things, requires a lessee to classify a lease as either an operating or financing lease, and to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use\n(“ROU”) asset for its leases. On January 1, 2019, we adopted the new lease accounting standard. This is reflected in our significant accounting policy disclosure for\nleases below.

In certain of our lease arrangements, primarily those related to our data center\narrangements, judgment is required in determining if a contract contains a lease. For these arrangements, there is judgment in evaluating if the arrangement provides us\nwith an asset that is physically distinct, or that represents substantially all of the capacity of the asset, and if we have the right to direct the use of the asset. Lease assets\nand liabilities are recognized based on the present value of future lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date. Included in the lease liability are\nfuture lease payments that are fixed, in-substance fixed, or are payments based on an index or rate known at the commencement date of the lease. Variable lease\npayments are recognized as lease expenses as incurred, and generally relate to variable payments made based on the level of services provided by the landlords of our\nleases. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made prior to commencement, initial direct costs incurred, and lease incentives received. As\nmost of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we generally use our incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of future payments. The\nincremental borrowing rate represents the rate required to borrow funds over a similar term to purchase the leased asset, and is based on the information available at the\ncommencement date of the lease. For leased assets with similar lease terms and asset type we applied a portfolio approach in determining a single incremental\nborrowing rate to apply to the leased assets.\nIn determining our lease liability, the lease term includes options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such option.\nFor operating leases, the lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

In such instances, we typically have two performance obligations: (1) a license to the game software that is accessible without an\nInternet connection (predominantly the offline single player campaign or game mode) and (2) ongoing activities associated with the online components of the game,\nsuch as content updates, hosting of online content and gameplay, and online matchmaking (the “online functionality”). The online functionality generally operates to\nsupport the additional features and functionalities of the game that are only available online, not the offline license. This evaluation is performed for each software\nproduct or product add-on, including downloadable content. When we determine that our software products contain a license of intellectual property (i.e., the offline\nsoftware license) that is separate and distinct from the online functionality, we consider market conditions and other observable inputs to estimate the standalone selling\nprice for the performance obligations, since we do not generally sell the software license on a standalone basis.

For those assets that do not meet the threshold of “more likely than not” that\nthey will be realized in the future, a valuation allowance is recorded.\nWe report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We recognize interest and\npenalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in “Income tax expense.”\nOn December 22, 2017, tax reform legislation known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “U.S. Tax Reform Act”) was enacted in the United States. The U.S. Tax\nReform Act, among other things, reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018 and implemented a modified territorial tax system\nthat imposed a one-time tax on deemed repatriated earni",

SAB 118 enabled companies to record a provisional amount for the effects of the U.S. Tax Reform Act based on a reasonable\nestimate, subject to adjustment during a measurement period of up to one year, until accounting is complete. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we completed our analysis to\ndetermine the effects of the U.S. Tax Reform Act. As a result, we made an election to record deferred U.S. taxes with respect to earnings of our foreign subsidiaries\nsubject to GILTI.\nExcess tax benefits and tax deficiencies from share-based payments are recorded as an income tax expense or benefit in the consolidated statement of operations.\nThe tax effects of exercised or vested equity awards are treated as discrete items in the reporting period in which they occur.\nForeign Currency Translation\nAll assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries who have a functional currency other than U.S. dollars are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in\neffect at the balance sheet date, and revenue and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the period. The resulting translation adjustments are reflected\nas a component of “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” in shareholders’ equity.\nF-21\n\n\nTable of Contents\nACTIVISION BLIZZARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nEarnings (Loss) Per Common Share\n“Basic (loss) earnings per common share” is computed by dividing income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common\nshares outstanding for the periods presented. “Diluted earnings (loss) per common share” is computed by dividing income (loss) available to common shareholders by\nthe weighted-average number of common shares outstanding, increased by the weighted-average number of common stock equivalents. Common stock equivalents are\ncalculated using the treasury stock method and represent incremental shares issuable upon exercise of our outstanding options. However, potential common shares are\nnot included in the denominator of the diluted earnings (loss) per common share calculation when inclusion of such shares would be anti-dilutive, such as in a period in\nwhich a net loss is recorded.\nShare-Based Payments\nWe account for share-based payments in accordance with ASC Subtopic 718-10. Share-based compensation expense for a given grant is recognized over the\nrequisite service period (that is, the period for which the employee is being compensated) and is based on the value of share-based payment awards after a reduction for\nestimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and are revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.\nWe generally estimate t",

This estimate is affected by our stock price, as well as assumptions regarding a\nnumber of highly complex and subjective variables, including our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and projected employee stock\noption exercise behaviors.\nWe generally determine the fair value of restricted stock units based on the closing market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant, reduced by\nthe present value of the estimated future dividends during the vesting period. Certain restricted stock units granted to our employees and senior management vest based\non the achievement of pre-established performance or market conditions. For performance-based restricted stock units, each quarter we update our assessment of the\nprobability that the specified performance criteria will be achieved. We amortize the fair values of performance-based restricted stock units over the requisite service\nperiod, adjusting for estimated forfeitures for each separately vesting tranche of the award. For market-based restricted stock units, we estimate the fair value at the date\nof grant using a Monte Carlo valuation methodology and amortize those fair values over the requisite service period, adjusting for estimated forfeitures for each\nseparately vesting tranche of the award. The Monte Carlo methodology that we use to estimate the fair value of market-based restricted stock units at the date of grant\nincorporates into the valuation the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied. Provided that the requisite service is rendered, the total fair value of the\nmarket-based restricted stock units at the date of grant must be recognized as compensation expense even if the market condition is not achieved. However, the number\nof shares that ultimately vest can vary significantly with the performance of the specified market criteria.\nFor share-based compensation grants that are liability classified, if any, we update our grant date valuation at each reporting period and recognize a cumulative\ncatch-up adjustment for changes in the value related to the requisite service already rendered.\nLoss Contingencies\nASC Topic 450 governs the disclosure of loss contingencies and accrual of loss contingencies in respect of litigation and other claims. We record an accrual for a\npotential loss when it is probable that a loss will occur and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. When the reasonable estimate of the potential loss is\nwithin a range of amounts, the minimum of the range of potential loss is accrued, unless a higher amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount\nwithin the range. Moreover, even if an accrual is not required, we provide additional disclosure related to litigation and other claims when it is reasonably possible (i.e.,\nmore than remote) that the outcomes of such litigation and other claims include potentia",

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nRecently adopted accounting pronouncements\nLeases\nAs noted in Note 2 above, we adopted the new lease accounting standard effective January 1, 2019. We elected to apply the optional adoption method, which uses\nthe effective date as the initial date of application on transition with no retrospective adjustments to prior periods. Additionally, we elected to apply the package of\ntransition practical expedients which permitted us to, among other things, (1) not reassess if existing contracts contained leases under the new lease accounting\nstandard, and (2) carry forward our historical lease classifications.\nThe impact from the adoption of the new lease accounting standard to our consolidated balance sheet at January 1, 2019, was as follows (amounts in millions):\nConsolidated Balance Sheet:\nBalance at December 31,\n2018\n \nAdjustments due to\nadoption of new lease\naccounting standard\n \nBalance at January 1,\n2019\nAssets\n \n  \n  \n  Other current assets\n$\n539\n $\n(8)  $\n531\nOther assets\n482\n \n252  \n734\nLiabilities\n \n  \n  \nAccrued expenses and other liabilities\n$\n896\n $\n54  $\n950\nOther liabilities\n1,167\n \n190  \n1,357\nThe adoption of this standard did not have an impact on our consolidated statement of operations or consolidated statements of cash flows.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nGoodwill\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued new guidance that eliminates Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Instead, if an entity forgoes a Step 0 test, that entity\nwill be required to perform its annual or interim goodwill impairment test by (1) comparing the fair value of a reporting unit, as determined in Step 1 from the goodwill\nimpairment test, with its carrying amount and (2) recognizing an impairment charge, if any, for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s\nfair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019,\nand should be applied prospectively. Early adoption is permitted. The effect of adoption should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. This\nstandard is effective for us beginning with the first quarter of 2020 and we do not expect it to have an impact on our financial statements and related disclosures upon\nadoption.\nCloud Computing Arrangements\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued new guidance related to a customer’s accounting for implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement (i.e.,\nhosting arrangement) that is a service contract. The new guidance requires customers to capitalize implementation costs for these arrangements by applying the same\ncriteria that are utilized for existing internal-use software guidance.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nFinancial Instruments - Credit Losses\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to accounting for credit losses on financial instruments. The update replaces the existing incurred loss\nimpairment model under current GAAP with a methodology that reflects a current expected credit losses model which requires the use of historical and forward–\nlooking information to calculate credit loss estimates. It also eliminates the concept of other-than-temporary impairment and requires credit losses related to available-\nfor-sale debt securities to be recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than as a reduction in the amortized cost basis of the securities. These changes will\ngenerally result in earlier recognition of credit losses. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and will be applied on a\nmodified retrospective basis, with the cumulative effect of adoption recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings. This standard is effective for us beginning with the\nfirst quarter of 2020 and we do not expect it to have a material impact on our financial statements and related disclosures upon adoption.\nSimplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued new guidance which is intended to simplify various aspects to accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions\nto the general principles in Topic 740 for recognizing deferred taxes for investments, performing an intraperiod allocation and calculating income taxes in interim\nperiods. The amendment also clarifies and amends certain areas of existing guidance to reduce complexity and improve consistency in application of Topic 740. The\nnew standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in any interim period for which financial\nstatements have not yet been issued. Generally the topics must be applied prospectively upon adoption, with the exception of certain topics which are required to be\napplied on a retrospective or modified retrospective basis. We are evaluating the impact, if any, of adopting this new accounting guidance on our financial statements.\n4. Cash and Cash Equivalents\nThe followin",

LIBOR will be\nsubject to a floor of 0% and base rate will be subject to an effective floor of 1.00%.  The applicable interest margin for borrowings under the Revolver will range from\n0.875% to 1.375% for LIBOR borrowings and from 0% to 0.375% for base rate borrowings and will be determined by reference to a pricing grid based on the\nCompany’s credit ratings.

Share-Based Payments\nActivision Blizzard Equity Incentive Plans\nOn June 5, 2014, the Activision Blizzard, Inc. 2014 Incentive Plan (the “2014 Plan”) became effective. Under the 2014 Plan, the Compensation Committee of our\nBoard of Directors is authorized to provide share-based compensation in the form of stock options, share appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units,\nperformance shares, and other performance- or value-based awards structured by the Compensation Committee within parameters set forth in the 2014 Plan. As of the\neffective date of the 2014 Plan, we had ceased making awards under our prior equity incentive plans (collectively, the “Prior Plans”), although such plans remain in\neffect to the extent that they cont",

The majority of our options have time-based vesting schedules, generally vesting annually over a period of three\nyears to five years, and expire 10 years from the grant date. In addition, under the terms of the 2014 Plan, the exercise price for the options must be equal to or greater\nthan the closing price per share of our common stock on the date the award is granted, as reported on Nasdaq. Restricted stock units have time-based vesting schedules,\ngenerally vesting in their entirety on an anniversary of the date of grant, or vest annually over a period of three years to five years, and may also be contingent on the\nachievement of specified performance measures.\nAs of the date it was approved by our shareholders, there were 46 million shares available for issuance under the 2014 Plan. The number of shares of our\ncommon stock reserved for issuance under the 2014 Plan has been, and may be further, increased from time to time by: (1) the number of shares relating to awards\noutstanding under any Prior Plan that: (i) expire, or are forfeited, terminated or canceled, without the issuance of shares; (ii) are settled in cash in lieu of shares; or\n(iii) are exchanged, prior to the issuance of shares of our common stock, for awards not involving our common stock; (2) if the exercise price of any option outstanding\nunder any Prior Plans is, or the tax withholding requirements with respect to any award outstanding under any Prior Plans are, satisfied by withholding shares\notherwise then deliverable in respect of the award or the actual or constructive transfer to the Company of shares already owned, the number of shares equal to the\nwithheld or transferred shares; and (3) if a share appreciation right is exercised and settled in shares, a number of shares equal to the difference between the total\nnumber of shares with respect to which the award is exercised and the number of shares actually issued or transferred. As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately\n24 million shares of our common stock reserved for future issuance under the 2014 Plan. Shares issued in connection with awards made under the 2014 Plan are\ngenerally issued as new stock issuances.\nFair Value Valuation Assumptions\nValuation of Stock Options\nThe fair value of stock options granted are principally estimated using a binomial-lattice model. The inputs in our binomial-lattice model include expected stock\nprice volatility, risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, contractual term, and vesting schedule, as well as measures of employees’ cancellations, exercise, and post-\nvesting termination behavior. Statistical methods are used to estimate employee termination rates.\nThe following table presents the weighted-average assumptions, weighted avera",

The exercise multiple is based on historical employee exercise behaviors.\nVolatility\nTo estimate volatility for the binomial-lattice model, we consider the implied volatility of exchange-traded options on our stock to estimate short-term volatility,\nthe historical volatility of our common shares during the option’s contractual term to estimate long-term volatility, and a statistical model to estimate the transition from\nshort-term volatility to long-term volatility.\nRisk-free interest rate\nAs is the case for volatility, the risk-free interest rate is assumed to change during the option’s contractual term. The risk-free interest rate, which is based on U.S.\nTreasury yield curves, reflects the expected movement in the interest rate from one time period to the next (“forward rate”).\nDividend yield\nThe expected dividend yield assumption is based on our historical and expected future amount of dividend payouts.\nShare-based compensation expense recognized is based on awards ultimately expected to vest and therefore has been reduced for estimated forfeitures.\nForfeitures are estimated at the time of grant based on historical experience and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those\nestimates.\nF-44\n\n\nTable of Contents\nACTIVISION BLIZZARD, INC.

The transfer did not result in a taxable gain; however, our U.K. subsidiary received a step-up in tax basis based on the fair value of\nthe transferred intellectual property rights. Such fair value was determined based on our expectations of future cash flows, long-term growth rates, and discount rates.\nWe recorded a one-time benefit of $230 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2019 for the recognition of a $1.1 billion deferred tax asset in the U.K. related to the\namortizable tax basis in the transferred intellectual property, net of uncertain tax positions and valuation allowance, partially offset by a related $920 million deferred\ntax liability for U.S. taxes on foreign earnings. The U.K. amortizable tax basis will be recovered over a period of three years to 25 years and the related deferred tax\nasset was measured using the enacted U.K. corporate tax rates for the years in which the amortization will be realized. We recorded a valuation allowance of $110\nmillion for the portion of the deferred tax asset for which it is more-likely-than-not that a benefit will not be realized based on objective evidence available as of\nDecember 31, 2019. We will update the measurement and realizability analysis going forward and record the impact from any change in determination in the period of\nthe change.    \nOn June 27, 2018, we entered into a closing agreement with the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) to resolve certain intercompany transfer pricing arrangements\nfor tax periods starting in 2009 (the “Closing Agreement”).

We\nanticipate resolving King’s transfer pricing for both pre- and post-acquisition tax years through a collaborative multilateral process with the tax authorities in the\nrelevant jurisdictions, which include the U.K. and Sweden. While the outcome of this process remains uncertain, it could result in an agreement that changes the\nallocation of profits and losses between these and other relevant jurisdictions or a failure to reach an agreement that results in unilateral adjustments to the amount and\ntiming of taxable income in the jurisdictions in which King operates.\nIn December 2018, we received a decision from the Swedish Tax Agency (the “STA”) informing us of an audit assessment of a Swedish subsidiary of King for\nthe 2016 tax year (the “Initial Decision”).

On June 17, 2019, we received a reassessment from the STA (the\n“Reassessment”) which changed the Initial Decision based on a revision of the transfer pricing approach reflected in King’s 2016 Swedish tax return and removal of the\nalleged intercompany asset transfer that was the basis of the Initial Decision. The STA also, at the same time, reassessed the 2017 tax year on the same transfer pricing\nbasis as 2016. The transfer pricing approach reflected in the Reassessment for both 2016 and 2017 remains subject to further review by taxing authorities in other\njurisdictions. In July 2019, the Company made a payment to the STA for the Reassessment for the 2016 and 2017 tax years, which did not result in a significant impact\nto our consolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2017, we received a Notice of Reassessment from the French Tax Authority (the “FTA”) related to transfer pricing for intercompany transactions\ninvolving one of our French subsidiaries for the 2011 through 2013 tax years. The total assessment, including penalties and interest, was approximately €571 million\n(approximately $638 million). In December 2019, the Company reached a settlement with the FTA for the 2011 through 2018 tax years, resulting in the recognition of\n$54 million of tax expense in ",

The number of authorized shares of any class or\nclasses of our capital stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a\nmajority in voting power of our outstanding capital stock entitled to vote thereon, irrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the Delaware General\nCorporation Law (the “DGCL”). We may not authorize the issuance of any class, or series thereof, of nonvoting equity shares. Our common stock is registered under\nSection 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).\nVoting Rights\nHolders of our common stock are entitled to one vote per share on all matters voted on by the stockholders, including in connection with the election of\ndirectors, as provided by law.

In\ngeneral, a “business combination” includes, among other things, a merger or consolidation involving us and the “interested stockholder” and the sale of more than 10%\nof our assets. In general, an “interested stockholder” is any entity or person beneficially owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock and any entity or person\naffiliated with or controlling or controlled by such entity or person.\nA Delaware corporation may “opt out” of these provisions with an express provision in its original certificate of incorporation or an express provision in its\ncertificate of incorporation or bylaws resulting from a stockholders’ amendment approved by at least a majority of the outstanding voting shares.

      "output": "### Analysis\n\n1. **Information Gathered:**\n   - **Revenue Data:** We have successfully extracted total revenue figures for FY2017, FY2018, and FY2019 from multiple chunks. The consistent figures across several chunks are:\n     - FY2017: \\$7,017 million\n     - FY2018: \\$7,500 million\n     - FY2019: \\$6,489 million\n   - **Capex Data:** We have extracted capital expenditures (capex) for FY2018 and FY2019 from a few chunks:\n     - FY2018: \\$131 million\n     - FY2019: \\$116 million\n     - FY2017: \\$155 million (from one chunk)\n\n2. **Sufficiency of Information:**\n   - We have sufficient data to calculate the capex as a percentage of revenue for each fiscal year from 2017 to 2019. The revenue and capex figures for these years are consistent across multiple chunks, providing confidence in their accuracy.\n\n3. **Calculation:**\n   - Calculate capex as a percentage of revenue for each year:\n     - FY2017: \\((155 / 7,017) \\times 100\\)\n     - FY2018: \\((131 / 7,500) \\times 100\\)\n     - FY2019: \\((116 / 6,489) \\times 100\\)\n   - Compute the average of these percentages to get the 3-year average.\n\n4. **Conflicting Answers:**\n   - There are no significant conflicts in the extracted data for revenue and capex. The figures are consistent across the relevant chunks.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - We can proceed to calculate the 3-year average of capex as a percentage of revenue using the extracted data. The calculations will provide the final answer to the question."
