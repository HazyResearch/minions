  "question": "Does Boeing have an improving gross margin profile as of FY2022? If gross margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then state that and explain why.",
  "predicted_answer": "Boeing has an improving gross margin profile as of FY2022, with gross margin figures increasing from 8.5% in FY2021 to 10.3% in FY2022. However, due to the nature of Boeing's business, gross margin may not be the most useful metric for assessing financial health. Factors such as long-term contracts, project-based revenue, and specific program margins can significantly impact the gross margin, making other metrics like operating margin or cash flow more relevant.",
  "ground_truth": [
    "Yes. Boeing has an improving gross margin profile as of FY2022. Gross profit improved from $3,017 million in FY2021 to $3,502 million in FY2022. Gross margin % improved from 4.8% in FY2021 to 5.3% in FY2022."

  "correctness_reasoning": "The predicted answer incorrectly states the gross margin figures, which are outside the 10% tolerance range of the ground truth. The ground truth states a gross margin improvement from 4.8% to 5.3%, while the predicted answer states an increase from 8.5% to 10.3%. Although the predicted answer provides additional context about the relevance of gross margin for Boeing, the numerical discrepancy makes the answer incorrect."
