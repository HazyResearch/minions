  "question": "Does Boeing have an improving gross margin profile as of FY2022? If gross margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then state that and explain why.",
  "predicted_answer": "The document does not provide explicit gross margin figures for Boeing for FY2022. However, it suggests that gross margin might not be a useful metric due to the complexities of Boeing's operations, such as fixed-price contracts and development programs. Alternative metrics like operating margins, reach-forward losses, and cash flows are considered more relevant for evaluating Boeing's financial performance.",
  "ground_truth": [
    "Yes. Boeing has an improving gross margin profile as of FY2022. Gross profit improved from $3,017 million in FY2021 to $3,502 million in FY2022. Gross margin % improved from 4.8% in FY2021 to 5.3% in FY2022."

The ground truth states that Boeing has an improving gross margin profile as of FY2022, with specific figures provided. The predicted answer suggests that gross margin might not be a useful metric for Boeing and does not confirm the improvement, which contradicts the ground truth."
