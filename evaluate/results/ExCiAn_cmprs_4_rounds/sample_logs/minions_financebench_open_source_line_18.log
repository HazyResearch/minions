--- Question ---
Based on the information provided primarily in the statement of financial position and the statement of income, what is AES's FY2022 return on assets (ROA)? ROA is defined as: FY2022 net income / (average total assets between FY2021 and FY2022). Round your answer to two decimal places.

--- Predicted Answer ---
-1.53%

['-0.02']

--- Correctness Evaluation ---
Is correct: False
Confidence: 0.90
Reasoning: The ground truth answer is -0.02, which is equivalent to -2% when expressed as a percentage. The predicted answer is -1.53%, which is outside the 10% tolerance range of -2% (i.e., -1.8% to -2.2%). Therefore, the predicted answer is incorrect.
