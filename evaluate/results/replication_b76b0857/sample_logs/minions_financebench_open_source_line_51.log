--- Question ---
Are Best Buy's gross margins historically consistent (not fluctuating more than roughly 2% each year)? If gross margins are not a relevant metric for a company like this, then please state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
Best Buy's gross margins are not historically consistent, as they fluctuated by more than 2% between 2022 and 2023.

--- Ground Truth ---
['Yes, the margins have been consistent, there has been a minor decline of 1.1% in gross margins between FY2022 and FY2023.']

--- Correctness Evaluation ---
Is correct: False
Confidence: 1.00
Reasoning: The predicted answer states that Best Buy's gross margins fluctuated by more than 2% between 2022 and 2023, which contradicts the ground truth answer that mentions a minor decline of 1.1%. The stance on the consistency of the margins does not match, violating the evaluation rule for yes/no questions.
