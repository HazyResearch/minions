--- Question ---
What drove gross margin change as of the FY2022 for American Express? If gross margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then please state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
Gross margin is not a useful metric for American Express, as the company operates primarily in the financial services sector. Metrics such as net interest margin, return on equity, and operating margin are more relevant for understanding its financial performance. The document analysis did not reveal any direct mentions of gross margin changes, and the focus was on regulatory, compliance, and risk management aspects, as well as employee benefits and compensation plans.

--- Ground Truth ---
['Performance is not measured through gross margin']
