--- Question ---
What is Adobe's year-over-year change in unadjusted operating income from FY2015 to FY2016 (in units of percents and round to one decimal place)? Give a solution to the question by using the income statement.

--- Predicted Answer ---
54.1%

--- Ground Truth ---
['65.4%']

--- Correctness Evaluation ---
Is correct: False
Confidence: 0.90
Reasoning: The ground truth answer is 65.4%, and the predicted answer is 54.1%. Applying a 10% tolerance to the ground truth (65.4%), the acceptable range is 58.86% to 71.94%. The predicted answer of 54.1% falls outside this range, so it is incorrect.
