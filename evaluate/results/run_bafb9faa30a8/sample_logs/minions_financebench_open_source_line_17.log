--- Question ---
Roughly how many times has AES Corporation sold its inventory in FY2022? Calculate inventory turnover ratio for the FY2022; if conventional inventory management is not meaningful for the company then state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
The inventory turnover ratio for AES Corporation in FY2022 cannot be calculated due to missing average inventory data. However, the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) for FY2022 is $10,069 million. Conventional inventory management is not meaningful for AES Corporation because the company is primarily involved in energy generation and distribution, which involves managing fuel and raw materials rather than traditional inventory.

--- Ground Truth ---
['AES has converted inventory 9.5 times in FY 2022.']
