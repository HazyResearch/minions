--- Question ---
Does 3M have a reasonably healthy liquidity profile based on its quick ratio for Q2 of FY2023? If the quick ratio is not relevant to measure liquidity, please state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
Due to inconsistent data on current assets excluding inventory and missing data on current liabilities, we cannot determine if 3M has a reasonably healthy liquidity profile based on its quick ratio for Q2 FY2023.

--- Ground Truth ---
["No. The quick ratio for 3M was 0.96 by Jun'23 close, which needs a bit of an improvement to touch the 1x mark"]
