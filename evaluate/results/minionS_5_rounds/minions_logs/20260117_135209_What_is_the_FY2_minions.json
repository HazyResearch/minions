      "output": "To answer the question about General Mills' FY2019 cash conversion cycle (CCC), focus on extracting specific financial data from the income statement and balance sheet. You need the cost of goods sold (COGS) and revenue figures for FY2019 from the income statement. From the balance sheet, gather the inventory, accounts receivable, and accounts payable figures for both FY2018 and FY2019. Calculate the average values for inventory, accounts receivable, and accounts payable by taking the sum of the FY2018 and FY2019 figures and dividing by two. Additionally, determine the change in inventory by subtracting the FY2018 inventory from the FY2019 inventory. With these figures, you can compute the days inventory outstanding (DIO), days sales outstanding (DSO), and days payable outstanding (DPO) using the provided formulas. Finally, calculate the CCC by summing DIO and DSO, then subtracting DPO, and round your result to two decimal places."

      "prompt": "# Decomposition Round #1\n\nYou (the supervisor) cannot directly read the document(s). Instead, you can assign small, isolated tasks to a less capable worker model that sees only a single chunk of text at a time. Any cross-chunk or multi-document reasoning must be handled by you.\n\n## Your Job: Write Two Python Functions\n\n### FUNCTION #1: `prepare_jobs(context, prev_job_manifests, prev_job_outputs) -> List[JobManifest]`\n- Break the document(s) into chunks (using the provided chunking function, if needed). Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 12 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`. All **multi-chunk integration** or **global reasoning** is your responsibility here.\n- Return one **aggregated string** suitable for further supervisor inspection.\n\n\n\n## Relevant Pydantic Models\n\nThe following models are already in the global scope. **Do NOT redefine or re-import them.**\n\n### JobManifest Model\n```\nclass JobManifest(BaseModel):\n    chunk: str  # the actual text for the chunk of the document\n    task: str  # the actual task instruction for the small model\n    advice: str  # optional, any additional advice on how to perform the task\n\n    chunk_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    task_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    job_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n\n```\n\n### JobOutput Model\n```\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    citation: Optional[str]\n    answer: Optional[str]\n\n```\n\n## Function Signatures\n```\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        context (List[str]): A list of documents.

Competition in our product categories is based on product innovation, product\nquality, price, brand recognition and loyalty, effectiveness of marketing, promotional activity, convenient ordering and delivery to the consumer, and the\nability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences. Our principal strategies for competing in each of our segments include unique consumer insights,\neffective customer relationships, superior product quality, innovative advertising, product promotion, product innovation aligned with consumers’ needs, an\nefficient supply chain, and price. In most product categories, we compete not only with other widely advertised, branded products, but also with regional\nbrands and with generic and private label products that are generally sold at lower prices. Internationally, we compete with both multi-national and local\nmanufacturers, and each country includes a unique group of competitors.\nRaw materials, ingredients, and packaging. The principal raw materials that we use are grains (wheat, oats, and corn), dairy products, sugar, fruits,\nvegetable oils, meats, nuts, vegetables, and other agricultural products.

In addition, we build the equity\nof our brands over time with strong consumer-directed marketing, innovative new products, and effective merchandising. We believe our brand-building\nstrategy is the key to winning and sustaining leading share positions in markets around the globe.\nOur fundamental financial goal is to generate superior returns for our shareholders over the long term. We believe that increases in organic net sales,\nadjusted operating profit, adjusted earnings per share (EPS), free cash flow, and cash return to shareholders are key drivers of financial performance for our\nbusiness.\nOur long-term growth objectives are to consistently deliver:\n \n•\n low single-digit annual growth in organic net sales;\n•\n mid single-digit annual growth in adjusted operating profit;\n•\n high single-digit annual growth in adjusted diluted EPS;\n•\n free cash flow conversion averaging above 95 percent of adjusted net earnings after tax; and\n•\n cash return to shareholders averaging above 90 percent of free cash flow, in",

By focusing on this growth\nframework, we expect to generate financial performance consistent with the long-term growth objectives listed above, which we believe should result in\nlong-term value creation for our shareholders.\nIn fiscal 2019 we executed well and met or exceeded each of our key full-year financial targets, including organic net sales growth and constant-currency\ngrowth in net sales, adjusted operating profit, and adjusted diluted EPS. Relative to fiscal 2018, we improved our net sales performance in U.S. Yogurt and\nour emerging market businesses, we increased our contributions from innovation, we stabilized our distribution trends in the U.S., and we generated greater\nbenefits from net price realization and mix through our Strategic Revenue Management capability. These results were partially offset by challenging\nperformance for U.S. snack bars, leaving our organic net sales growth at the low end of the range outlined in our initial annual targets.\nWe successfully transitioned Blue Buffalo into the General Mills portfolio in fiscal 2019, achieving our goals of double-digit pro forma growth in net sales\nand segment operating profit excluding the impact of purchase accounting. The combination of record-level Holistic Margin Management (HMM) savings,\nincreased benefits from net price realization and mix, and strong cost management drove growth in constant-currency adjusted operating profit and adjusted\ndiluted EPS ahead of our initial targets. Finally, we continued to maintain a disciplined focus on cash, resulting in another year of strong free cash flow\nconversion.\nOur consolidated net sales for fiscal 2019 rose 7 percent to $16.9 billion. On an organic basis, net sales essentially matched year-ago levels. Operating profit\nof $2.5 billion increased 4 percent. Adjusted operating profit of $2.8 billion increased 9 percent and increased 10 percent on a constant-currency\nbasis. Diluted EPS of $2.90 was down 20 percent compared to fiscal 2018 results. Adjusted diluted EPS was up 4 percent to $3.22 per share and increased\n4 percent on a constant-currency basis (See the “Non-GAAP Measures” section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by generally\naccepted accounting principles (GAAP)).\n \n19\n\n\nTable of Contents\nNet cash provided by operations totaled $2.8 billion in fiscal 2019 representing a conv",

The 3.9 percentage point decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate was primarily due\nto the net benefits associated with the TCJA, partially offset by the change in earnings mix by jurisdiction.\nThe TCJA includes provisions affecting our fiscal 2019 effective tax rate, including but not limited to: a reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate on domestic\noperations to 21 percent; a provision that taxes U.S. allocated expenses and certain income from foreign operations (GILTI); a limitation on deductible\ninterest expense; the repeal of the domestic manufacturing deduction; and a limitation on the deductibility of certain executive compensation. In fiscal 2019,\nwe completed our accounting for the tax effects of the TCJA and recorded a benefit of $7 million which included adjustments to the transition tax and the\nmeasurement of our net U.S. deferred tax liability.\nAfter-tax earnings from joint ventures decreased $13 million to $72 million in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018, primarily driven by our $11 million\nafter-tax share of restructuring charges at CPW, and lower net sales and hig",

The $550 million change in current assets and liabilities was primarily driven by a $413 million change in the timing of\naccounts payable, including the impact of longer payment terms implemented in prior fiscal years.

Fair value is measured using discounted\ncash flows or independent appraisals, as appropriate.\nIntangible Assets\nGoodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not subject to amortization and are tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes\nin circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Our estimates of fair value for goodwill impairment testing are determined based on a\ndiscounted cash flow model. We use inputs from our long-range planning process to determine growth rates for sales and profits. We also make estimates of\ndiscount rates, perpetuity growth assumptions, market comparables, and other factors.\nWe evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets, mainly brands, to determine if they are finite or indefinite-lived. Reaching a determination on\nuseful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such\nas the stability of the industry, known technological advances, legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and\nexpected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets.\nIntangible assets that are deemed to have definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis, over their useful lives, generally rang",

An increase in the expected term by 1 year, leaving all other assumptions constant, would increase the grant date fair value by 9 percent. If all other\nassumptions are held constant, a one percentage point increase in our fiscal 2019 volatility assumption would increase the grant date fair value of our fiscal\n2019 option awards by 8 percent.\nTo the extent that actual outcomes differ from our assumptions, we are not required to true up grant-date fair value-based expense to final intrinsic values.\nHistorical data has a significant bearing on our forward-looking assumptions. Significant variances between actual and predicted experience could lead to\nprospective revisions in our assumptions, which could then significantly impact the year-over-year comparability of stock-based compensation expense.\n \n35\n\n\nTable of Contents\nAny corporate income tax benefit realized upon exercise or vesting of an award in excess of that previously recognized in earnings (referred to as a windfall\ntax benefit) is presented in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as an operating cash flow. The actual impact on future years’ cash flows will depend,\nin part, on the volume of employee stock option exercises during a particular year and the relationship between the exercise-date market value of the\nunderlying stock and the original grant-date fair value previously determined for financial reporting purposes.\nRealized windfall tax benefits and shortfall tax deficiencies related to the exercise or vesting of stock-based awards are recognized in the Consolidated\nStatement of Earnings. Because employee stock option exercise behavior is not within our control, it is possible that significantly different reported results\ncould occur if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail.\nIncome Taxes\nWe apply a more-likely-than-not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions.

We also\nsponsor plans that provide health care benefits to many of our retirees in the United States, Canada, and Brazil. Under certain circumstances, we also\nprovide accruable benefits, primarily severance, to former and inactive employees in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Please see Note 13 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for a description of our defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and\npostemployment benefit plans.\nWe recognize benefits provided during retirement or following employment over the plan participants’ active working lives. Accordingly, we make various\nassumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement of our obligations. Assumptions that require significant\nmanagement judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our net periodic benefit expense or income and accumulated benefit obligations\ninclude the long-term rates of return on plan assets, the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our benefit plans, and health care cost trend rates.\nExpected Rate of Return on Plan Assets\nOur expected rate of return on plan assets is determined by our asset allocation, our historical long-term investment performance, our estimate of future\nlong-term returns by asset class (using input from our actuaries, investment services, and investment managers), and long-term inflation assumptions. We\nreview this assumption annually for each plan; however, our annual investment performance for one particular year does not, by itself, significantly\ninfluence our evaluation.\nOur historical investment returns (compound annual growth rates) for our United States defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets\nwere 6.6 percent, 6.6 percent, 10.3 percent, 8.4 percent, and 7.9 percent for the 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 year periods ended May 26, 2019.\nOn a weighted-average basis, the expected rate of return for all defined benefit plans was 7.25 percent for fiscal 2019, 7.88 percent for fiscal 2018, and\n8.17 percent for fiscal 2017. For fiscal 2020, we lowered our weighted-average expected rate of return on plan assets for our principal defined benefit\npension and other postretirement plans in the United States to 7.0 percent due to asset allocation changes and expected asset returns.\nLowering the expected long-term rate of return on assets by 100 basis points would increase our net pension and postretirement e",

Our outside actuaries perform these calculations as part of our determination of annual expense\nor income.\nDiscount Rates\nWe estimate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic benefit expense for our United States and most of our international defined benefit\npension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans utilizing a full yield curve approach by applying the specific spot rates along the\nyield curve used to determine the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. Our discount rate assumptions are determined annually as of\nMay 31 for our defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan obligations. We work with our outside actuaries to\ndetermine the timing and amount of expected future cash outflows to plan participants and, using the Aa Above Median corporate bond yield, to develop a\nforward interest rate curve, including a margin to that index based on our credit risk.

The new standard amends the hedge\naccounting recognition and presentation requirements to better align an entity’s risk management activities and financial reporting. The new standard also\nsimplifies the application of hedge accounting guidance. The requirements of the new standard are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after\nDecember 15, 2018, and interim periods within those annual periods, which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2020. We do not expect this guidance to have\na material impact on our results of operations or financial position.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued new accounting requirements for accounting, presentation and classification of leases. This will result in certain leases\nbeing capitalized as a right of use asset with a related liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The requirements of the new standard and subsequent\namendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those annual periods, which for us is\nthe first quarter of fiscal 2020. The requirements of the new standard and subsequent amendments allow for either the modified retrospective transition\napproach, which requires application of the guidance in all comparative periods presented, or the cumulative effect adjustment approach, which requires\napplication of the guidance at the adoption date.\nWe are in the process of implementing lease accounting software, developing a centralized business process, and implementing corresponding controls.

A Monte Carlo value-at-risk (VAR) methodology was\nused to quantify the market risk for our exposures. The models assumed normal market conditions and used a 95 percent confidence level.\nThe VAR calculation used historical interest and foreign exchange rates, and commodity and equity prices from the past year to estimate the potential\nvolatility and correlation of these rates in the future. The market data were drawn from the RiskMetrics ™ data set. The calculations are not intended to\nrepresent actual losses in fair value that we expect to incur. Further, since the hedging instrument (the derivative) inversely correlates with the underlying\nexposure, we would expect that any loss or gain in the fair value of our derivatives would be generally offset by an increase or decrease in the fair value of\nthe underlying exposure. The positions included in the calculations were: debt; investments; interest rate swaps; foreign exchange forwards; commodity\nswaps, futures, and options; and equity instruments. The calculations do not include the underlying foreign exchange and commodities or equity-related\npositions that are offset by these market-risk-sensitive instruments.\n \n48\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe table below presents the estimated maximum potential VAR arising from a one-day loss in fair value for our interest rate, foreign currency, commodity,\nand equity market-risk-sensitive instruments outstanding as of May 26, 2019 and May 27, 2018, and the average fair value impact during the year ended\nMay 26, 2019.\n \n \n  \nFair Value Impact\n \nIn Millions\n  \nMay 26, \n2019   \nAverage\nduring\nfiscal 2019   \nMay 27, \n2018 \nInterest rate instruments\n  \n$         74.4   \n$         46.1   \n$         33.2 \nForeign currency instruments\n  \n \n16.8   \n \n19.0   \n \n21.3 \nCommodity instruments\n  \n \n4.1   \n \n2.5   \n \n1.9 \nEquity instruments\n  \n \n2.3   \n \n2.2   \n \n2.0 \n \n \n \n49\n\n\nTable of Contents\nITEM 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nREPORT OF MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES\nThe management of General Mills, Inc. is responsible for the fairness and accuracy of the consolidated financial statements.

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on\nthe Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company\nAccounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S.\nfederal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective\ninternal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial\nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,\nevidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used\nand significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal\ncontrol over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness\nexists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing\nsuch other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.

See Note 2 for\nadditional information.\nChange in Reporting Period\nAs part of a long-term plan to conform the fiscal year ends of all our operations, in fiscal 2017 we changed the reporting period of General Mills Brasil\nAlimentos Ltda (Yoki) within our Asia & Latin America segment from an April fiscal year-end to a May fiscal year-end to match our fiscal calendar.\nAccordingly, in fiscal 2017, our results included 13 months of results from the affected operations. The impact of these changes was not material to our\nconsolidated results of operations. Our General Mills India business and Pet operating segment are on an April fiscal year end.\nNOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nWe consider all investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.\nInventories\nAll inventories in the United States other than grain are valued at the lower of cost, using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method, or market. Grain inventories\nare valued at net realizable value, and all related cash contracts and derivatives are valued at fair value, with all net changes in value recorded in earnings\ncurrently.\nInventories outside of the United States are generally valued at the lower of cost, using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, or net realizable value.\nShipping costs associated with the distribution of finished product to our customers are recorded as cost of sales, and are recognized when the related\nfinished product is shipped to and accepted by the customer.\nLand, Buildings, Equipment, and Depreciation\nLand is recorded at historical cost. Buildings and equipment, including capitalized interest and internal engineering costs, are recorded at cost and\ndepreciated over estimated useful lives, primarily using the straight-line method. Ordinary maintenance and repairs are charged to cost of sales. Buildings\nare usually depreciated over 40 years, and equipment, furniture, and software are usually depreciated over 3 to 10 years. Fully depreciated assets are\nretained in buildings and equipment until disposal. When an item is sold or retired, the accounts are relieved of its cost and related accumulated depreciation\nand the resulting gains and losses, if any, are recognized in earnings. As of May 26, 2019, assets held for sale were insignificant.\nLong-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group)\nmay not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and disposition ",

Asset groups have identifiable cash flows and are largely\n \n58\n\n\nTable of Contents\nindependent of other asset groups. Measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair\nvalue. Fair value is measured using a discounted cash flow model or independent appraisals, as appropriate.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill is not subject to amortization and is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment\nmay have occurred. We perform our annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment test as of the first day of the second quarter of the\nfiscal year. Impairment testing is performed for each of our reporting units. We compare the carrying value of a reporting unit, including goodwill, to the\nfair value of the unit. Carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit, which often requires\nallocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, impairment has occurred. We\nrecognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value up to the total amount of goodwill\nallocated to the reporting unit. Our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model. Growth rates for sales and profits are\ndetermined using inputs from our long-range planning process. We also make estimates of discount rates, perpetuity growth assumptions, market\ncomparables, and other factors.\nWe evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets, mainly brands, to determine if they are finite or indefinite-lived. Reaching a determination on\nuseful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such\nas the stability of the industry, known technological advances, legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and\nexpected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets.\nIntangible assets that are deemed to have definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis, over their useful lives, generally ranging from 4 to 30 years.\nOur indefinite-lived intangible assets, mainly intangible assets primarily associated with the Blue Buffalo , Pillsbury , Totino’s , Yoplait , Old El Paso ,\nProgresso , Annie’s , Häagen-Dazs , and Yoki brands, are also tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate\nthat their carrying value may not be recoverable.

Measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount\nof the asset over its fair value. Fair value is measured using a discounted cash flow model or other similar valuation model, as appropriate.\nInvestments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures\nOur investments in companies over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence are stated at cost plus our share of undistributed earnings or\nlosses. We receive royalty income from certain joint ventures, incur various expenses (primarily research and development), and record the tax impact of\ncertain joint venture operations that are structured as partnerships. In addition, we make advances to our joint ventures in the form of loans or capital\ninvestments. We also sell certain raw materials, semi-finished goods, and finished goods to the joint ventures, generally at market prices.\nIn addition, we assess our investments in our joint ventures if we have reason to believe an impairment may have occurred including, but not limited to, as a\nresult of ongoing operating losses, projected decreases in earnings, increases in the weighted-average cost of capital, or significant business disruptions. The\nsignificant assumptions\n \n59\n\n\nTable of Contents\nused to estimate fair value include revenue growth and profitability, royalty rates, capital spending, depreciation and taxes, foreign currency exchange rates,\nand a discount rate. By their nature, these projections and assumptions are uncertain. If we were to determine the current fair value of our investment was\nless than the carrying value of the investment, then we would assess if the shortfall was of a temporary or permanent nature and write down the investment\nto its fair value if we concluded the impairment is other than temporary.\nRedeemable Interest\nWe have a 51 percent controlling interest in Yoplait SAS, a consolidated entity. Sodiaal International (Sodiaal) holds the remaining 49 percent interest in\nYoplait SAS. Sodiaal has the ability to put all or a portion of its redeemable interest to us at fair value once per year, up to three times before December\n2024. This put option requires us to classify Sodiaal’s interest as a redeemable interest outside of equity on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for as long as\nthe put is exercisable by Sodiaal.

During the second and fourth quarters of fiscal 2019, we adjusted\nthe redeemable interest’s redemption value based on a discounted cash flow model. The significant assumptions used to estimate the redemption value\ninclude projected revenue growth and profitability from our long-range plan, capital spending, depreciation, taxes, foreign currency exchange rates, and a\ndiscount rate.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenues primarily result from contracts with customers, which are generally short-term and have a single performance obligation – the delivery of\nproduct. We recognize revenue for the sale of packaged foods at the point in time when our performance obligation has been satisfied and control of the\nproduct has transferred to our customer, which generally occurs when the shipment is accepted by our customer. Sales include shipping and handling\ncharges billed to the customer and are reported net of variable consideration and consideration payable to our customers, including trade promotion,\nconsumer coupon redemption and other costs, including estimated allowances for returns, unsalable product, and prompt pay discounts. Sales, use, value-\nadded, and other excise taxes are not included in revenue. Trade promotions are recorded using significant judgment of estimated participation and\nperformance levels for offered programs at the time of sale. Differences between estimated expenses and actual costs are recognized as a change in\nmanagement estimate in a subsequent period. We generally do not allow a right of return. However, on a limited case-by-case basis with prior approval, we\nmay allow customers to return product. In limited circumstances, product returned in saleable condition is resold to other customers or outlets. Receivables\nfrom customers generally do not bear interest. Payment terms and collection patterns are short-term, and vary around the world and by channel, and as such,\nwe do not have any significant financing components. Our allowance for doubtful accounts represents our estimate of probable non-payments and credit\nlosses in our existing receivables, as determined based on a review of past due balances and other specific account data. Account balances are written off\nagainst the allowance when we deem the amount is uncollectible. Please see Note 16 for a disaggregation of our revenue into categories that depict how the\nnature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors.

R&D includes expenditures for new product and\nmanufacturing process innovation, and the annual expenditures are comprised primarily of internal salaries, wages, consulting, and supplies attributable to\nR&D activities. Other costs include depreciation and maintenance of research facilities, including assets at facilities that are engaged in pilot plant activities.\nForeign Currency Translation\nFor all significant foreign operations, the functional currency is the local currency. Assets and liabilities of these operations are translated at the period-end\nexchange rates. Income statement accounts are translated using the average exchange rates prevailing during the period. Translation adjustments are\nreflected within accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCI) in stockholders’ equity. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in\nnet earnings for the period, except for gains and losses on investments in subsidiaries for which settlement is not planned for the foreseeable future and\nforeign exchange gains and losses on instruments designated as net investment hedges. These gains and losses are recorded in AOCI.\nDerivative Instruments\nAll derivatives are recognized on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value based on quoted market prices or our estimate of their fair value, and are\nrecorded in either current or noncurrent assets or liabilities based on their maturity. Changes in the fair values of derivatives are recorded in net earnings or\nother comprehensive income, based on whether the instrument is designated and effective as a hedge transaction and, if so, the type of hedge transaction.\nGains or losses on derivative instruments reported in AOCI are reclassified to earnings in the period the hedged item affects earnings. If the underlying\nhedged transaction ceases to exist, any associated amounts reported in AOCI are reclassified to earnings at that time. Any ineffectiveness is recognized in\nearnings in the current period.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe generally measure compensation expense for grants of restricted stock units and performance share units using the value of a share of our stock on the\ndate of grant.

These estimates include our accounting for promotional\nexpenditures, valuation of long-lived assets, intangible assets, redeemable interest, stock-based compensation, income taxes, and defined benefit pension,\nother postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit plans. Actual results could differ from our estimates.\nNew Accounting Standards\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we adopted new accounting requirements related to the presentation of net periodic defined benefit pension expense, net\nperiodic postretirement benefit expense, and net periodic postemployment benefit expense (collectively “net periodic benefit expense”). The new standard\nrequires the service cost component of net periodic benefit expense to be recorded in the same line items as other employee compensation costs within our\nConsolidated Statements of Earnings. Other components of net periodic benefit expense must be presented separately outside of operating profit in our\nConsolidated Statements of Earnings. In addition, the new standard requires that only the service cost component of net periodic benefit expense is eligible\nfor capitalization. The new standard requires retrospective adoption of the presentation of net periodic benefit expense and prospective application of the\ncapitalization of the service cost component. The impact of the adoption of this standard on our results of operations was a decrease to our operating profit\nof $87.9 million, $89.4 million and $74.3 million and a corresponding increase to benefit plan non-service income of $87.9 million, $89.4 million and\n$74.3 million for fiscal 2019, fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively. There were no changes to our reported segment operating profit.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we adopted new accounting requirements for the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers. Under the new\nstandard, we apply a principles-based five step model to recognize revenue upon the transfer of control of promised goods to customers and in an amount\nthat reflects the consideration for which we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods.

To manage these risks, we may enter into various derivative transactions (e.g., futures, options, and swaps) pursuant to our established\npolicies.\nCOMMODITY PRICE RISK\nMany commodities we use in the production and distribution of our products are exposed to market price risks. We utilize derivatives to manage price risk\nfor our principal ingredients and energy costs, including grains (oats, wheat, and corn), oils (principally soybean), dairy products, natural gas, and diesel\nfuel. Our primary objective when entering into these derivative contracts is to achieve certainty with regard to the future price of\n \n70\n\n\nTable of Contents\ncommodities purchased for use in our supply chain. We manage our exposures through a combination of purchase orders, long-term contracts with\nsuppliers, exchange-traded futures and options, and over-the-counter options and swaps. We offset our exposures based on current and projected market\nconditions and generally seek to acquire the inputs at as close to our planned cost as possible.\nWe use derivatives to manage our exposure to changes in commodity prices. We do not perform the assessments required to achieve hedge accounting for\ncommodity derivative positions. Accordingly, the changes in the values of these derivatives are recorded currently in cost of sales in our Consolidated\nStatements of Earnings.\nAlthough we do not meet the criteria for cash flow hedge accounting, we believe that these instruments are effective in achieving our objective of providing\ncertainty in the future price of commodities purchased for use in our supply chain. Accordingly, for purposes of measuring segment operating performance\nthese gains and losses are reported in unallocated corporate items outside of segment operating results until such time that the exposure we are managing\naffects earnings.

Primary\nexposures include U.S. Treasury rates, LIBOR, Euribor, and commercial paper rates in the United States and Europe. We use interest rate swaps, forward-\nstarting interest rate swaps, and treasury locks to hedge our exposure to interest rate changes, to reduce the volatility of our financing costs, and to achieve a\ndesired proportion of fixed rate versus floating-rate debt, based on current and projected market conditions. Generally under these swaps, we agree with a\ncounterparty to exchange the difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate interest amounts based on an agreed upon notional principal amount.\nFloating Interest Rate Exposures — Floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges, as are all hedges of forecasted issuances of\ndebt. Effectiveness is assessed based on either the perfectly effective hypothetical derivative method or changes in the present value of interest payments on\nthe underlying debt. Effective gains and losses deferred to AOCI are reclassified into earnings over the life of the associated debt. Ineffective gains and\nlosses are recorded as net interest.

We\nalso generally swap our foreign-denominated commercial paper borrowings and nonfunctional currency intercompany loans back to U.S. dollars or the\nfunctional currency of the entity with foreign exchange exposure. The gains or losses on these derivatives offset the foreign currency revaluation gains or\nlosses recorded in earnings on the associated borrowings. We generally do not hedge more than 18 months in advance.\nAs of May 26, 2019, the net notional value of foreign exchange derivatives was $1,008.5 million. The amount of hedge ineffectiveness was less than\n$1 million in fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017.\nWe also have net investments in foreign subsidiaries that are denominated in euros. We previously hedged a portion of these net investments by issuing\neuro-denominated commercial paper and foreign exchange forward contracts. As of May 26, 2019, we hedged a portion of these net investments with\n€2,200.0 million of euro denominated bonds. As of May 26, 2019, we had deferred net foreign currency transaction losses of $51.5 million in AOCI\nassociated with net investment hedging activity.\nEQUITY INSTRUMENTS\nEquity price movements affect our compensation expense as certain investments made by our employees in our deferred compensation plan are revalued.\nWe use equity swaps to manage this risk.

STOCK PLANS\nWe use broad-based stock plans to help ensure that management’s interests are aligned with those of our shareholders. As of May 26, 2019, a total of\n30.3 million shares were available for grant in the form of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and shares of unrestricted stock under the\n2017 Stock Compensation Plan (2017 Plan). The 2017 Plan also provides for the issuance of cash-settled share-based units, stock appreciation rights, and\nperformance-based stock awards. Stock-based awards now outstanding include some granted under the 2007, 2009, and 2011 stock plans and the 2006 and\n2011 compensation plans for non-employee directors, under which no further awards may be granted. The stock plans provide for potential accelerated\nvesting of awards upon retirement, termination, or death of eligible employees and directors.\nStock Options\nThe estimated fair values of stock options granted and the assumptions used for the Black-Scholes option-pricing model were as follows:\n \n \n  \nFiscal Year\n \n \n  \n2019   \n2018   \n2017 \n \n \nEstimated fair values of stock options granted\n  \n$\n5.35    \n$\n6.18    \n$\n8.80   \nAssumptions:\n  \n  \n  \n Risk-free interest rate\n  \n \n2.9 %   \n \n2.2%   \n \n1.7 % \n Expected term\n  \n 8.5 years    \n 8.2 years     \n 8.5 years \n Expected volatility\n  \n \n16.3 %   \n \n15.8%   \n \n17.8 % \n Dividend yield\n  \n \n4.3 %   \n \n3.6%   \n \n2.9 % \n \n \nWe estimate the fair value of each option on the grant date using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires us to make predictive assumptions\nregarding future stock price volatility, employee exercise behavior, dividend yield, and the forfeiture rate. We estimate our future stock price volatility using\nthe historical volatility over the expected term of the option, excluding time periods of volatility we believe a marketplace participant would exclude in\nestimating our stock price volatility. We also have considered, but did not use, implied volatility in our estimate, because trading activity in options on our\nstock, especially those with tenors of greater than 6 months, is insufficient to provide a reliable measure of expected volatility.\n \n85\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOur expected term represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical data to estimate option exercises and\nemployee terminat",

RETIREMENT BENEFITS AND POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans\nWe have defined benefit pension plans covering many employees in the United States, Canada, Switzerland, France, and the United Kingdom. Benefits for\nsalaried employees are based on length of service and final average compensation. Benefits for hourly employees include various monthly amounts for each\nyear of credited service. Our funding policy is consistent with the requirements of applicable laws. We made no voluntary contributions to our principal\nU.S. plans in fiscal 2019 or 2018. We do not expect to be required to make any contributions in fiscal 2020. Our principal domestic retirement plan covering\nsalaried employees has a provision that any excess pension assets would be allocated to active participants if the plan is terminated within five years of a\nchange in control. All salaried employees hired on or after June 1, 2013, are eligible for a retirement program that does not include a defined benefit pension\nplan.\nIn fiscal 2018, we approved an amendment to reorganize the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans and the supplemental pension plans that resulted in\nthe spinoff of a portion of the General Mills Pension Plan (the Plan) and the 2005 Supplemental Retirement Plan and the Supplemental Retirement Plan\n(Grandfathered) (together, the Supplemental Plans) into new plans effective May 31, 2018. The benefits offered to the plans’ participants were unchanged.\nThe result of the reorganization was the creation of the General Mills Pension Plan I (Plan I) and the 2005 Supplemental Retirement Plan I and the\nSupplemental Retirement Plan I (Grandfathered) (together, the Supplemental Plans I). The reorganization was made to facilitate a targeted investment\nstrategy over time and to provide additional flexibility in evaluating opportunities to reduce risk and volatility. Actuarial gains and losses associated with the\nPlan and the Supplemental Plans are amortized over the average remaining service life of the active participants. Actuarial gains and losses associated with\nthe Plan I and the Supplemental Plans I are amortized over the average remaining life of the participants.\n \n88\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOther Postretirement Benefit Plans\nWe also sponsor plans that provide health care benefits to many of our retirees in the United States, Can",

Rates are graded down annually until the ultimate trend rate of 4.5 percent is reached in 2029 for all retirees. The trend rates are\napplicable for calculations only if the retirees’ benefits increase as a result of health care inflation. The ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually, as necessary,\nto approximate the current economic view on the rate of long-term inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium.

The TCJA results in significant revisions to the U.S. corporate income tax system, including a\nreduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate, implementation of a territorial system, and a one-time deemed repatriation tax on untaxed foreign earnings.\nAs a result of the TCJA, we recorded a provisional benefit of $523.5 million during fiscal 2018. During fiscal 2019, we completed our accounting for the\ntax effects of the TCJA and recorded a benefit of $7.2 million which included adjustments to the transition tax and the measurement of our net U.S. deferred\ntax liability. While our accounting for the recorded impact of the TCJA is deemed to be complete, these amounts were based on prevailing regulations and\ncurrently available information, and any additional guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) could impact the aforementioned amounts in\nfuture periods.\nThe legislation also includes provisions that affected our fiscal 2019 results, including but not limited to, a reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate on\ndomestic operations; the creation of a new minimum tax called the base erosion anti-abuse tax; a new provision that taxes U.S. allocated expenses as well as\ncurrently taxes certain income from foreign operations (Global Intangible Low Tax Income or GILTI); a new limitation on deductible interest expense; the\nrepeal of the domestic manufacturing deduction; and limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation.\nWhile the new legislation generally eliminates U.S. federal income tax on dividends from foreign subsidiaries going forward, certain income earned by\nforeign subsidiaries must be included currently in our U.S. taxable income under the new GILTI inclusion rules. Under U.S. GAAP, we are allowed to make\nan accounting policy election and record the taxes as a period cost as incurred or factor such amounts into the measurement of deferred taxes. In fiscal 2018,\nwe made an accounting policy election to record these taxes as a period cost.\nAs of May 26, 2019, we have not recognized a deferred tax liability for unremitted earnings of approximately $2.3 billion from our foreign operations\nbecause we currently believe our subsidiaries have invested the undistributed earnings indefinitely, or the earnings will be remitted in a tax-neutral\ntransaction. It is not practicable for us to determine the amount of unrecognized tax expense on these reinvested earnings. Deferred taxes are recorded for\nearnings of our foreign operations when we determine that such earnings are no longer indefinitely reinvested. As a result of the TCJA, we re-evaluated our\nassertion and have concluded that although earnings prior to fiscal 2018 will remain permanently reinvested, we will no longer make a permanent\nreinvestment assertion beginning with our fiscal 2018 earnings.

We elected to reclassify the stranded income tax effects of the TCJA of $329.4 million\nfrom AOCI to retained earnings. This reclassification consists of deferred taxes originally recorded in AOCI that exceed the newly enacted federal corporate\ntax rate.\nWe are subject to federal income taxes in the United States as well as various state, local, and foreign jurisdictions. A number of years may elapse before an\nuncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular\nuncertain tax position, we believe that our liabilities for income taxes reflect the most likely outcome. We adjust these liabilities, as well as the related\ninterest, in light of changing facts and circumstances. Settlement of any particular position would usually require the use of cash.\nThe number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. Our major taxing jurisdictions include the United States (federal and\nstate) and Canada. Various tax examinations by United States state taxing authorities could be conducted for any open tax year, which vary by jurisdiction,\nbut are generally from 3 to 5 years.\nSeveral state and foreign examinations are currently in progress. We do not expect these examinations to result in a material impact on our results of\noperations or financial position. During fiscal 2018, we recorded an adjustment related to a prior year which increased income tax expense by\n$40.9 million. We determined the adjustment to be immaterial to our Consolidated Statements of Earnings for the fiscal year ended May 27, 2018.

The RFB has\nproposed adjustments that effectively eliminate the goodwill amortization benefits related to this transaction. We believe we have meritorious defenses and\nintend to contest the disallowance.\nWe apply a more-likely-than-not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions.

To present this information, current period results for entities reporting in currencies other than United States dollars are\ntranslated into United States dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year, rather than the actual\naverage exchange rates in effect during the current fiscal year.

Level 1 provides the most reliable measure of fair value, while Level 3 generally requires significant management\njudgment. The three levels are defined as follows:\n \nLevel 1:\n  Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2:\n  \nObservable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or\nquoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in inactive markets.\nLevel 3:\n  Unobservable inputs reflecting management’s assumptions about the inputs used in pricing the asset or liability.\nFocus 6 platforms.

We have the necessary data for COGS, Revenue, Inventory, Accounts Receivable, and Accounts Payable for both FY2018 and FY2019.\n\n3. **Calculation:**\n   - **DIO (Days Inventory Outstanding):** \n     \\[\n     \\text{DIO} = 365 \\times \\left(\\frac{\\text{Average Inventory}}{\\text{FY2019 COGS}}\\right)\n     \\]\n     Average Inventory = \\((1,642.2 + 1,559.3) / 2 = 1,600.75\\)\n     \\[\n     \\text{DIO} = 365 \\times \\left(\\frac{1,600.75}{11,108.4}\\right)\n     \\]\n\n   - **DSO (Days Sales Outstanding):**\n     \\[\n     \\text{DSO} = 365 \\times \\left(\\frac{\\text{Average Accounts Receivable}}{\\text{FY2019 Revenue}}\\right)\n     \\]\n     Average Accounts Receivable = \\((1,684.2 + 1,679.7) / 2 = 1,681.95\\)\n     \\[\n     \\text{DSO} = 365 \\times \\left(\\frac{1,681.95}{16,865.2}\\right)\n     \\]\n\n   - **DPO (Days Payable Outstanding):**\n     \\[\n     \\text{DPO} = 365 \\times \\left(\\frac{\\text{Average Accounts Payable}}{\\text{FY2019 COGS} + \\text{Change in Inventory}}\\right)\n     \\]\n     Average Accounts Payable = \\((2,746.2 + 2,854.1) / 2 = 2,800.15\\)\n     Change in Inventory = \\(1,559.3 - 1,642.2 = -82.9\\)\n     \\[\n     \\text{DPO} = 365 \\times \\left(\\frac{2,800.15}{11,108.4 - 82.9}\\right)\n     \\]\n\n   - **CCC (Cash Conversion Cycle):**\n     \\[\n     \\text{CCC} = \\text{DIO} + \\text{DSO} - \\text{DPO}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Conflicting Answers:**\n   - There are no significant conflicts in the data extracted from the chunks. The figures used are consistent across the relevant chunks, and the citations support the extracted data.\n\nThe calculations can now be performed to derive the final CCC value for FY2019."
