If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then state that and explain why.\n\n---\n\nPlease provide succinct advice on the critical information we need to extract from the Financial document. Total length: 376493 characters to answer this question. \n\nAlso consider the following constraints:\n- In your response do NOT use numbered lists.\n- Do NOT structure your response as a sequence of steps.\n",
      "output": "To determine if Adobe has an improving operating margin profile as of FY2022, focus on extracting specific financial data related to Adobe's operating margin from the document. Look for the operating margin figures for FY2022 and compare them with previous fiscal years to identify any trends or improvements. Additionally, consider any commentary or analysis provided in the document that discusses changes in operating expenses, revenue growth, or strategic initiatives that might impact the operating margin.\n\nIf the document suggests that operating margin is not a useful metric for Adobe, it might be due to the nature of the company's business model or industry practices. For instance, if Adobe is heavily investing in growth initiatives or transitioning to a subscription-based model, other metrics like revenue growth, customer acquisition costs, or recurring revenue might be more indicative of its financial health and future prospects. Look for any explanations or justifications in the document that address why operating margin might not be the primary focus for evaluating Adobe's performance."

      "prompt": "# Decomposition Round #1\n\nYou (the supervisor) cannot directly read the document(s). Instead, you can assign small, isolated tasks to a less capable worker model that sees only a single chunk of text at a time. Any cross-chunk or multi-document reasoning must be handled by you.\n\n## Your Job: Write Two Python Functions\n\n### FUNCTION #1: `prepare_jobs(context, prev_job_manifests, prev_job_outputs) -> List[JobManifest]`\n- Break the document(s) into chunks (using the provided chunking function, if needed). Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 12 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`. All **multi-chunk integration** or **global reasoning** is your responsibility here.\n- Return one **aggregated string** suitable for further supervisor inspection.\n\n\n\n## Relevant Pydantic Models\n\nThe following models are already in the global scope. **Do NOT redefine or re-import them.**\n\n### JobManifest Model\n```\nclass JobManifest(BaseModel):\n    chunk: str  # the actual text for the chunk of the document\n    task: str  # the actual task instruction for the small model\n    advice: str  # optional, any additional advice on how to perform the task\n\n    chunk_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    task_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    job_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n\n```\n\n### JobOutput Model\n```\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    citation: Optional[str]\n    answer: Optional[str]\n\n```\n\n## Function Signatures\n```\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        context (List[str]): A list of documents.

Each task is atomic and focuses on a specific aspect of the document.\n\n- **transform_outputs**: This function filters and aggregates the outputs from the small language models. It filters out jobs with empty or irrelevant answers and organizes the results by task and chunk. The aggregated string includes all relevant information from the outputs, making it easier for the supervisor to review and make a final decision."

Assuming that the interest expense for FY2022 is approximately equal to the interest expense for FY2021, we can estimate the total revenue for FY2022 as follows: Total Revenue = Interest Expense / 0.01 = $112 million / 0.01 = $11,200 million.

These laws and regulations relate to a number of aspects of our business, including trade protection, import and \nexport control, anti-boycott, sanctions and embargoes, data and transaction processing security, payment card industry data \nsecurity standards, records management, user-generated content hosted on websites we operate, privacy practices, data \nresidency, corporate governance, anti-trust and competition, employee and third-party complaints, anti-corruption, gift policies, \nconflicts of interest, securities regulations and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment. The application of \nthese laws and regulations to our business is often unclear and may at times conflict. For example, in many foreign countries, \nparticularly in those with developing economies, it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by U.S. \nregulations applicable to us, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. We cannot provide assurance that our employees, \ncontractors, agents and business partners will not take actions in violation of our internal policies or U.S. laws. Compliance \nwith these laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in our business practices that result in reduced \nrevenue and profitability. Non-compliance could also result in fines, damages, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our \nemployees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation. \nTable of Contents\n27\n\n\nIn addition, approximately 49% of our employees are located outside the United States.

Certain revenue arrangements provide customers with unilateral \ncancellation rights, or options to either renew monthly on-premise term-based licenses or use committed funds to purchase \nother Adobe products or services.\nFully hosted subscription services (SaaS) allow customers to access hosted software during the contractual term without \ntaking possession of the software. Cloud-hosted subscription services may be sold on a fee-per-subscription period basis or \nbased on consumption or usage.\nWe recognize revenue ratably over the contractual service term for hosted services that are priced based on a committed \nnumber of transactions where the delivery and consumption of the benefit of the services occur evenly over time, beginning on \nthe date the services associated with the committed transactions are first made available to the customer and continuing through \nthe end of the contractual service term.

Shares outstanding under our 2022 \nPerformance Share Program may be earned based on the achievement of (i) an objective relative total stockholder return \nmeasured over a three-year performance period, as well as (ii) revenue-based financial metrics measured over three one-year \nperformance periods. Each type of performance goal is weighted 50% and achievement of each performance goal is determined \nindependently of the other. Shares associated with each performance goal are not awarded until the corresponding performance \ntargets are defined.\nShares outstanding under our 2021 and 2020 Performance Share Programs may be earned based on the achievement of \nan objective relative total stockholder return measured over a three-year performance period. \nPerformance share awards in each of our 2022, 2021 and 2020 Performance Share Programs will be earned and cliff-vest \nupon the later of (i) the three-year anniversary of the earliest vesting commencement date in the respective Performance Share \nProgram, or (ii) the ECC's certification of the level of achievement of the final performance period in the respective \nPerformance Share Program, contingent upon the participant’s continued service. Participants can earn between 0% and 200% \nof the target number of performance shares.\nAs of December 2, 2022, the shares awarded under our 2022, 2021 and 2020 Performance Share Programs remained \noutstanding and were yet to be earned.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nOur Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) allows eligible employee participants to purchase shares of our common \nstock at a discount through payroll deductions. The ESPP consists of twenty-four-month offering periods with four six-month \npurchase periods in each offering period. Employees purchase shares in each purchase period at 85% of the market value of our \nTable of Contents\nADOBE INC.\n NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n80\n\n\ncommon stock at either the beginning of the offering period or the end of the purchase period, whichever price is lower.

The \ntotal number of shares delivered and average purchase price paid per share were determined upon settlement based on the \nVolume Weighted Average Price (“VWAP”) over the term of the ASR, less an agreed upon discount.\nDuring fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, we entered into several structured stock repurchase agreements with large financial \ninstitutions, whereupon we provided them with prepayments totaling $4.15 billion, $3.95 billion and $3.05 billion, respectively. \nUnder the terms of these structured stock repurchase agreements, the financial institutions agreed to deliver shares to us at \nmonthly intervals during the respective contract terms, and the number of shares delivered each month was determined based \nTable of Contents\nADOBE INC.\n NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n83\n\n\non the total notional amount of the contracts, the number of trading days in the intervals and the VWAP of our stock during the \nintervals less an agreed upon discount.\nWe enter into these agreements in order to take advantage of repurchasing shares at a guaranteed discount to the VWAP \nof our common stock over a specified period of time.

There were no explicit \ncommissions or fees on these structured repurchases. Under the terms of the agreements, there is no requirement for the \nfinancial institutions to return any portion of the prepayment to us.\nDuring fiscal 2022, we repurchased a total of 15.7 million shares, including approximately 10.4 million shares at an \naverage price of $375.03 through structured repurchase agreements, as well as 5.3 million shares at an average purchase price \nof $451.55 through the ASR described above. Comparatively, we repurchased approximately 7.2 million shares at an average \nprice of $536.17 per share in fiscal 2021 and 8.0 million shares at an average price of $376.38 per share in fiscal 2020. \nFor fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, the prepayments were classified as treasury stock on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at \nthe payment date, though only shares physically delivered to us by December 2, 2022, December 3, 2021 and November 27, \n2020 were excluded from the computation of earnings per share.

Instead, it provides information on sales and marketing expenses, general and administrative expenses, and non-operating income (expense). To estimate operating margin, we can use the information on non-operating income (expense) and the fact that operating income is the difference between total revenue and total expenses.",

            "answer": "To estimate the operating margin for FY2022, we need to calculate the operating income. We can use the information on non-operating income (expense) and the fact that operating income is the difference between total revenue and total expenses. However, the total expenses are not provided in the text. We can only estimate the operating margin using the information on non-operating income (expense). Assuming that the non-operating income (expense) is a small portion of the total expenses, we can estimate the operating margin as follows: Operating Margin = 1 - (Non-Operating Income (Expense) / Total Revenue). Unfortunately, the total revenue is not provided in the text, so we cannot calculate the exact operating margin. However, we can estimate it using the provided data. Let's assume that the total revenue for FY2022 is approximately equal to the total revenue for FY2021, which is not provided in the text. However, we can use the information on interest expense to estimate the total revenue. Interest Expense = 1% of Total Revenue. Assuming that the interest expense for FY2022 is approximately equal to the interest expense for FY2021, we can estimate the total revenue for FY2022 as follows: Total Revenue = Interest Expense / 0.01 = $112 million / 0.01 = $11,200 million. Now, we can estimate the operating margin for FY2022 as follows: Operating Margin = 1 - (Non-Operating Income (Expense) / Total Revenue) = 1 - (-$90 million / $11,200 million) = 1 + 0.008 = 1.008 or 0.8%."

What information we have gathered\n2. Whether it is sufficient to answer the question\n3. If not sufficient, what specific information is missing\n4. If sufficient, how we would calculate or derive the answer\n5. If there are conflicting answers:\n--> Use citations to select the correct answer if there are conflicting answers.\n\nBe brief and concise. No need for structured output - just think through the steps. You MUST respond in markdown format (for $ signs make sure to use escape character \\ before the $ sign).\n",
      "output": "### Analysis\n\n1. **Information Gathered**:\n   - The operating margin figures for FY2022 and previous years were not directly available in the document excerpts. However, some estimates and calculations were provided based on available financial data.\n   - Several chunks provided estimates of operating margins using different methods, such as dividing operating income by total revenue or using gross profit as a percentage of revenue.\n   - Commentary on the relevance of operating margin as a metric for Adobe was sparse but indicated that it is considered important due to factors like competitive environment, customer price sensitivity, and potential impacts from security and intellectual property issues.\n\n2. **Sufficiency of Information**:\n   - The information is not entirely sufficient to definitively answer whether Adobe has an improving operating margin profile as of FY2022. The estimates provided are based on partial data and assumptions, which may not accurately reflect the actual operating margins.\n   - The relevance of operating margin as a metric for Adobe is somewhat supported by the commentary, but it lacks comprehensive analysis or explicit statements from the document.\n\n3. **Missing Information**:\n   - Exact operating margin figures for FY2022 and previous years are missing.\n   - A clear trend analysis of operating margins over the years is not available.\n   - More detailed commentary on the strategic importance of operating margin for Adobe would be helpful.\n\n4. **Calculation/Derivation**:\n   - If we had the exact figures for operating income and total revenue, we could calculate the operating margin as (Operating Income / Total Revenue) * 100.\n   - The estimates provided suggest a slight decline in operating margin from FY2021 to FY2022, but these are not definitive.\n\n5. **Conflicting Answers**:\n   - There are conflicting estimates of operating margins due to different calculation methods and assumptions. For instance, one estimate suggests an operating margin of 39.5% for FY2022, while another suggests 49.2%.\n   - Without direct citations of exact figures, it is challenging to resolve these conflicts. The most reliable approach would be to refer to Adobe's official financial statements or reports for precise data.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTo conclusively determine Adobe's operating margin profile and its relevance as a metric, access to the full financial statements or a detailed section of the MD&A would be necessary. The current data provides a rough estimate but lacks the precision needed for a definitive analysis."

It assigns two tasks: one for extracting operating margin figures and another for extracting commentary on the relevance of operating margin as a metric for Adobe. Each task is applied to every chunk, ensuring comprehensive coverage.\n\n- **transform_outputs**: This function filters and aggregates the outputs from the small language models. It filters out jobs with empty or null answers and organizes the results by task and chunk, providing a structured view of the extracted information. This allows for easy analysis of whether Adobe's operating margin is improving and if operating margin is a relevant metric for the company."

We recognize that everyone \ndeserves respect and equal treatment, regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, \ncultural background or religious belief. As of December 2, 2022, women represented 34.6% of our global employees, and \nunderrepresented minorities (“URMs,” defined as those who identify as Black/African American, Hispanic/Latinx, Native \nAmerican, Pacific Islander and/or two or more races) represented 11.7% of our U.S. employees. To continue to improve \nemployee representation, we have declared a set of aspirational goals for women in leadership positions globally, \nunderrepresented minorities in leadership positions in the United States and overall Black representation. \nWe have a three-pillar strategy to grow the diversity of our workforce over time, on which we have continued to drive \nprogress during fiscal 2022:\n•\nWorkforce: We take actions to improve the hiring, retention and promotion of a more diverse workforce to \nachieve our aspirational goals. In fiscal 2022, we sourced candidates from a variety of conferences and partnerships, \nsuch as AfroTech, AdColor, BreakLine, HBCU 20x20 and Management Leadership for Tomorrow. We have \ncontinued to develop and invest in our partnerships with historically black colleges and universities and Hispanic-\nserving institutions. We are investing in the success of underrepresented candidates and employees through mentoring, \nleadership, employee and internship programs and career coaching. \n•\nWorkplace: We are building an inclusive environment that inspires a sense of belonging and encourages \npeople to be their authentic selves. We continue to support our employee resource groups to create community for \nemployees from underrepresented groups. Our Taking Action initiative is focused on accelerating the representation, \ndevelopment and success of Adobe’s Black employees and other underrepresented groups. We host annual learning \nevents, including our Juneteenth Global Day of Learning and our Adobe for All Week events.\nTable of Contents\n16\n\n\n•\nEcosystem: We strive to bring progress on diversity to our brand, products, partnerships, community \nengagement and the vendors we use. We collaborate with industry peers to advance diversity across multiple \ndimensions, including through our participation in the CEO Action on Diversity & Inclusion, The Valuable 500, the \nAscend 5-Point Action Agenda and ParityPledge. In fiscal 2022, we launched the Adobe Equity and Advancement \nInitiative, a multi-faceted grantmaking program to support non-profit organizations, and we continued to invest in our \nSupplier Diversity program to purchase goods and services from businesses that are certified as majority-owned and \noperated by underrepresented groups.\nWe invest in analysis and transparency to demonstrate our commitment to fair compensation.

The open judicial questions and regulatory interpretations related to the \nvalidity of transfers using Standard Contractual Clauses have resulted in some changes in the obligations required to provide \nour services in the European Union and could expose us to potential sanctions and fines for non-compliance. Several other \ncountries, including China, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, Hong Kong and Japan, have also established specific legal \nrequirements for cross-border transfers of personal information and for data localization (i.e., where personal data must remain \nstored in the country). If other countries implement more restrictive regulations for cross-border data transfers or do not permit \ndata to leave the country of origin, such developments could adversely impact our business and our enterprise customers’ \nbusiness, our financial condition and our results of operations in those jurisdictions.\nOur intellectual property portfolio is a valuable asset and we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights, \nincluding our source code, from infringement or unauthorized copying, use or disclosure.\nOur intellectual property portfolio is a valuable asset. Infringement or misappropriation of our patents, trademarks, trade \nsecrets, copyrights and other intellectual property rights could result in lost revenues and ultimately reduce their value. \nPreventing unauthorized use or infringement of our intellectual property rights is inherently difficult. We actively combat \nsoftware piracy as we enforce our intellectual property rights, but we nonetheless lose significant revenue due to illegal use of \nour software. If piracy activities continue at historical levels or increase, they may further harm our business.

If the total unrecognized tax benefits as of December 2, 2022, \nDecember 3, 2021 and November 27, 2020 were recognized, $203 million, $199 million and $136 million would decrease the \nrespective effective tax rates.\nAs of December 2, 2022 and December 3, 2021, the combined amounts of accrued interest and penalties related to tax \npositions taken on our tax returns were approximately $17 million and $22 million, respectively. These amounts were included \nin long-term income taxes payable in their respective years.\nThe timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax \npayments that are part of any audit settlement process.

As of December 2, 2022, $583 million of \nprepayment remained under our outstanding structured stock repurchase agreement.\nSubsequent to December 2, 2022, as part of the December 2020 stock repurchase authority, we entered into an \naccelerated share repurchase agreement with a large financial institution whereupon we provided them with a prepayment of  \n$1.4 billion and received an initial delivery of 3.2 million shares, which represents approximately 75% of our prepayment. \nUpon completion of the $1.4 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement, $5.15 billion remains under our December 2020 \nauthority.\nSee section titled “Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity \nSecurities” in Part II, Item 5 of this report for stock repurchases during the quarter ended December 2, 2022 and Note 14 of \nour Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further",

Training revenues are recognized as the services \nare performed. Our maintenance and support offerings, which entitle customers, partners and developers to receive desktop \nproduct upgrades and enhancements or technical support, depending on the offering, are generally recognized ratably over the \nterm of the arrangement.

In reaching this conclusion, we considered the nature of our \npromise to Creative Cloud and Document Cloud customers, which is to provide a complete end-to-end creative design or \ndocument workflow solution that operates seamlessly across multiple devices and teams. We fulfill this promise by providing \naccess to a solution that integrates cloud-based and on-premise/on-device features that, together through their integration, \nprovide functionalities, utility and workflow efficiencies that could not be obtained from either the on-premise/on-device \nsoftware or cloud services on their own.\nCloud-based features that are integral to our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings and that work together with \nthe on-premise/on-device s",

Contract assets are typically related to subscription and hosted service contracts where the transaction price allocated \nto the satisfied performance obligations exceeds the value of billings to date. Contract assets are included in prepaid expenses \nand other current assets for the current portion and other assets for the long-term portion on the Consolidated Balance \nSheets. We regularly review contract asset balances for impairment, considering factors such as historical experience, credit-\nworthiness, age of the balance, current economic conditions and a reasonable and supportable forecast of future economic \nconditions. Contract asset impairments were not material in fiscal 2022 and 2021. Contract assets were $97 million and $85 \nmillion as of December 2, 2022 and December 3, 2021, respectively.\nDeferred Revenue and Remaining Performance Obligations\nDeferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from \nsubscription services, including non-cancellable and non-refundable committed funds and refundable customer deposits. \nDeferred revenue is recognized as revenue when transfer of control to customers has occurred. Customers are typically invoiced \nfor these agreements in regular installments and revenue is recognized ratably over the contractual subscription period. The \ndeferred revenue balance is influenced by several factors, including the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, \ninvoice timing, size and new business linearity within the quarter. Deferred revenue does not represent the total contract value \nof annual or multi-year non-cancellable subscription agreements. \nPayment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within \n30 to 60 days. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined \nour contracts generally do not include a significant financing component.

Contract assets are typically related to subscription and hosted service contracts where the transaction price allocated \nto the satisfied performance obligations exceeds the value of billings to date. Contract assets are included in prepaid expenses \nand other current assets for the current portion and other assets for the long-term portion on the Consolidated Balance \nSheets. We regularly review contract asset balances for impairment, considering factors such as historical experience, credit-\nworthiness, age of the balance, current economic conditions and a reasonable and supportable forecast of future economic \nconditions. Contract asset impairments were not material in fiscal 2022 and 2021. Contract assets were $97 million and $85 \nmillion as of December 2, 2022 and December 3, 2021, respectively.\nDeferred Revenue and Remaining Performance Obligations\nDeferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from \nsubscription services, including non-cancellable and non-refundable committed funds and refundable customer deposits. \nDeferred revenue is recognized as revenue when transfer of control to customers has occurred. Customers are typically invoiced \nfor these agreements in regular installments and revenue is recognized ratably over the contractual subscription period. The \ndeferred revenue balance is influenced by several factors, including the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, \ninvoice timing, size and new business linearity within the quarter. Deferred revenue does not represent the total contract value \nof annual or multi-year non-cancellable subscription agreements. \nPayment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within \n30 to 60 days. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined \nour contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to \nprovide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services, such as invoicing at the \nbeginning of a subscription term with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, and not to receive financing from our \ncustomers.

      "output": "### Analysis\n\n1. **Information Gathered**:\n   - The collected outputs indicate that explicit operating margin figures for FY2022 and previous years are not directly available in the document excerpts. However, some estimates and calculations were attempted using available data on revenue and operating expenses.\n   - There is commentary suggesting that operating margin is relevant for Adobe due to competitive factors, potential costs (e.g., security efforts, AI expansion), and its impact on profitability and stock price.\n   - Some outputs attempted to calculate operating margins using revenue and cost data, but these are estimates and not directly extracted from the document.\n\n2. **Sufficiency of Information**:\n   - The information is not sufficient to definitively answer whether Adobe has an improving operating margin profile as of FY2022. The lack of explicit figures and reliance on estimates means we cannot confidently assess the trend in operating margins.\n   - The commentary on the relevance of operating margin is useful but does not provide a comprehensive analysis of its importance relative to other metrics.\n\n3. **Missing Information**:\n   - Exact operating margin figures for FY2022 and previous years are missing. These figures are crucial to determine if there is an improvement.\n   - A detailed analysis or discussion on the strategic importance of operating margin compared to other financial metrics for Adobe is also lacking.\n\n4. **Calculation or Derivation**:\n   - If we had the exact figures, we could calculate the operating margin as \\((\\text{Operating Income} / \\text{Revenue}) \\times 100\\%\\) for each year and compare them to assess improvement.\n   - Without explicit figures, any calculation would be speculative and not reliable.\n\n5. **Conflicting Answers**:\n   - There are conflicting estimates due to different calculation methods and assumptions. Without explicit figures or a clear citation, it is challenging to resolve these conflicts.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTo conclusively answer the question, we need explicit operating margin figures for FY2022 and previous years. Additionally, a more detailed discussion on the strategic relevance of operating margin for Adobe would help contextualize its importance relative to other metrics. Without this information, we cannot definitively determine if Adobe's operating margin profile is improving or assess its relevance as a metric."

Any of these factors could create downward pressure on pricing and gross margins \nand could adversely affect our renewal and upsell and cross-sell rates, as well as our ability to attract new customers. \nOur future success will depend on our continued ability to enhance and integrate our existing products and services, \nintroduce new products and services in a timely and cost-effective manner, meet changing customer expectations and needs, \nextend our core technology into new applications, and anticipate emerging standards, business models, software delivery \nmethods and other technological developments. For example, consumers continue to migrate from personal computers to tablet \nand mobile devices and from desktop to the web. While we offer our products on a variety of platforms, if we cannot continue \nadapting our products to tablet and mobile devices or the web, or if our competitors can adapt their products more quickly than \nus, our business could be harmed. In addition, releases of new devices or operating systems may make it more difficult for our \nproducts to perform or may require significant cost to adapt our solutions. The potential costs and delays incurred as a result \ncould harm our business. If we fail to anticipate or misjudge customers’ rapidly changing needs and expectations or adapt to \nemerging technological trends, our market share and results of operations could suffer.\nFurthermore, some of our competitors and potential competitors enjoy competitive advantages, such as greater financial, \ntechnical, sales, marketing and other resources, broader brand awareness and access to larger customer bases. As a result of \nthese advantages, potential and current customers might select the products and services of our competitors, causing a loss of \nour market share. Our competitors, including large enterprises, may develop products, features or services that are similar to \nours or that achieve greater acceptance, may undertake more far-reaching and successful product development efforts or \nmarketing campaigns, or may adopt more aggressive pricing policies.\nFor additional information regarding our competition and the risks arising out of the competitive environment in which \nwe operate, see the section title",

We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on \nhistorical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could \ndiffer materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We evaluate our assumptions, judgments and \nestimates on a regular basis. We also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the \nBoard of Directors.\nWe believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition, business \ncombinations and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. These areas are \nkey components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules requiring us to make judgments and estimates, and \nconsequently, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Historically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates \nrelative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results.\nRevenue Recognition \nOur contracts with customers may include multiple goods and services. For example, some of our offerings include both \non-premise and/or on-device software licenses and cloud services. Determining whether the software licenses and the cloud \nservices are distinct from each other, and therefore performance obligations to be accounted for separately, or not distinct from \neach other, and therefore part of a single performance obligation, may require significant judgment. We have concluded that the \non-premise/on-device software licenses and cloud services provided in our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud subscription \nofferings are not distinct from each other such that revenue from each offering should be recognized ratably over the \nsubscription period for which the cloud services ",

Under this method, income tax expense is \nrecognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are \nrecognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of \nassets and liabilities, and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Significant judgment is required in determining our \ncurrent provision for income taxes and deferred tax assets or liabilities. We record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax \nassets to an amount for which realization is more likely than not.\nOur assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account our \ninterpretation and application of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future examinations conducted by \ndomestic and foreign tax authorities. We have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving \ntax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these \nexaminations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and associated reserves.

These strategies include increasing the value Creative Cloud users receive, such \nas offering new desktop, web and mobile applications, as well as targeted promotions and offers that attract past customers and \npotential users to experience and ultimately subscribe to Creative Cloud.

If the total unrecognized tax benefits as of December 2, 2022, \nDecember 3, 2021 and November 27, 2020 were recognized, $203 million, $199 million and $136 million would decrease the \nrespective effective tax rates.\nAs of December 2, 2022 and December 3, 2021, the combined amounts of accrued interest and penalties related to tax \npositions taken on our tax returns were approximately $17 million and $22 million, respectively. These amounts were included \nin long-term income taxes payable in their respective years.\nThe timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax \npayments that are part of any audit settlement process. These events could cause large fluctuations in the balance sheet \nclassification of our tax assets and liabilities. We believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either \ncertain audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. Although \nthe timing of resolution, settlement and closing of audits is not certain, it is reasonably possible that the underlying \nunrecognized tax benefits may decrease by up to $25 million over the next 12 months.\nOur future effective tax rates may be materially affected by changes in the tax rates in jurisdictions where our income is \nearned, changes in jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed, changes in the valuation of our \ndeferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in or interpretation of tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do \nbusiness, or unexpected changes in business and market conditions that could reduce certain tax benefits.\nIn addition, the United States and other countries and jurisdictions in which we conduct business, including those \ncovered by governing bodies that enact tax laws applicable to us, such as the European Commission of the European Union, \ncould make changes to relevant tax, accounting or other laws and interpretations thereof that have a material impact to us. \nThese countries, governmental bodies and intergovernmental economic organizations such as the Organization for Economic \nCooperation and Development, have or could make unprecedented assertions about how taxation is determined and, in some \ncases, have proposed or enacted new laws that are contrary to the way in which rules and regulations have historically been \ninterpreted and applied.

At \nDecember 2, 2022, the outstanding balance sheet hedging derivatives had maturities of 180 days or less.\nSee Note 6 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our derivative financial \ninstruments.\nInterest Rate Risk\nShort-Term Investments and Fixed Income Securities\nAt December 2, 2022, we had debt securities classified as short-term investments of $1.86 billion. Changes in interest \nrates could adversely affect the market value of these investments. A sensitivity analysis was performed on our short-term \ninvestment portfolio as of December 2, 2022, based on an estimate of the hypothetical changes in market value of the portfolio \nthat would result from an immediate parallel shift in the yield curve. A 150 basis point increase in interest rates would lead to a \n$20 million decrease in the market value of our short-term investments. Conversely, a 150 basis point decrease in interest rates \nwould lead to a $20 million increase in the market value of our short-term investments.\nSenior Notes\nAs of December 2, 2022, we had $4.15 billion of senior notes outstanding which bear interest at fixed rates, and \ntherefore do not subject us to financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates. As of December 2, 2022, the \ntotal carrying amount of our senior notes was $4.13 billion and the related fair value based on observable market prices in less \nactive markets was $3.88 billion.\nSee Note 17 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our senior notes.\nTable of Contents\n51\n\n\nITEM 8.

We have operations \nin the Americas; Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”); and Asia-Pacific (“APAC”).\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include those of Adobe and its subsidiaries, after elimination of \nall intercompany accounts and transactions. We have prepared the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements in \naccordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and pursuant to the rules \nand regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).\nUse of Estimates\nIn preparing Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP and pursuant to the \nrules and regulations of the SEC, we must make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated \nFinancial Statements and accompanying Notes. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, sales allowances and programs, bad \ndebts, stock-based compensation, determining the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities, litigation and income \ntaxes. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates.\nFiscal Year\nOur fiscal year is a 52- or 53-week year that ends on the Friday closest to November 30. Our financial results for fiscal \n2021 benefited from an extra week in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 due to our 52/53 week financial calendar whereby fiscal \n2021 was a 53-week year compared with fiscal 2022 and 2020 which were 52-week years.\nReclassifications\nCertain prior year amounts, which are not material, have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation in the \nConsolidated Balance Sheets and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenue is derived from the sale of cloud-enabled software subscriptions, cloud-hosted offerings, term-based, \nroyalty, and perpetual software licenses, associated software maintenance and support plans, consulting services, training and \ntechnical support. Most of our enterprise customer arrangements involve multiple promises to our customers.\nRevenue is recognized when a contract exists between us and a customer and upon transfer of control of promised \nproducts or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those \nproducts or services. We enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which may be \nTable of Contents\nADOBE INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n58\n\n\ncapable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations, or in the case of offerings such as cloud-\nenabled Creative Cloud and Document Cloud, accounted for as a single performance obligation.

Certain revenue arrangements provide customers with unilateral \ncancellation rights, or options to either renew monthly on-premise term-based licenses or use committed funds to purchase \nother Adobe products or services.\nFully hosted subscription services (SaaS) allow customers to access hosted software during the contractual term without \ntaking possession of the software. Cloud-hosted subscription services may be sold on a fee-per-subscription period basis or \nbased on consumption or usage.\nWe recognize revenue ratably over the contractual service term for hosted services that are priced based on a committed \nnumber of transactions where the delivery and consumption of the benefit of the services occur evenly over time, beginning on \nthe date the services associated with the committed transactions are first made available to the customer and continuing through \nthe end of the contractual service term. Over-usage fees and fees based on the actual number of transactions are billed in \naccordance with contract terms as these fees are incurred and are included in the transaction price of an arrangement as variable \nconsideration. Fees based on a number of transactions, where invoicing is aligned to the pattern of performance, customer \nbenefit and consumption, are typically accounted for utilizing the “as-invoiced” practical expedient. Revenue for subscriptions \nsold as a fee per period is recognized ratably over the contractual term as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes \nthe benefit of the underlying service.\nWhen cloud-enabled services are highly integrated and interrelated with on-premise software, such as in our cloud-\nenabled Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings, the individual components are not considered distinct and revenue is \nrecognized ratably over the subscription period for which the cloud-enabled services are provided.\nThe subscription support plans related to those customer arrangements whose revenues we classify as subscription \nrevenues represent stand-ready performance obligations.

Certain performance obligations may require payment before delivery of the license or service to the customer. \nIncluded in trade receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are unbilled receivable balances which have not yet been \ninvoiced, and are typically related to license revenue or services which are delivered prior to invoicing. As of December 2, \n2022, the balance of trade receivables, net of allowances for doubtful accounts, was $2.07 billion, inclusive of unbilled \nreceivables of $93 million. As of December 3, 2021, the balance of trade receivables, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, \nwas $1.88 billion, inclusive of unbilled receivables of $82 million.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts which reflects our best estimate of potentially uncollectible trade \nreceivables and is based on both specific and general reserves. We maintain general reserves on a collective basis by \nconsidering factors such as historical experience, credit-worthiness, the age of the trade receivable balances, current economic \nconditions and a reasonable and supportable forecast of future economic conditions. The allowance for doubtful accounts was \n$23 million and $16 million as of December 2, 2022 and December 3, 2021, respectively.\nContract Assets\nA contract asset is recognized when a conditional right to consideration exists and transfer of control has \noccurred.

Contract assets are typically related to subscription and hosted service contracts where the transaction price allocated \nto the satisfied performance obligations exceeds the value of billings to date. Contract assets are included in prepaid expenses \nand other current assets for the current portion and other assets for the long-term portion on the Consolidated Balance \nSheets. We regularly review contract asset balances for impairment, considering factors such as historical experience, credit-\nworthiness, age of the balance, current economic conditions and a reasonable and supportable forecast of future economic \nconditions. Contract asset impairments were not material in fiscal 2022 and 2021. Contract assets were $97 million and $85 \nmillion as of December 2, 2022 and December 3, 2021, respectively.\nDeferred Revenue and Remaining Performance Obligations\nDeferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from \nsubscription services, including non-cancellable and non-refundable committed funds and refundable customer deposits. \nDeferred revenue is recognized as revenue when transfer of control to customers has occurred. Customers are typically invoiced \nfor these agreements in regular installments and revenue is recognized ratably over the contractual subscription period. The \ndeferred revenue balance is influenced by several factors, including the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, \ninvoice timing, size and new business linearity within the quarter. Deferred revenue does not represent the total contract value \nof annual or multi-year non-cancellable subscription agreements. \nPayment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within \n30 to 60 days. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined \nour contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to \nprovide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services, such as invoicing at the \nbeginning of a subscription term with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, and not to receive financing from our \ncustomers. Any potential financing fees are considered insignificant in the context of our contracts.\nAs of December 2, 2022, the balance of deferred revenue was $5.41 billion, which includes $99 million of refundable \ncustomer deposits. Refundable customer deposits represent arrangements in which the customer has a unilateral cancellation \nright for which we are obligated to refund amounts paid related to products or services not yet delivered or provided at the time \nof cancellation on a prorated basis. Arrangements with some of our enterprise customers with non-cancellable and non-\nrefundable committed funds provide options to either renew monthly on-premise term-based licenses or use some or a",

Significant movements in the deferred \nrevenue balance during the period consisted of increases due to payments received prior to transfer of control of the underlying \nperformance obligations to the customer and deferred revenue assumed through acquisition, which were offset by decreases due \nto revenue recognized in the period. During the year ended December 2, 2022, approximately $4.72 billion of revenue was \nrecognized that was included in the balance of deferred revenue as of December 3, 2021.\nTransaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations represents contracted revenue that has not yet been \nrecognized, which includes deferred revenue and unbilled amounts that will be recognized as revenue in future periods. \nTransaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations is influenced by several factors, including the timing of \nrenewals and average contract term. We applied practical expedients to exclude amounts related to performance obligations that \nare billed and recognized as they are delivered, optional purchases that do not represent material rights, sales- and usage-based \nroyalties not yet consumed and any estimated amounts of variable consideration that are subject to constraint. \nRemaining performance obligations were approximately $15.19 billion as of December 2, 2022. Non-cancellable and \nnon-refundable committed funds related to some of our enterprise customer agreements referred to in the paragraph above \ncomprised approximately 5% of the total remaining performance obligations. Approximately 72% of the remaining \nperformance obligations, excluding the aforementioned enterprise customer agreements, are expected to be recognized over the \nnext 12 months with the remainder recognized thereafter.\nContract Acquisition Costs\nWe recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefit of those \ncosts to be longer than one year. We have determined that certain sales incentive programs meet the requirements to be \ncapitalized. \nThe costs capitalized are primarily sales commissions paid to our sales force personnel. Capitalized costs may also \ninclude portions of fringe benefits and payroll taxes associated with compensation for incremental costs to acquire customer \ncontracts and incentive payments to partners.\nCapitalized costs to obtain a contract are amortized over the expected period of benefit, which we have determined, \nbased on analysis, to be 5 years.

We incurred a loss related to the settlement of the instruments which is amortized to interest expense \nover the term of our debt due February 1, 2030. See Note 17 for further details regarding our debt.\nAs of December 2, 2022, we had net derivative gains on our foreign exchange option contracts expected to be recognized \nwithin the next 18 months, of which $53 million of gains are expected to be recognized into revenue within the next 12 months. \nIn addition, we had net derivative losses on our foreign exchange forward contracts, of which $7 million of losses are expected \nto be recognized into operating expenses within the next 12 months, and net derivative losses on our Treasury lock agreements, \nof which $5 million is expected to be recognized into interest expense within the next 12 months.\nTo receive hedge accounting treatment, all hedging relationships are formally documented at the inception of the hedge, \nand the hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to future cash flows on hedged transactions. We record changes in \nfair value of these cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, \nuntil the forecasted transaction occurs. When the forecasted transaction affects earnings, we reclassify the related gain or loss \non the foreign currency revenue, foreign currency expense or Treasury lock cash flow hedge to revenue, operating expense or \ninterest expense, as applicable. In the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur, or it becomes probable that it \nwill not occur, we reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income \n(loss) to the same income statement line item as the hedged item. We evaluate hedge effectiveness at the inception of the hedge \nprospectively, and on an ongoing basis both retrospectively and prospectively. If we do not elect hedge accounting, or the \ncontract does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the changes in fair value from period to period are recorded in the \nsame income statement line item as the hedged item.\nFor fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, there were no net gains or losses recognized in income relating to hedges of forecasted \ntransactions that did not occur. \nNon-Designated Hedges\n",

The lack of explicit operating margin figures and comprehensive analysis makes it difficult to draw a reliable conclusion.\n\n3. **Missing Information**:\n   - Explicit operating margin figures for FY2022 and previous years.\n   - A consistent method of calculating operating margins across the years.\n   - Comprehensive commentary or analysis on the trends in operating margins.\n\n4. **Calculation or Derivation**:\n   - If we had the total revenue and total operating expenses for each year, we could calculate the operating margin as \\((\\text{Total Revenue} - \\text{Total Operating Expenses}) / \\text{Total Revenue}\\).\n   - Without consistent and explicit data, any calculation would be speculative.\n\n5. **Conflicting Answers**:\n   - There are conflicting inferences about the trend in operating margins, with some outputs suggesting improvement and others indicating a decline.\n   - Without explicit figures or a reliable method of calculation, it is not possible to resolve these conflicts using the available citations.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe current data is insufficient to conclusively determine whether Adobe has an improving operating margin profile as of FY2022. To answer the question accurately, we would need explicit operating margin figures or a consistent method to calculate them from reliable financial data. Additionally, a comprehensive analysis of the factors affecting operating margins would be necessary to understand the trends."

Any of these factors could create downward pressure on pricing and gross margins \nand could adversely affect our renewal and upsell and cross-sell rates, as well as our ability to attract new customers. \nOur future success will depend on our continued ability to enhance and integrate our existing products and services, \nintroduce new products and services in a timely and cost-effective manner, meet changing customer expectations and needs, \nextend our core technology into new applications, and anticipate emerging standards, business models, software delivery \nmethods and other technological developments. For example, consumers continue to migrate from personal computers to tablet \nand mobile devices and from desktop to the web. While we offer our products on a variety of platforms, if we cannot continue \nadapting our products to tablet and mobile devices or the web, or if our competitors can adapt their products more quickly than \nus, our business could be harmed. In addition, releases of new devices or operating systems may make it more difficult for our \nproducts to perform or may require significant cost to adapt our solutions. The potential costs and delays incurred as a result \ncould harm our business. If we fail to anticipate or misjudge customers’ rapidly changing needs and expectations or adapt to \nemerging technological trends, our market share and results of operations could suffer.\nFurthermore, some of our competitors and potential competitors enjoy competitive advantages, such as greater financial, \ntechnical, sales, marketing and other resources, broader brand awareness and access to larger customer bases. As a result of \nthese advantages, potential and current customers might select the products and services of our competitors, causing a loss of \nour market share. Our competitors, including large enterprises, may develop products, features or services that are similar to \nours or that achieve greater acceptance, may undertake more far-reaching and successful product development efforts or \nmarketing campaigns, or may adopt more aggressive pricing policies.\nFor additional information regarding our competition and the risks arising out of the competitive environment in which \nwe operate, see the section title",

We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on \nhistorical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could \ndiffer materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We evaluate our assumptions, judgments and \nestimates on a regular basis. We also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the \nBoard of Directors.\nWe believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition, business \ncombinations and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. These areas are \nkey components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules requiring us to make judgments and estimates, and \nconsequently, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Historically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates \nrelative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results.\nRevenue Recognition \nOur contracts with customers may include multiple goods and services. For example, some of our offerings include both \non-premise and/or on-device software licenses and cloud services. Determining whether the software licenses and the cloud \nservices are distinct from each other, and therefore performance obligations to be accounted for separately, or not distinct from \neach other, and therefore part of a single performance obligation, may require significant judgment. We have concluded that the \non-premise/on-device software licenses and cloud services provided in our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud subscription \nofferings are not distinct from each other such that revenue from each offering should be recognized ratably over the \nsubscription period for which the cloud services ",

In reaching this conclusion, we considered the nature of our \npromise to Creative Cloud and Document Cloud customers, which is to provide a complete end-to-end creative design or \ndocument workflow solution that operates seamlessly across multiple devices and teams. We fulfill this promise by providing \naccess to a solution that integrates cloud-based and on-premise/on-device features that, together through their integration, \nprovide functionalities, utility and workflow efficiencies that could not be obtained from either the on-premise/on-device \nsoftware or cloud services on their own.\nCloud-based features that are integral to our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings and that work together with \nthe on-premise/on-device software include, but are not limited to: Creative Cloud Libraries, which enable customers to access \ntheir work, settings, preferences and other assets seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices and collaborate across teams in \nreal time; shared reviews which enable simultaneous editing and commenting of digital assets across desktop, mobile and web; \nautomatic cloud rendering of a design which enables it to be worked on in multiple mediums; and Sensei, Adobe’s cloud-hosted \nartificial intelligence and machine learning framework, which enables features such as automated photo-editing, photograph \ncontent-awareness, natural language processing, optical character recognition and automated document tagging.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed \nbased upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The purchase price allocation process requires management to \nmake significant estimates and assumptions with respect to intangible assets and deferred revenue obligations. Although we \nbelieve the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable, they are based in part on historical experience, market \nconditions and information obtained from management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Examples of \ncritical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not \nlimited to:\n•\nfuture expected cash flows from software license sales, subscriptions, support agreements, consulting contracts and \nacquired developed technologies and patents;\n•\nexpected costs to develop acquired technologies and patents internally into commercially viable products;\nTable of Contents\n36\n\n\n•\nhistorical and expected customer attrition rates and anticipated growth in revenue from acquired customers;\n•\nthe acquired company’s trade name and trademarks as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired \ntrade name and trademarks will continue to be used in the combined company’s product portfolio;\n•\nthe expected use of the acquired assets; and \n•\ndiscount rates.\nIn connection with the purchase price allocations",

The estimated fair value of these obligations is determined utilizing a cost build-up approach. The cost \nbuild-up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin. \nUnanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, \nestimates or actual results.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is \nrecognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are \nrecognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of \nassets and liabilities, and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Significant judgment is required in determining our \ncurrent provision for income taxes and deferred tax assets or liabilities. We record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax \nassets to an amount for which realization is more likely than not.\nOur assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account our \ninterpretation and application of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future examinations conducted by \ndomestic and foreign tax authorities. We have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving \ntax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these \nexaminations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and associated reserves. To the extent that the final \ndetermination of any of these examinations is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for \nincome taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination is made.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements \nSee Note 1 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding recent accounting \npronouncements that are of significance, or potential significance to us. \nACQUISITIONS \nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we completed the acquisition of Frame.io, a privately held company that provides a \ncloud-based video collaboration platform, for approximately $1.24 billion and we began integrating Frame.io into our Digital \nMedia reportable segment.

If the total unrecognized tax benefits as of December 2, 2022, \nDecember 3, 2021 and November 27, 2020 were recognized, $203 million, $199 million and $136 million would decrease the \nrespective effective tax rates.\nAs of December 2, 2022 and December 3, 2021, the combined amounts of accrued interest and penalties related to tax \npositions taken on our tax returns were approximately $17 million and $22 million, respectively. These amounts were included \nin long-term income taxes payable in their respective years.\nThe timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax \npayments that are part of any audit settlement process. These events could cause large fluctuations in the balance sheet \nclassification of our tax assets and liabilities. We believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either \ncertain audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. Although \nthe timing of resolution, settlement and closing of audits is not certain, it is reasonably possible that the underlying \nunrecognized tax benefits may decrease by up to $25 million over the next 12 months.\nOur future effective tax rates may be materially affected by changes in the tax rates in jurisdictions where our income is \nearned, changes in jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed, changes in the valuation of our \ndeferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in or interpretation of tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do \nbusiness, or unexpected changes in business and market conditions that could reduce certain tax benefits.\nIn addition, the United States and other countries and jurisdictions in which we conduct business, including those \ncovered by governing bodies that enact tax laws applicable to us, such as the European Commission of the European Union, \ncould make changes to relevant tax, accounting or other laws and interpretations thereof that have a material impact to us. \nThese countries, governmental bodies and intergovernmental economic organizations such as the Organization for Economic \nCooperation and Development, have or could make unprecedented assertions about how taxation is determined and, in some \ncases, have proposed or enacted new laws that are contrary to the way in which rules and regulations have historically been \ninterpreted and applied.

See the section titled “Stock Repurchase Program” below.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources Considerations\nOur existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances may fluctuate during fiscal 2023 due to changes in our \nplanned cash outlay. \nCash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, risks \ndetailed in the section titled “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this report. Based on our current business plan and revenue \nprospects, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances, our anticipated cash flows from \noperations and our available credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital, operating resource expenditure and \ncapital expenditure requirements for the next twelve months.\nOur cash equivalent and short-term investment portfolio as of December 2, 2022 consisted of asset-backed securities, \ncorporate debt securities, foreign government securities, money market funds, municipal securities, time deposits, U.S. agency \nTable of Contents\n47\n\n\nsecurities and U.S. Treasury securities. We use professional investment management firms to manage a large portion of our \ninvested cash.\nWe expect to continue our investing activities, including short-term and long-term investments, purchases of computer \nsystems for research and development, sales and marketing, product support and administrative staff, and facilities expansion. \nFurthermore, cash reserves may be used to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program and to strategically acquire \ncompanies, products or technologies that are complementary to our business.\nOn September 15, 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement under which we intend to acquire Figma, Inc. (“Figma”) \nfor approximately $20 billion, comprised of approximately half cash and half stock, subject to customary purchase price \nadjustments. Approximately 6 million additional restricted stock units will be granted to Figma’s Chief Executive Officer and \nemployees that will vest over four years subsequent to closing. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and customary \nclosing conditions, and is expected to close in 2023. We will be required to pay Figma a reverse termination fee of $1 billion if \nthe transaction fails to receive regulatory clearance, assuming all other closing conditions have been satisfied or waived, or if it \nfails to close within 18 months from September 15, 2022.

Subject to the \nagreement of lenders, we may obtain up to an additional $500 million in commitments, for a maximum aggregate commitment \nof $2 billion. As of December 2, 2022, there were no outstanding borrowings under this credit agreement and the entire $1.5 \nbillion credit line remains available for borrowing. \nUnder the terms of our Revolving Credit Agreement, we are not prohibited from paying cash dividends unless payment \nwould trigger an event of default or if one currently exists. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable \nfuture.\nSenior Notes\nWe have $4.15 billion senior notes outstanding, which rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated \nindebtedness. As of December 2, 2022, the carrying value of our senior notes was $4.13 billion and our maximum commitment \nfor interest payments was $416 million for the remaining duration of our outstanding senior notes. Interest is payable semi-\nannually, in arrears on February 1 and August 1. Our senior notes do not contain any financial covenants. See Note 17 of our \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding our debt.\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we reclassified the senior notes due February 1, 2023 as current debt in our \nConsolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 2, 2022, the carrying value of our current debt was $500 million, net of the \nrelated discount and issuance costs. We intend to repay the current portion of our debt on or before the due date.\nContractual Obligations\nOur purchase obligations consist of agreements to purchase goods and services entered into in the ordinary course of \nbusiness. As of December 2, 2022, the value of our non-cancellable unconditional purchase obligations was $6.09 billion, \nprimarily relating to contracts with vendors for third-party hosting and data center services.

In \naddition, the U.S. Tax Act requires companies to capitalize and amortize research and development expenditures starting fiscal \n2023.

In December 2020, our Board of Directors granted authority to repurchase up to $15 billion in our common stock \nthrough the end of fiscal 2024.\nDuring fiscal 2022, we repurchased a total of 15.7 million shares, including approximately 10.4 million shares at an \naverage price of $375.03 through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022, as well as \n5.3 million shares at an average purchase price of $451.55 through an accelerated share repurchase agreement entered into \nduring the first quarter of fiscal 2022.\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we entered into a structured stock repurchase agreement with a large financial \ninstitution whereupon we provided them with a prepayment of $1.75 billion.

Historically, costs related to these \nindemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these \nindemnification provisions on our future results of operations.\nTo the extent permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for \ncertain events or occurrences while the officer or director is or was serving at our request in such capacity. The indemnification \nperiod covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officer’s or director’s lifetime.

We may use foreign exchange option contracts or forward contracts to hedge a \nportion of our forecasted foreign currency denominated revenue and expenses. Additionally, we hedge our net recognized \nforeign currency monetary assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and \ncash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. \nOur significant foreign currency revenue exposures for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:\n(in millions)\n2022\n2021\n2020\nEuro\n€ \n2,487 € \n2,209 € \n1,887 \nJapanese Yen\n¥ \n118,456 ¥ \n104,829 ¥ \n88,640 \nBritish Pounds\n£ \n737 £ \n669 £ \n562 \nAustralian Dollars\n$ \n876 $ \n768 $ \n645 \nAs of December 2, 2022, the total notional amounts of all outstanding foreign exchange contracts, including options and \nforwards, were $3.25 billion, which included the notional equivalent of $1.32 billion in Euros, $602 million in Indian Rupees, \n$480 million in British Pounds, $394 million in Japanese Yen, $338 million in Australian Dollars and $112 million in other \nforeign currencies.

This sensitivity \nanalysis measures the hypothetical market value resulting from a 10% shift in the value of exchange rates relative to the U.S. \nDollar. For option contracts, the Black-Scholes option pricing model was used. A 10% increase in the value of the U.S. Dollar \nand a corresponding decrease in the value of the hedged foreign currency asset would lead to an increase in the fair value of our \nfinancial hedging instruments by $75 million. A 10% decrease in the value of the U.S. Dollar would lead to an increase in the \nfair value of these financial instruments by $17 million.\nAs a general rule, we do not use foreign exchange contracts to hedge local currency denominated operating expenses in \ncountries where a natural hedge exists. For example, in many countries, revenue in the local currencies substantially offsets the \nlocal currency denominated operating expenses. We also have long-term investment exposures consisting of the capitalization \nand retained earnings in our non-U.S. Dollar functional currency foreign subsidiaries. As of December 2, 2022 and \nDecember 3, 2021, this long-term investment exposure totaled an absolute notional equivalent of $770 million and $749 \nmillion, respectively. At this time, we do not hedge these long-term investment exposures.\nWe do not use foreign exchange contracts for speculative trading purposes, nor do we hedge our foreign currency \nexposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates. We regularly review our hedging \nprogram and assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis.\nCash Flow Hedges of Forecasted Foreign Currency Revenue and Expenses\nWe may use foreign exchange purchased options or forward contracts to hedge foreign currency revenue denominated in \nEuros, British Pounds, Japanese Yen and Australian Dollars, or foreign currency expenses in Indian Rupees. We hedge these \ncash flow exposures to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. \nThese foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, have maturities of up to twelve months. We enter into these foreign \nexchange contracts to hedge forecasted revenue and expenses in the normal course of business and accordingly, they are not \nspeculative in nature.\nWe record changes in fair value of these cash flow hedges of foreign currency denominated revenue and expenses in \naccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, until the forecasted transaction occurs.",

We offer a line of \nproducts and services used by creative professionals, including photographers, video editors, graphic and experience designers \nand game developers; communicators, including content creators, students, marketers and knowledge workers; businesses of all \nsizes; and consumers for creating, managing, delivering, measuring, optimizing, engaging and transacting with compelling \ncontent and experiences across personal computers, smartphones, other electronic devices and digital media formats. \nWe market our products and services directly to enterprise customers through our sales force and local field offices. We \nlicense our products to end users through app stores and our own website at www.adobe.com. We offer many of our products \nvia a Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) model or a managed services model (both of which are referred to as hosted or cloud-\nbased) as well as through term subscription and pay-per-use models. We also distribute certain products and services through a \nnetwork of distributors, value-added resellers (“VARs”), systems integrators (“SIs”), independent software vendors (“ISVs”), \nretailers, software developers and original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”). In addition, we license our technology to \nhardware manufacturers, software developers and service providers for use in their products and solutions.

We have prepared the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements in \naccordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and pursuant to the rules \nand regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).\nUse of Estimates\nIn preparing Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP and pursuant to the \nrules and regulations of the SEC, we must make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated \nFinancial Statements and accompanying Notes. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, sales allowances and programs, bad \ndebts, stock-based compensation, determining the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities, litigation and income \ntaxes. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates.\nFiscal Year\nOur fiscal year is a 52- or 53-week year that ends on the Friday closest to November 30. Our financial results for fiscal \n2021 benefited from an extra week in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 due to our 52/53 week financial calendar whereby fiscal \n2021 was a 53-week year compared with fiscal 2022 and 2020 which were 52-week years.\nReclassifications\nCertain prior year amounts, which are not material, have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation in the \nConsolidated Balance Sheets and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenue is derived from the sale of cloud-enabled software subscriptions, cloud-hosted offerings, term-based, \nroyalty, and perpetual software licenses, associated software maintenance and support plans, consulting services, training and \ntechnical support. Most of our enterprise customer arrangements involve multiple promises to our customers.\nRevenue is recognized when a contract exists between us and a customer and upon transfer of control of promised \nproducts or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those \nproducts or services. We enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which may be \nTable of Contents\nADOBE INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n58\n\n\ncapable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations, or in the case of offerings such as cloud-\nenabled Creative Cloud and Document Cloud, accounted for as a single performance obligation.

Certain revenue arrangements provide customers with unilateral \ncancellation rights, or options to either renew monthly on-premise term-based licenses or use committed funds to purchase \nother Adobe products or services.\nFully hosted subscription services (SaaS) allow customers to access hosted software during the contractual term without \ntaking possession of the software. Cloud-hosted subscription services may be sold on a fee-per-subscription period basis or \nbased on consumption or usage.\nWe recognize revenue ratably over the contractual service term for hosted services that are priced based on a committed \nnumber of transactions where the delivery and consumption of the benefit of the services occur evenly over time, beginning on \nthe date the services associated with the committed transactions are first made available to the customer and continuing through \nthe end of the contractual service term. Over-usage fees and fees based on the actual number of transactions are billed in \naccordance with contract terms as these fees are incurred and are included in the transaction price of an arrangement as variable \nconsideration. Fees based on a number of transactions, where invoicing is aligned to the pattern of performance, customer \nbenefit and consumption, are typically accounted for utilizing the “as-invoiced” practical expedient. Revenue for subscriptions \nsold as a fee per period is recognized ratably over the contractual term as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes \nthe benefit of the underlying service.\nWhen cloud-enabled services are highly integrated and interrelated with on-premise software, such as in our cloud-\nenabled Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings, the individual components are not considered distinct and revenue is \nrecognized ratably over the subscription period for which the cloud-enabled services are provided.\nThe subscription support plans related to those customer arrangements whose revenues we classify as subscription \nrevenues represent stand-ready performance obligations. Revenue from these subscription support plans is recognized ratably \nover their respective contractual terms and classified as subscription revenue.\nLicenses for on-premise software may be purchased on a perpetual basis, as a subscription for a fixed period of time or \nbased on usage for certain of our OEM and royalty agreements.

Revenue from on-premise term license or term licensing arrangements with unilateral cancellation rights \nor monthly renewal options, and any associated maintenance and support, is classified as subscription revenue.\nOur services and other revenue is comprised primarily of fees related to consulting, training, maintenance and support for \ncertain on-premise licenses that are recognized at a point in time and our advertising offerings. We typically sell our consulting \ncontracts on a time-and-materials or fixed-fee basis. These revenues are recognized as the services are performed for time-and-\nmaterials contracts and on a relative performance basis for fixed-fee contracts. Training revenues are recognized as the services \nare performed. Our maintenance and support offerings, which entitle customers, partners and developers to receive desktop \nproduct upgrades and enhancements or technical support, depending on the offering, are generally recognized ratably over the \nterm of the arrangement. Our transaction-based advertising offerings, where fees are based on a number of impressions per \nmonth and invoicing is aligned to the pattern of performance, customer benefit and consumption, are typically accounted for \nutilizing the “as-invoiced” practical expedient.\nJudgments\nOur contracts with customers may include multiple goods and services. For example, some of our offerings include both \non-premise and/or on-device software licenses and cloud services.

In reaching this conclusion, we considered the nature of our \npromise to Creative Cloud and Document Cloud customers, which is to provide a complete end-to-end creative design or \ndocument workflow solution that operates seamlessly across multiple devices and teams. We fulfill this promise by providing \naccess to a solution that integrates cloud-based and on-premise/on-device features that, together through their integration, \nprovide functionalities, utility and workflow efficiencies that could not be obtained from either the on-premise/on-device \nsoftware or cloud services on their own.\nCloud-based features that are integral to our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings and that work together with \nthe on-premise/on-device s",

Individual products may have multiple values for standalone selling price depending on factors such as where they \nare sold and what channel they are sold through. Where standalone selling price may not be directly observable (e.g., the \nperformance obligation is not sold separately), we maximize the use of observable inputs by using information that may include \nreviewing pricing practices, performance obligations with similar customers and selling models.\nCapitalized costs to obtain a contract are amortized over the expected period of benefit, which we have determined, \nbased on analysis, to be 5 years. We evaluated qualitative and quantitative factors to determine the period of amortization, \nincluding contract length, renewals, customer life and the useful lives of our products and acquired products. When the \nexpected period of benefit of an asset which would be capitalized is less than one year, we expense the amount as incurred, \nutilizing the practical expedient. We regularly evaluate whether there have been changes in the underlying assumptions and data \nused to determine the amortization period. \nWhen revenue arrangements include components of third-party goods and services, for example in transactions which \ninvolve resale, fulfillment or providing advertising impressions to our end customer, we evaluate whether we are the principal, \nand report revenues on a gross basis, or an agent, and report revenues on a net basis. In this assessment, we consider if we \nobtain control of the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer by evaluating indicators such as \nwhich party is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the goods or services, which party has discretion in \nestablishing price and the underlying terms and conditions between the parties to the transaction.\nWe offer limited rights of return, rebates and price protection of our products under various policies and programs with \nour distributors, resellers and/or ",

This estimate can be affected by the amount of a particular product in the channel, the rate of sell-through, \nproduct plans and other factors.\nAlthough our subscription contracts are generally non-cancellable, a limited number of customers have the right to \ncancel their contracts by providing prior written notice to us of their intent to cancel the remainder of the contract term and \nconsumers have a period of time to terminate certain agreements without penalty. In the event a customer cancels their contract, \nthey are generally not entitled to a refund for prior services we have provided to them. Contracts that include termination rights \nwithout substantive penalty are accounted for as contracts only for the committed period. Periods of time after the right of \ntermination are accounted for as optional purchases when they do not represent material rights. For certain of our usage-based \nlicense agreements, typically in our royalty and OEM businesses, reporting may be received after the end of a fiscal period.

In certain of our lease arrangements, \nprimarily those related to our data center arrangements, judgment is required in determining if a contract contains a lease. For \nthese arrangements, there is judgment in evaluating if the arrangement involves an identified asset that is physically distinct or \nwhether we have the right to substantially all of the capacity of an identified asset that is not physically distinct. In \narrangements that involve an identified asset, there is also judgment in evaluating if we have the right to direct the use of that \nasset. \nWe do not have any finance leases. Operating leases are recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Right-of-use \n(“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities are measured at the lease commencement date based on the present value of the remaining \nlease payments over the lease term, determined using the discount rate for the lease at the commencement date. Because the rate \nimplicit in our leases is not readily determinable, we use our incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate, which \napproximates the interest rate at which we could borrow on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments and in \nsimilar economic environments. As of December 2, 2022, our leases had remaining lease terms of up to 9 years, some of which \nincluded options to extend the lease for up to 14 years and options to terminate the lease within 1 year. Optional periods to \nextend the lease, including by not exercising a termination option, are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain \nthat the option will be exercised. We also have one land lease that expires in 2091. Operating lease expense is recognized on a \nstraight-line basis over the lease term. We account for lease and non-lease components, principally common area maintenance \nfor our facilities leases, as a single lease component for our facilities and data center leases. \nIn accordance with accounting requirements, leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are recorded on the balance \nsheet, with lease expense for these leases recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

We regularly review contract asset balances for impairment, considering factors such as historical experience, credit-\nworthiness, age of the balance, current economic conditions and a reasonable and supportable forecast of future economic \nconditions. Contract asset impairments were not material in fiscal 2022 and 2021. Contract assets were $97 million and $85 \nmillion as of December 2, 2022 and December 3, 2021, respectively.\nDeferred Revenue and Remaining Performance Obligations\nDeferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from \nsubscription services, including non-cancellable and non-refundable committed funds and refundable customer deposits. \nDeferred revenue is recognized as revenue when transfer of control to customers has occurred. Customers are typically invoiced \nfor these agreements in regular installments and revenue is recognized ratably over the contractual subscription period. The \ndeferred revenue balance is influenced by several factors, including the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, \ninvoice timing, size and new business linearity within the quarter. Deferred revenue does not represent the total contract value \nof annual or multi-year non-cancellable subscription agreements. \nPayment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within \n30 to 60 days. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined \nour contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to \nprovide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services, such as invoicing at the \nbeginning of a subscription term with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, and not to receive financing from our \ncustomers. Any potential financing fees are considered insignificant in the context of our contracts.\nAs of December 2, 2022, the balance of deferred revenue was $5.41 billion, which includes $99 million of refundable \ncustomer deposits. Refundable customer deposits represent arrangements in which the customer has a unilateral cancellation \nright for which we are obligated to refund amounts paid related to products or services not yet delivered or provided at the time \nof cancellation on a prorated basis.

Significant movements in the deferred \nrevenue balance during the period consisted of increases due to payments received prior to transfer of control of the underlying \nperformance obligations to the customer and deferred revenue assumed through acquisition, which were offset by decreases due \nto revenue recognized in the period.

We applied practical expedients to exclude amounts related to performance obligations that \nare billed and recognized as they are delivered, optional purchases that do not represent material rights, sales- and usage-based \nroyalties not yet consumed and any estimated amounts of variable consideration that are subject to constraint. \nRemaining performance obligations were approximately $15.19 billion as of December 2, 2022. Non-cancellable and \nnon-refundable committed funds related to some of our enterprise customer agreements referred to in the paragraph above \ncomprised approximately 5% of the total remaining performance obligations. Approximately 72% of the remaining \nperformance obligations, excluding the aforementioned enterprise customer agreements, are expected to be recognized over the \nnext 12 months with the remainder recognized thereafter.\nContract Acquisition Costs\nWe recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefit of those \ncosts to be longer than one year. We have determined that certain sales incentive programs meet the requirements to be \ncapitalized. \nThe costs capitalized are primarily sales commissions paid to our sales force personnel.

The combined amount of accrued interest and penalties included in long-term income taxes payable related to tax \npositions taken on our tax returns were approximately $17 million and $22 million for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nWhile we file federal, state and local income tax returns globally, our major tax jurisdictions are Ireland, California and \nthe United States. We are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by various domestic and foreign tax authorities \nwith 2018 being the earliest fiscal year open for examination in all of our major tax jurisdictions. We regularly assess the \nlikelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have \nreserved for potential adjustments that may result from these examinations. We believe our tax estimates to be reasonable; \nhowever, we cannot provide assurance that the final determination of any of these examinations will not have an adverse effect \non our financial position and results of operations.\nThe timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax \npayments that are part of any audit settlement process. These events could cause large fluctuations in the balance sheet \nclassification of our tax assets and liabilities. We believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either \ncertain audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. Although \nthe timing of resolution, settlement and closing of audits is not certain, it is reasonably possible that the underlying \nunrecognized tax benefits may decrease by up to $25 million over the next 12 months.\nNOTE 11.

Our performance \nshare awards which are contingent upon achievement of relative total stockholder return are valued using a Monte Carlo \nSimulation model. Our performance share awards which are contingent upon achievement of revenue-based financial metrics \nare valued based on the fair market value of the award on the grant date.\n We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of ESPP purchase rights.

Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by \nmanagement, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal \ncontrol over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the \nrisk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based \non the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the \ncircumstances.

However, we can infer the revenue growth and ARR growth, but not the operating margin. The excerpt does mention the ARR growth for Creative Cloud and Document Cloud, but it does not provide the operating income or operating expenses to calculate the operating margin.\n   Citation: The excerpt does not provide any information on operating margin.\n\n### Chunk # 62\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n\n### Chunk # 63\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`63`):\n   Answer: None\n   Explanation: The operating margin for Adobe in FY2022 cannot be directly extracted from the provided text, but we can infer the operating income from the net income and the revenue. However, the exact operating margin is not provided.\n   Citation: Digital Experience revenue was $4.42 billion in fiscal 2022, up from $3.87 billion in fiscal 2021 which represents 14% year-over-year growth.\n\n### Chunk # 64\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`64`):\n   Answer: Unfortunately, the provided text does not explicitly state the operating income for FY2022. However, we can infer that the operating margin for FY2022 is likely lower than FY2021, as the operating expenses increased by 15% while the revenue increased by 12%. We can calculate the operating margin for FY2021 as follows: (Total Revenue - Operating Expenses) / Total Revenue. For FY2021, the total revenue was $15.785 billion and the operating expenses were $8.12 billion. Therefore, the operating income for FY2021 is $7.665 billion. The operating margin for FY2021 is ($7.665 billion / $15.785 billion) * 100% ≈ 48.5%. Without the operating income for FY2022, we cannot calculate the operating margin for FY2022.\n   Explanation: To find the operating margin for Adobe for FY2022, we need to identify the operating income and total revenue for the year. We can then calculate the operating margin as a percentage of total revenue.\n   Citation: Operating expenses of $9.34 billion increased by $1.23 billion, or 15%, during fiscal 2022, from $8.12 billion in fiscal 2021 primarily due to increases in base and incentive compensation and related benefits costs, as well as increased marketing spend.\n\n### Chunk # 65\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`65`):\n   Answer: Unfortunately, we cannot calculate the operating margin for Adobe for FY2022 without the necessary information such as operating income or revenue. However, we can calculate the operating margin for each segment based on the given data.\n   Explanation: The operating margin for Adobe for FY2022 cannot be directly extracted from the provided text, as it does not include the necessary information such as operating income or revenue. However, we can infer the revenue for each segment and calculate the operating margin based on the given data.\n   Citation: Segment Information (dollars in millions)\n2022\n2021\n2020\n% Change\n2022-2021\nDigital Media\n$ 12,842 \n$ 11,520 \n$ 9,233 \n 11 %\nPercentage of total revenue\n 73 %\n 73 %\n 72 %\nDigital Experience\n$ 4,422 \n$ 3,867 \n$ 3,125 \n 14 %\nPercentage of total revenue\n 25 %\n 24 %\n 24 %\nPublishing and Advertising\n$ 342 \n$ 398 \n$ 510 \n (14) %\nPercentage of total revenue\n 2 %\n 3 %\n 4 %\n\n### Chunk # 66\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`66`):\n   Answer: The operating margin for Adobe for FY2022 is not directly provided in the given excerpt. However, we can calculate the gross margin for FY2022 as (17,606 - 2,165) / 17,606 = 87.8%. To calculate the operating margin, we would need additional information such as operating income. However, based on the provided information, we can see that the gross margin for FY2022 is 87.8%, which is an increase from FY2021's gross margin of (15,785 - 1,865) / 15,785 = 88.1% and FY2020's gross margin of (12,868 - 1,722) / 12,868 = 86.7%. This suggests that the operating margin for FY2022 is likely higher than FY2021 and FY2020, but the exact value is not provided.\n   Explanation: The operating margin can be calculated by dividing the total revenue by the total cost of revenue. This will provide the gross margin, and then the operating margin can be calculated by subtracting the cost of revenue from the total revenue and dividing by the total revenue.\n   Citation: Total revenue\n$ 17,606 \n$ 15,785 \n$ 12,868 \n\nTotal cost of revenue\n$ 2,165 \n$ 1,865 \n$ 1,722 \n\n### Chunk # 67\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`67`):\n   Answer: The operating margin for Adobe for FY2022 is approximately 1 - (9433 / Total Revenue) * 100. However, without the total revenue, we cannot provide an exact percentage. For FY2021, the operating margin would be approximately 1 - (8118 / Total Revenue) * 100, and for FY2020, it would be approximately 1 - (6909 / Total Revenue) * 100.\n   Explanation: The operating margin is calculated by dividing the operating income by the total revenue. However, the provided text does not explicitly mention the operating income or the total revenue. Instead, it provides the total operating expenses and the cost of revenue for each segment. To estimate the operating margin, we can use the total operating expenses and the cost of revenue to calculate the operating income and then divide it by the total revenue.\n   Citation: Total operating expenses: $9,343 (2022), $8,118 (2021), $6,909 (2020)\nTotal revenue: Not explicitly mentioned, but can be inferred from the context.\n\n### Chunk # 68\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`68`):\n   Answer: Unfortunately, we cannot accurately calculate the operating margin for Adobe for FY2022 based on the provided information. However, we can estimate the operating margin by making some assumptions. Let's assume the total operating expenses for FY2022 are the sum of sales and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses. Based on the provided text, the total operating expenses for FY2022 would be approximately $1.4 billion (sales and marketing expenses: $1.1 billion, general and administrative expenses: $0.3 billion). The total non-operating income (expense) for FY2022 is -$90 million. Assuming the total revenue for FY2022 is approximately $15.8 billion (based on Adobe's FY2022 revenue), the operating margin would be approximately 8.7% ((15.8 - 1.4 - 0.09) / 15.8). However, please note that this is an estimate and may not reflect the actual operating margin for Adobe for FY2022.\n   Explanation: The operating margin can be calculated by subtracting the total operating expenses from the total revenue and then dividing by the total revenue. However, the provided text does not explicitly mention the total revenue for FY2022. We can infer the operating margin from the provided information on operating expenses and non-operating income (expense), but we will need to make some assumptions.\n   Citation: Total operating expenses (sales and marketing expenses + general and administrative expenses) for FY2022 can be estimated by adding the sales and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses. However, the provided text does not explicitly mention the total operating expenses for FY2022.\n\n### Chunk # 69\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`69`):\n   Answer: The operating margin for FY2022 is not directly provided, but we can calculate it as (1 - (1,252 / total revenue)) * 100% or (1 - (1,252 / 17,420)) * 100% = 92.9% (assuming total revenue is $17,420 million). For FY2021, the operating margin is (1 - (883 / 14,516)) * 100% = 93.9%. For FY2020, the operating margin is (1 - (1,084 / 11,506)) * 100% = 90.5%.\n   Explanation: The operating margin is not directly provided in the given excerpt, but we can calculate it using the given information about revenue and net income.\n   Citation: Provision for (benefit from) income taxes\n$ 1,252 \n$ 883 \n$ (1,084) \n 42 %\nPercentage of total revenue\n 7 %\n 6 %\n (8) %  \nEffective tax rate\n 21 %\n 15 %\n (26) %  \n\n### Chunk # 70\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`70`):\n   Answer: Unfortunately, the operating margin for Adobe for FY2022, FY2021, and FY2020 is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. However, we can estimate the effective tax rate for FY2022 as follows: The gross liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties were $321 million, and if the total unrecognized tax benefits were recognized, $203 million would decrease the effective tax rate. However, without more information, we cannot accurately calculate the operating margin.\n   Explanation: The operating margin is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text, but we can infer the effective tax rate, which is related to the operating margin. We can use the information about unrecognized tax benefits and their impact on the effective tax rate to estimate the operating margin.\n   Citation: If the total unrecognized tax benefits as of December 2, 2022, December 3, 2021, and November 27, 2020 were recognized, $203 million, $199 million, and $136 million would decrease the respective effective tax rates.\n\n### Chunk # 71\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`71`):\n   Answer: The net cash provided by operating activities for FY2022 was $7.84 billion, which is an increase from $7.23 billion in FY2021 and $5.73 billion in FY2020.\n   Explanation: The operating margin for Adobe can be calculated by dividing the net cash provided by operating activities by the revenue. However, the revenue figure is not provided in the given excerpt. Therefore, we can only compare the net cash provided by operating activities for FY2022 and previous years.\n   Citation: Net cash provided by operating activities $7,838 $7,230 $5,727\n\n### Chunk # 72\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`72`):\n   Answer: None\n   Explanation: The operating margin for Adobe for FY2022 is not explicitly stated in the provided document excerpt. However, we can infer that the company's cash flows from operations could be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including risks detailed in the section titled 'Risk Factors' in Part I, Item 1A of this report.\n   Citation: Cash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, risks detailed in the section titled 'Risk Factors' in Part I, Item 1A of this report.\n\n### Chunk # 73\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n\n### Chunk # 74\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`74`):\n   Answer: None\n   Explanation: The operating margin for Adobe for FY2022 is not explicitly stated in the provided document excerpt. However, we can infer that the company's effective tax rate will be impacted by the U.S. Tax Act and the Inflation Reduction Act, which may affect their operating margin.\n   Citation: If not modified, we anticipate an adverse impact to our effective rates for income taxes paid, which will be partially offset by the increase in the foreign-derived intangible income deduction, for fiscal 2023 and beyond.\n\n### Chunk # 75\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`75`):\n   Answer: None\n   Explanation: The operating margin for Adobe for FY2022 is not directly provided in the given excerpt. However, we can infer that the company does not disclose significant costs related to indemnification provisions, which might indicate a stable or increasing operating margin.\n   Citation: Historically, costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations.\n\n### Chunk # 76\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n\n### Chunk # 77\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`77`):\n   Answer: None\n   Explanation: The operating margin for Adobe for FY2022 is not directly provided in the given excerpt. However, we can infer that the company's operating expenses are affected by the reclassification of gains or losses from cash flow hedges. Unfortunately, we cannot determine the exact operating margin without access to the company's financial statements or additional information.\n\n### Chunk # 78\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`78`):\n   Answer: Unfortunately, the operating income is not directly provided in the given excerpt. However, we can calculate the operating income for FY2022 as follows:\nTotal Revenue (FY2022) = $17,606 million\nCost of Revenue (FY2022) = $1,860 + $532 + $686 = $3,078 million\nOperating Income (FY2022) = Total Revenue - Cost of Revenue = $17,606 - $3,078 = $14,528 million\nOperating Margin (FY2022) = Operating Income / Total Revenue = $14,528 / $17,606 ≈ 0.823 or 82.3%\n\nFor previous years, we can calculate the operating income and margin as follows:\n\nFY2021:\nTotal Revenue (FY2021) = $15,785 million\nCost of Revenue (FY2021) = $1,954 + $555 + $657 = $3,166 million\nOperating Income (FY2021) = Total Revenue - Cost of Revenue = $15,785 - $3,166 = $12,619 million\nOperating Margin (FY2021) = Operating Income / Total Revenue = $12,619 / $15,785 ≈ 0.802 or 80.2%\n\nFY2020:\nTotal Revenue (FY2020) = $12,868 million\nCost of Revenue (FY2020) = $1,878 + $507 + $735 = $3,120 million\nOperating Income (FY2020) = Total Revenue - Cost of Revenue = $12,868 - $3,120 = $9,748 million\nOperating Margin (FY2020) = Operating Income / Total Revenue = $9,748 / $12,868 ≈ 0.758 or 75.8%\n\nTherefore, the operating margin for Adobe for FY2022 is approximately 82.3%, which is higher than the operating margins for FY2021 (80.2%) and FY2020 (75.8%).\n   Explanation: To calculate the operating margin, we need to find the operating income and total revenue for each year. The operating income can be found by subtracting the cost of revenue from the total revenue. Then, we can calculate the operating margin by dividing the operating income by the total revenue.\n   Citation: The relevant information is not directly provided in the given excerpt, but we can infer the operating income and revenue from the Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\n### Chunk # 79\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`79`):\n   Answer: The operating margin for FY2022 is 281.1% ($6,098 million / $2,165 million). For FY2021, it is 311.4% ($5,802 million / $1,865 million). For FY2020, it is 246.1% ($4,237 million / $1,722 million).\n   Explanation: To find the operating margin, we need to divide the operating income by the total revenue and express it as a percentage. We will compare the operating margin for FY2022 with the previous years.\n   Citation: Operating income for FY2022: $6,098 million, Operating income for FY2021: $5,802 million, Operating income for FY2020: $4,237 million.

However, the total revenue is not provided in the given excerpt. We can only find the net income for each year. Therefore, we will not be able to calculate the operating margin directly. However, we can find the net income and compare it with the previous years.\n   Citation: Net income for FY2022: $4,756; Net income for FY2021: $4,822; Net income for FY2020: $5,260\n\n### Chunk # 81\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n\n### Chunk # 82\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`82`):\n   Answer: None\n   Explanation: The operating margin for Adobe for FY2022 is not explicitly stated in the provided text. However, we can infer that the company's financial results for fiscal 2021 benefited from an extra week, but the impact of this on the operating margin is not mentioned. We can also see that the company has reclassified certain prior year amounts, but the impact of this on the operating margin is not clear.\n   Citation: Our financial results for fiscal 2021 benefited from an extra week in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 due to our 52/53 week financial calendar whereby fiscal 2021 was a 53-week year compared with fiscal 2022 and 2020 which were 52-week years.\n\n### Chunk # 83\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n\n### Chunk # 84\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n\n### Chunk # 85\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`85`):\n   Answer: None\n   Explanation: The provided text does not contain specific figures related to Adobe's operating margin for FY2022 or previous years. However, it does provide information on how Adobe determines its standalone selling price and capitalized costs to obtain a contract, which can be related to revenue and expenses.\n\n### Chunk # 86\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`86`):\n   Answer: None\n   Explanation: The operating margin for Adobe for FY2022 and previous years is not explicitly stated in the provided document excerpt. However, we can infer that the company maintains revenue reserves for rebates, rights of return, and other limited price adjustments, which may impact its operating margin.\n   Citation: We maintain revenue reserves for rebates, rights of return and other limited price adjustments.\n\n### Chunk # 87\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n\n### Chunk # 88\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`88`):\n   Answer: None\n   Explanation: The operating margin for Adobe for FY2022 is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. However, we can infer that the company's financial performance is good based on the fact that the qualitative assessment for goodwill impairment test indicates that the fair value of each reporting unit substantially exceeds the respective carrying amounts.\n   Citation: We determined, after performing a qualitative review of each reporting unit, that it is more likely than not that the fair value of each of our reporting units substantially exceeds the respective carrying amounts.\n\n### Chunk # 89\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`89`):\n   Answer: None\n   Explanation: The operating margin is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text.

However, we cannot directly calculate the operating margin without the operating expenses. Therefore, we can only infer that the operating margin is likely lower than the gross profit margin due to the presence of operating expenses.\n   Explanation: The operating margin is calculated by subtracting the cost of revenue from the revenue and then dividing by the revenue. However, since the provided document excerpt does not explicitly mention the operating expenses, we can infer the operating margin from the gross profit margin and the fact that the operating expenses are not reviewed on a segment-by-segment basis.\n   Citation: Our Chief Executive Officer, the chief operating decision maker, reviews revenue and gross margin information for each of our reportable segments, but does not review operating expenses on a segment by segment basis.\n\n### Chunk # 93\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`93`):\n   Answer: The gross margin for FY2022 was 96%, and it was 64% in FY2021 and 52% in FY2020.\n   Explanation: The operating margin can be calculated by dividing the gross profit by the revenue and then subtracting the operating expenses from the result. However, the provided text does not explicitly mention the operating expenses. Therefore, we can only calculate the gross margin, which is the gross profit as a percentage of revenue.\n   Citation: 96 % 64 % 52 % 87 %\n\n### Chunk # 94\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n\n### Chunk # 95\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n\n### Chunk # 96\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`96`):\n   Answer: None\n   Explanation: The operating margin for Adobe can be calculated by dividing the sales and marketing expense by the total revenue and then subtracting the result from 1. However, the exact operating margin for FY2022 and previous years is not directly provided in the given text. We can only find the amortized capitalized contract acquisition costs, which are a part of the sales and marketing expense.\n   Citation: During fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, we amortized $238 million, $212 million and $186 million of capitalized contract acquisition costs into sales and marketing expense, respectively.\n\n### Chunk # 97\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`97`):\n   Answer: None\n   Explanation: The operating margin for Adobe for FY2022 cannot be directly extracted from the provided text.

However, we can infer that the company did not recognize an allowance for credit-related losses on any of its investments during fiscal 2022 and 2021, which suggests that the company's financial performance was stable.\n   Citation: r not a credit loss exists. During fiscal 2022 and 2021, we did not recognize an allowance for credit-related losses on any of our investments.\n\n### Chunk # 100\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n\n### Chunk # 101\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n\n### Chunk # 102\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`102`):\n   Answer: None\n   Explanation: The operating margin is not directly provided in the given excerpt, but we can infer it from the information about gains (losses) on derivative instruments, net of tax, recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\n   Citation: Gains (losses) on derivative instruments, net of tax, recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:\n(in millions)\n2022\n2021\n2020\nDerivatives in cash flow hedging relationships:\nForeign exchange option contracts\n$ 144 \n$ 69 \n$ (43) \nForeign exchange forward contracts\n$ (5) \n$ — \n$ — \nTreasury lock\n$ — \n$ — \n$ (1) \n\n### Chunk # 103\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`103`):\n   Answer: None\n   Explanation: The operating margin for Adobe can be calculated by dividing the operating income by the revenue. However, the operating income is not directly provided in the given excerpt. We can infer the operating income from the net income and other income (expense), net. The net income is not provided, but we can use the information from the income statement to calculate the operating income.\n   Citation: cts\nOther income (expense), net\n$ \n(29) $ \n(3) $ \n5 \nTable of Contents\nADOBE INC.\n NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n74\n\n### Chunk # 104\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`104`):\n   Answer: To calculate the operating margin, we need to know the operating income. Unfortunately, the provided text does not contain this information. However, we can calculate the operating income by subtracting the total amortization expense from the income before income taxes. For FY2022, the total amortization expense is not directly mentioned, but we can infer it from the total expected amortization expense in Note 1, which is $1,430. However, this figure is not directly related to the income before income taxes. Therefore, we cannot accurately calculate the operating margin for FY2022 or previous years.\n   Explanation: The operating margin is not directly mentioned in the provided text. However, we can infer the operating margin by analyzing the income before income taxes and the income tax expense.\n   Citation: Income before income taxes for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 consisted of the following: (in millions) 2022 $ 6,008 $ 5,705 $ 4,176 ... Provision for (benefit from) income taxes $ 1,252 $ 883 $ (1,084)\n\n### Chunk # 105\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`105`):\n   Answer: Unfortunately, we cannot calculate the exact operating margin for FY2022 without the revenue figure. However, we can estimate the net income by using the provision for (benefit from) income taxes. Assuming the provision for (benefit from) income taxes is a reasonable estimate of the net income, we can use the figure for FY2022 ($1,252 million) to estimate the operating margin. However, without the revenue figure, we cannot provide an exact operating margin percentage. For previous years, the operating margin can be inferred from the net income and revenue figures, but they are not provided in the text.\n   Explanation: The operating margin for Adobe can be calculated by dividing the net income by the revenue. However, the provided text does not directly provide the revenue or net income figures for FY2022. Instead, it provides the provision for (benefit from) income taxes, which can be used to infer the net income. We will use this figure to estimate the operating margin.\n   Citation: $ 1,252 $ 883 $ (1,084) Provision for (benefit from) income taxes\n\n### Chunk # 106\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`106`):\n   Answer: None\n   Explanation: The operating margin for Adobe is not directly mentioned in the provided excerpt.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 78\n\n### Chunk # 107\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`107`):\n   Answer: None\n   Explanation: The operating margin for Adobe is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. However, we can infer that the company's operating income is not directly related to the deferred compensation plans or stock-based compensation programs discussed in the text.\n\n### Chunk # 108\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n\n### Chunk # 109\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`109`):\n   Answer: None\n   Explanation: The operating margin is not directly mentioned in the provided excerpt. However, we can infer that the company's stock-based compensation cost is a significant expense, which may impact the operating margin.\n   Citation: Valuation of Stock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award.\n\n### Chunk # 110\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n\n### Chunk # 111\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`111`):\n   Answer: We can calculate the operating income for each year by subtracting the total stock-based compensation costs from the total revenue. However, since the total revenue is not provided, we can only calculate the operating income margin as a percentage of the total stock-based compensation costs. For FY2022, the operating income margin is approximately 100% (1,440 / 1,440). For FY2021, the operating income margin is approximately 100% (1,090 / 1,090). For FY2020, the operating income margin is approximately 100% (909 / 909).\n   Explanation: To calculate the operating margin, we need to find the total revenue and total operating income for each year. However, the provided text does not explicitly mention the total revenue. Therefore, we can only calculate the operating income margin, which is the ratio of operating income to total revenue.\n   Citation: Total stock-based compensation costs included in our Consolidated Statements of Income for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:\n(in millions)\n2022\n2021\n2020\nCost of revenue\n$ 97 $ 70 $ 61 \nResearch and development\n726 549 467 \nSales and marketing\n417 307 261 \nGeneral and administrative\n200 164 120 \nTotal (1)\n$ 1,440 $ 1,090 $ 909 \n\n\n### Chunk # 112\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n\n### Chunk # 113\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`113`):\n   Answer: None\n   Explanation: The operating margin is not directly provided in the given excerpt, but we can calculate it using the net income and revenue. However, the revenue figure is not available in the provided text.\n\n### Chunk # 114\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`114`):\n   Answer: None\n   Explanation: The operating margin for Adobe is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. However, we can infer that the company's results of operations are affected by various factors, including indemnification provisions and legal proceedings.\n   Citation: Historically, costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations.\n\n### Chunk # 115\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n\n### Chunk # 116\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n\n### Chunk # 117\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`117`):\n   Answer: None\n   Explanation: The operating margin for Adobe is not directly provided, but the operating lease expense for FY2022 is given as $121 million. However, this information is not sufficient to calculate the operating margin without knowing the total revenue for FY2022.\n   Citation: Operating lease expense was $121 million for fiscal 2022 and $119 million for both fiscal 2021 and 2020.\n\n### Chunk # 118\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`118`):\n   Answer: None\n   Explanation: To calculate the operating margin, we need to find the operating income and the total revenue for FY2022. However, the provided text does not explicitly mention the operating income for FY2022. We can find the non-operating income (expense) for FY2022, but we cannot directly calculate the operating margin without the operating income.\n   Citation: Non-operating income (expense) for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 included the following:\n(in millions)\n2022\n2021\n2020\nInterest expense\n$ (112) $ (113) $ (116) \nInvestment gains (losses), net:\n Realized investment gains\n$ 11 $ 9 $ 5 \nRealized investment losses\n$ (1)  —  (1) \nUnrealized investment gains (losses), net\n$ (29)  7  9 \nInvestment gains (losses), net\n$ (19) $ 16 $ 13 \nOther income (expense), net:\nInterest income\n$ 61 $ 17 $ 43 \nForeign exchange gains (losses)\n$ (21)  (17)  (2) \nOther\n$ 1  —  1 \nOther income (expense), net\n$ 41 $ — $ 42 \nNon-operating income (expense), net\n$ (90) $ (97) $ (61) \n\n### Chunk # 119\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n\n### Chunk # 120\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n\n### Chunk # 121\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`121`):\n   Answer: None\n   Explanation: The operating margin for Adobe for FY2022 is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text.
