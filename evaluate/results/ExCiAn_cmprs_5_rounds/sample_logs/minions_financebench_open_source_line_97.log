--- Question ---
Are JPM's gross margins historically consistent (not fluctuating more than roughly 2% each year)? If gross margins are not a relevant metric for a company like this, then please state that and explain why.

--- Predicted Answer ---
Gross margins are not a relevant metric for JPMorgan Chase, as it is a financial institution. Instead, metrics like net interest margin, return on assets, and efficiency ratio are more appropriate for assessing the bank's performance. The outputs did not provide historical data on gross margins, which aligns with the understanding that this metric is not applicable to JPM.

--- Ground Truth ---
['Since JPM is a financial institution, gross margin is not a relevant metric.']

--- Correctness Evaluation ---
Is correct: True
Confidence: 1.00
Reasoning: The predicted answer correctly states that gross margins are not a relevant metric for JPMorgan Chase, as it is a financial institution. It also provides additional context by mentioning more appropriate metrics for assessing the bank's performance, which aligns with the ground truth answer.
