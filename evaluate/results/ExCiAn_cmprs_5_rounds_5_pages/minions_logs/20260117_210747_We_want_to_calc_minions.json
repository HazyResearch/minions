      "output": "To calculate the FY2022 retention ratio for General Mills, focus on extracting specific data from the financial document. You need to locate the net income attributable to shareholders from the income statement and the total cash dividends paid from the cash flow statement. The retention ratio is calculated by subtracting the dividend payout ratio from 1, where the dividend payout ratio is the total cash dividends paid divided by the net income attributable to shareholders. Ensure you have the figures for the fiscal year 2022 and perform the calculation with precision, rounding the final result to two decimal places."

Instead, you can assign small, isolated tasks to a less capable worker model that sees only a single chunk of text at a time. Any cross-chunk or multi-document reasoning must be handled by you.\n\n## Your Job: Write Two Python Functions\n\n### FUNCTION #1: `prepare_jobs(context, prev_job_manifests, prev_job_outputs) -> List[JobManifest]`\n- Break the document(s) into chunks (using the provided chunking function, if needed). Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 12 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`. All **multi-chunk integration** or **global reasoning** is your responsibility here.\n- Return one **aggregated string** suitable for further supervisor inspection.\n\n\n\n## Relevant Pydantic Models\n\nThe following models are already in the global scope. **Do NOT redefine or re-import them.**\n\n### JobManifest Model\n```\nclass JobManifest(BaseModel):\n    chunk: str  # the actual text for the chunk of the document\n    task: str  # the actual task instruction for the small model\n    advice: str  # optional, any additional advice on how to perform the task\n\n    chunk_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    task_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    job_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n\n```\n\n### JobOutput Model\n```\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    citation: Optional[str]\n    answer: Optional[str]\n\n```\n\n## Function Signatures\n```\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        context (List[str]): A list of documents.

In most product categories, we compete not only with other widely advertised, branded products,\nbut also  with regional  brands and  with generic  and private label products  that are  generally sold  at lower prices. Internationally,  we\ncompete with both multi-national and local manufacturers, and each country includes a unique group of competitors.\n\n\n5\nRaw materials, ingredients, and packaging\nThe principal raw materials that  we use are grains  (wheat, oats,  and corn), dairy products, sugar, fruits, vegetable  oils, meats,  nuts,\nvegetables,  and  other  agricultural  products.  We  also  use  substantial  quantities  of  carton  board,  corrugated,  plastic,  and  metal\npackaging materials, operating supplies, and energy.  Most of these inputs for our domestic and Canadian operations are purchased\nfrom suppliers in the United States. In our other international operations, inputs that are not locally available in adequate supply may\nbe imported  from other countries. The  cost of  these inputs may fluctuate  widely due  to external  conditions such  as weather,  climate\nchange, product scarcity,  limited sources of supply,  commodity market fluctuations, currency fluctuations, trade tariffs, pandemics\n(including the COVID-19 pandemic), war, and changes in governmental agricultural and energy policies and regulations.

If we are not effective in hedging this volatility,  we may experience an increase in our costs of borrowing. Our\nbusiness could  also be negatively impacted if our suppliers or customers experience disruptions resulting from tighter capital and\ncredit markets or a slowdown in the general economy.\n \nWe may not have access to preferred sources of liquidity when needed or on terms we find acceptable, and our borrowing costs could\nincrease.  An  economic  or  credit  crisis  could  occur  and  impair  credit  availability  and our  ability  to  raise  capital  when needed.  A\ndisruption in the financial markets may have a negative effect on our derivative counterparties and could impair our banking or other\nbusiness partners, on whom we rely for access to capital and as counterparties to our derivative contracts.\n \nFrom time to time, we issue variable rate securities based on London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and enter into interest rate\nswaps that  contain a  variable element  based on  LIBOR. The  United Kingdom Financial  Conduct Authority intends  to phase  out the\nLIBOR rates associated with our outstanding variable rate securities and interest rate swaps by June 2023. The U.S. Federal Reserve\nhas selected the Secured Overnight Funding Rate (SOFR) as the preferred alternate rate to LIBOR.

We  believe\nachieving  that goal requires us to generate a consistent balance of net sales growth, margin  expansion, cash conversion, and cash\nreturn to shareholders over time.\nOur long-term growth objectives are to deliver the following performance on average over time:\n●\n2 to 3 percent annual growth in organic net sales;\n●\nmid-single-digit annual growth in adjusted operating profit;\n●\nmid- to high-single-digit annual growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS);\n●\nfree cash flow conversion of at least 95 percent of adjusted net earnings after tax; and\n●\ncash return to shareholders of 80 to 90 percent of free cash flow, including an attractive dividend yield.\nWe are executing  our Accelerate strategy to  drive sustainable,  profitable gro wth and top-tier shareholder  returns over  the long term. \nThe  strategy  focuses  on  four  pillars  to  create  competitive  advantages  and  win:  boldly  building  brands,  relentlessly  innovating,\nunleashing our scale,  and being a  force for  good. We  are prioritizing  our core  markets, global  platforms, and local gem  brands that\nhave  the  best  prospects  for  profitable  growth  and  we  are  committed  to  reshaping  our  portfolio  with  strategic  acquisitions  and\ndivestitures to further enhance our growth profile.\nWe expect that changes in consumer behaviors driven by the COVID-19 pandemic will result in ongoing elevated consumer demand\nfor food at home, relative to pre-pandemic levels. These changes include more time spent working from home and increased consumer\nappreciation for cooking  and baking.  We plan to  capitalize on  these opportunities,  addressing evolving  consumer needs through  our\nleading brands, innovation, and advantaged capabilities to generate profitable growth.\nIn fiscal 2022, we successfully adapted to the volatile operating environment, responding quickly to significant increases in input cost\ninflation and supply chain disruptions and keeping our brands available for our customers and consumers.  As a result, we were able to\ngrow organic net sales, adjuste",

The impact of this change was not material\nto our consolidated results of operations and, therefore, we did not restate prior period financial statements for comparability.  Our\nIndia business is on an April fiscal year end.  \nNOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nCash and Cash Equivalents \nWe consider all investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.\nInventories \nAll inventories in the United States other than grain are valued at the lower of cost, using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method, or\nmarket. Grain inventories are valued at net realizable value, and all related cash contracts and derivatives are valued at fair value, with\nall net changes in value recorded in earnings currently.\nInventories outside of the  United States are  generally valued at the lower  of cost, using  the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method,  or net\nrealizable value.\nShipping costs associated with the  distribution of finished product to our customers are recorded as  cost of sales and are recognized\nwhen the related finished product is shipped to and accepted by the customer.\nLand, Buildings, Equipment, and Depreciation \nLand is recorded at historical cost. Buildings and equipment, including capitalized interest and internal engineering costs, are recorded\nat cost and depreciated over estimated useful lives, primarily using the straight-line method. Ordinary maintenance and repairs are\ncharged  to  cost  of  sales.  Buildings  are  usually  depreciated  over 40  years,  and  equipment,  furniture,  and  software  are  usually\ndepreciated over 3 to 10 years. Fully depreciated assets are retained in buildings and equipment until disposal. When an item is sold or\nretired,  the  accounts  are  relieved  of  its  cost  and  related  accumulated  depreciation  and  the  resulting  gains  and  losses,  if  any,  are\nrecognized in earnings. \nLong-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an\nasset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash\nflows from  the operation  and disposition  of the  asset group  are less  than the  carrying amount  of the  asset group.  Asset groups  have\nidentifiable cash flows and are largely independent of other asset groups.  Measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the\nexcess of the carrying amount of  the asset group  over its fair  value. Fair value is measured  using a ",

We perform our annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment test as\nof the first day of the second quarter of the fiscal year.  Impairment testing is performed for each of our reporting units. We compare\nthe carrying value of a reporting unit, including goodwill, to the fair value of the unit. Carrying value is based on the assets and\nliabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit, which often requires allocation of shared or corporate items among\nreporting  units.  If  the  carrying  amount  of  a  reporting  unit  exceeds  its  fair  value,  impairment  has  occurred.  We  recognize  an\n\n\n51\nimpairment charge for the amount by which the carrying  amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value up to the total amount of\ngoodwill allocated  to the reporting unit.  Our estimates of fair  value are  determined based  on a  discounted cash flow  model. Growth\nrates for sales and profits are determined using inputs from our long-range planning process. We also make estimates of discount rates,\nperpetuity growth assumptions, market comparables, and other factors. \nWe evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets, mainly brands, to determine if they are finite or indefinite-lived. Reaching a\ndetermination  on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand,\ncompetition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry,  known technological advances, legislative action that results\nin an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance\nexpenditures,  and  the  expected  lives  of  other  related  groups  of  assets.  Intangible  assets  that  are  deemed  to  have  finite  lives  are\namortized on a straight-line basis, over their useful lives, generally ranging from 4 to 30 years.\nOur indefinite-lived intangible assets, mainly intangible assets primarily associated with the Blue Buffalo, Pillsbury, Totino’s , Old El\nPaso, Progresso, Annie’s , Häagen-Dazs, and Yoki brands, are also tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. Our estimate of the fair value of the brands is based on a\ndiscounted  cash flow model using inputs which included projected revenues from our long-range plan, assumed royalty rates that\ncould be payable if we did not own the brands, and a discount rate. \nOur finite-lived intangible assets, primarily acquired franchise agreements  and customer relationships, are reviewed for impairment\nwhenever events or  changes in circum",

Generally,  our lease\nagreements do not include an option to purchase the leased asset, residual value guarantees, or material restrictive covenants.\nWe  have certain lease arrangements with variable rental payments. Our lease arrangements for our Häagen-Dazs retail shops often\ninclude rental payments that are based on a percentage of retail sales. We  have other lease arrangements that are adjusted periodically\nbased on an inflation index or rate. The future variability of these payments and adjustments are unknown, and therefore they are not\nincluded  as minimum lease payments used to determine our right of use assets and lease liabilities. Variable  rental payments  are\nrecognized in the period in which the obligation is incurred. \nAs most of our lease arrangements do not provide an implicit interest rate, we apply an incremental borrowing rate based on the\ninformation available at the commencement date of the lease arrangement to determine the present value of lease payments.\nInvestments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures \nOur investments in companies over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence are stated at cost plus our share of\nundistributed earnings or losses. We  receive royalty income from certain joint ventures, incur various expenses (primarily research\nand development), and record the tax impact of certain joint venture operations that are structured as partnerships. In addition, we\nmake advances to our joint ventures in the form of loans or capital investments. We  also sell certain raw materials, semi-finished\ngoods, an",

We  recognize revenue for the sale of packaged foods at the point in time when our performance obligation\nhas been satisfied and control of the product has transferred to our customer, which generally occurs when the shipment is accepted by\nour customer.  Sales include  shipping and  handling charges  billed to  the customer  and are reported net of  variable consideration  and\nconsideration  payable  to  our  customers,  including  trade  promotion,  consumer  coupon  redemption  and  other  reductions  to  the\ntransaction price, including estimated allowances  for returns, unsalable  product, and prompt pay discounts. Sales, use,  value-added,\nand  other  excise  taxes  are  not  included  in  revenue.  Trade  promotions  are  recorded  using  significant  judgment  of  estimated\nparticipation and performance levels for offered programs at the time of sale. Differences between estimated and actual reductions to\nthe transaction  price are recognized  as a change in estimate in a subsequent  period. We  generally  do not allow a right of return.\nHowever, on a  limited case-by-case  basis with  prior approval, we  may allow customers  to return  product. In  limited circumstances,\nproduct  returned  in  saleable  condition  is  resold  to  other  customers  or  outlets.  Receivables  from  customers  generally  do  not  bear\ninterest. Payment terms and collection patterns vary around the world and by channel, and are short-term, and as such, we do not have\nany significant financing components. Our allowance for doubtful accounts represents our estimate of expected credit losses related to\nour  trade  receivables.  We  pool  our  trade  receivables  based  on  similar  risk  characteristics,  such  as  geographic  location,  business\nchannel, and other account data.

We  do not perform the assessments required to achieve\nhedge  accounting  for  commodity  derivative  positions.  Accordingly,  the  changes  in  the  values  of  these  derivatives  are  recorded\ncurrently in cost of sales in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. \nAlthough we do not meet the criteria for cash flow hedge accounting, we believe that these instruments are effective in achieving our\nobjective of providing certainty in the future price of commodities purchased for use in our supply chain. Accordingly, for purposes of\nmeasuring  segment  operating  performance  these  gains  and  losses  are  reported  in  unallocated  corporate  items  outside  of  segment\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n60\noperating results until such time that the exposure we are managing affects earnings.

RETIREMENT BENEFITS AND POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans \nWe have defined benefit pension plans covering many employees in the United States, Canada, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.\nBenefits for salaried employees are based on length of service and final average compensation. Benefits for hourly employees include\nvarious monthly amounts for each year of credited service. Our funding policy is consistent with the requirements of applicable laws.\nWe made no voluntary contributions to our principal U.S. plans in fiscal 2022 or fiscal 2021. We do not expect to be required to make\nany contributions to our principal U.S. plans in fiscal 2023. Our principal U.S. retirement plan covering salaried employees has a\nprovision that any excess pension assets would be allocated to active participants if the plan is terminated within five years of a change\nin control. All salaried employees hired on or after June 1, 2013, are eligible for a retirement program that does not include a defined\nbenefit pension plan. \nOther Postretirement Benefit Plans \nWe  also sponsor plans that provide health care benefits to many of our  retirees in the United  States, Canada, and Brazil. The U.S.\nsalaried  health  care benefit plan is contributory,  with retiree contributions  based  on years of  service. We  make decisions to  fund\nrelated trusts for certain employees and retirees on an annual basis. We made no voluntary contributions to these plans in fiscal 2022\nor fiscal 2021. We do not expect to be required to make any contributions to these plans in fiscal 2023.\nIn fiscal 2021, we approved amendments to reorganize certain U.S. retiree health and welfare benefit plans. The General Mills Retiree\nHealth Plan for Union  Employees was divided  into two plans, with participants  under age 65 remaining  within its coverage,  and\nparticipants age 65 and over covered by The General Mills Retiree Health Plan for Union Employees (65+).

The trend rates are applicable for calculations\nonly if the retirees’ benefits increase as a result of health care inflation. The ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually,  as necessary,  to\napproximate the current economic view on the rate of long-term inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium. Assumed\ntrend rates for health care costs have an important effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans.\nPostemployment Benefit Plans \nUnder certain  circumstances, we also provide accruable benefits, primarily severance,  to former or inactive employees in  the United\nStates,  Canada,  and  Mexico.  We  recognize  an  obligation  for  any  of  these  benefits  that  vest  or  accumulate  with  service.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

The\nNotes, therefore, are effectively subordinated to the claims of creditors, including trade creditors, of our subsidiaries, and to claims of\nowners of preferred equity of our subsidiaries. \n\n\n \n \nRedemption\n \nAs discussed below, we may redeem the Notes before they mature. The Notes to be redeemed will stop bearing interest on\nthe redemption date. We will give holders of Notes between 15 and 45 days’ notice before the redemption date.\n \nWe are not required (i) to register, transfer or exchange the Notes during the period from the opening of business 15 days\nbefore the day a notice of redemption relating to the Notes selected for redemption is sent to the close of business on the day that\nnotice is sent, or (ii) to register, transfer or exchange any Notes so selected for redemption, except for the unredeemed portion of any\nNotes being redeemed in part.\n \nWe may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time. The redemption price for the 2023 Notes to\nbe redeemed on any redemption date that is prior to January 27, 2023 (the date that is three months prior to the maturity date) will be\nequal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the 2023 Notes to be redeemed and (2) as determined by an independent\ninvestment bank selected by us, the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the\n2023 notes to be redeemed (excluding any portion of such payments of interest accrued as of the date of redemption) discounted to the\nredemption date on an annual basis (ACTUAL/ACTUAL (ICMA)) at the applicable Comparable Government Bond Rate (as defined\nbelow) plus 20 basis points, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption.

Internationally,  we\ncompete with both multi-national and local manufacturers, and each country includes a unique group of competitors.\n\n\n5\nRaw materials, ingredients, and packaging\nThe principal raw materials that  we use are grains  (wheat, oats,  and corn), dairy products, sugar, fruits, vegetable  oils, meats,  nuts,\nvegetables,  and  other  agricultural  products.  We  also  use  substantial  quantities  of  carton  board,  corrugated,  plastic,  and  metal\npackaging materials, operating supplies, and energy.  Most of these inputs for our domestic and Canadian operations are purchased\nfrom suppliers in the United States. In our other international operations, inputs that are not locally available in adequate supply may\nbe imported  from other countries. The  cost of  these inputs may fluctuate  widely due  to external  conditions such  as weather,  climate\nchange, product scarcity,  limited sources of supply,  commodity market fluctuations, currency fluctuations, trade tariffs, pandemics\n(including the COVID-19 pandemic), war, and changes in governmental agricultural and energy policies and regulations. We  believe\nthat we will be able to obtain an adequate supply of needed inputs. Occasionally and where possible, we make advance purchases of\nitems significant to our  business in  order to ensure  continuity of operations.  Our objective  is to  procure materials meeting both our\nquality standards  and our  production needs at price levels  that allow  a targeted  profit margin.  Since these inputs generally  represent\nthe largest variable cost in manufacturing our products, to the extent possible, we often manage the risk associated with adverse price\nmovements for some inputs using a variety of risk management strategies. We also have a grain merchandising operation that provides\nus efficient access to, and more informed knowledge of, various commodity markets, principally wheat and oats. This operation holds\nphysical inventories that are carried at net realizable value and uses derivatives to manage its net inventory position and minimize its\nmarket exposures.\nTRADEMARKS AND PATENTS\nOur  products  a",

We  believe\nachieving  that goal requires us to generate a consistent balance of net sales growth, margin  expansion, cash conversion, and cash\nreturn to shareholders over time.\nOur long-term growth objectives are to deliver the following performance on average over time:\n●\n2 to 3 percent annual growth in organic net sales;\n●\nmid-single-digit annual growth in adjusted operating profit;\n●\nmid- to high-single-digit annual growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS);\n●\nfree cash flow conversion of at least 95 percent of adjusted net earnings after tax; and\n●\ncash return to shareholders of 80 to 90 percent of free cash flow, including an attractive dividend yield.\nWe are executing  our Accelerate strategy to  drive sustainable,  profitable gro wth and top-tier shareholder  returns over  the long term. \nThe  strategy  focuses  on  four  pillars  to  create  competitive  advantages  and  win:  boldly  building  brands,  relentlessly  innovating,\nunleashing our scale,  and being a  force for  good. We  are prioritizing  our core  markets, global  platforms, and local gem  brands that\nhave  the  best  prospects  for  profitable  growth  and  we  are  committed  to  reshaping  our  portfolio  with  strategic  acquisitions  and\ndivestitures to further enhance our growth profile.\nWe expect that changes in consumer behaviors driven by the COVID-19 pandemic will result in ongoing elevated consumer demand\nfor food at home, relative to pre-pandemic levels. These changes include more time spent working from home and increased consumer\nappreciation for cooking  and baking.  We plan to  capitalize on  these opportunities,  addressing evolving  consumer needs through  our\nleading brands, innovation, and advantaged capabilities to generate profitable growth.\nIn fiscal 2022, we successfully adapted to the volatile operating environment, responding quickly to significant increases in input cost\ninflation and supply chain disruptions and keeping our brands available for our customers and consumers.  As a result, we were able to\ngrow organic net sales, adjuste",

The impact of this change was not material\nto our consolidated results of operations and, therefore, we did not restate prior period financial statements for comparability.  Our\nIndia business is on an April fiscal year end.  \nNOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nCash and Cash Equivalents \nWe consider all investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.\nInventories \nAll inventories in the United States other than grain are valued at the lower of cost, using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method, or\nmarket. Grain inventories are valued at net realizable value, and all related cash contracts and derivatives are valued at fair value, with\nall net changes in value recorded in earnings currently.\nInventories outside of the  United States are  generally valued at the lower  of cost, using  the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method,  or net\nrealizable value.\nShipping costs associated with the  distribution of finished product to our customers are recorded as  cost of sales and are recognized\nwhen the related finished product is shipped to and accepted by the customer.\nLand, Buildings, Equipment, and Depreciation \nLand is recorded at historical cost. Buildings and equipment, including capitalized interest and internal engineering costs, are recorded\nat cost and depreciated over estimated useful lives, primarily using the straight-line method. Ordinary maintenance and repairs are\ncharged  to  cost  of  sales.  Buildings  are  usually  depreciated  over 40  years,  and  equipment,  furniture,  and  software  are  usually\ndepreciated over 3 to 10 years. Fully depreciated assets are retained in buildings and equipment until disposal. When an item is sold or\nretired,  the  accounts  are  relieved  of  its  cost  and  related  accumulated  depreciation  and  the  resulting  gains  and  losses,  if  any,  are\nrecognized in earnings. \nLong-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an\nasset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash\nflows from  the operation  and disposition  of the  asset group  are less  than the  carrying amount  of the  asset group.  Asset groups  have\nidentifiable cash flows and are largely independent of other asset groups.  Measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the\nexcess of the carrying amount of  the asset group  over its fair  value. Fair value is measured  using a ",

We perform our annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment test as\nof the first day of the second quarter of the fiscal year.  Impairment testing is performed for each of our reporting units. We compare\nthe carrying value of a reporting unit, including goodwill, to the fair value of the unit. Carrying value is based on the assets and\nliabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit, which often requires allocation of shared or corporate items among\nreporting  units.  If  the  carrying  amount  of  a  reporting  unit  exceeds  its  fair  value,  impairment  has  occurred.  We  recognize  an\n\n\n51\nimpairment charge for the amount by which the carrying  amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value up to the total amount of\ngoodwill allocated  to the reporting unit.  Our estimates of fair  value are  determined based  on a  discounted cash flow  model. Growth\nrates for sales and profits are determined using inputs from our long-range planning process. We also make estimates of discount rates,\nperpetuity growth assumptions, market comparables, and other factors. \nWe evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets, mainly brands, to determine if they are finite or indefinite-lived. Reaching a\ndetermination  on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand,\ncompetition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry,  known technological advances, legislative action that results\nin an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance\nexpenditures,  and  the  expected  lives  of  other  related  groups  of  assets.  Intangible  assets  that  are  deemed  to  have  finite  lives  are\namortized on a straight-line basis, over their useful lives, generally ranging from 4 to 30 years.\nOur indefinite-lived intangible assets, mainly intangible assets primarily associated with the Blue Buffalo, Pillsbury, Totino’s , Old El\nPaso, Progresso, Annie’s , Häagen-Dazs, and Yoki brands, are also tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. Our estimate of the fair value of the brands is based on a\ndiscounted  cash flow model using inputs which included projected revenues from our long-range plan, assumed royalty rates that\ncould be payable if we did not own the brands, and a discount rate. \nOur finite-lived intangible assets, primarily acquired franchise agreements  and customer relationships, are reviewed for impairment\nwhenever events or  changes in circum",

Many of our lease arrangements provide\nus with options to exercise one or more renewal terms or to terminate the lease arrangement. We include these options when we are\nreasonably certain to exercise them in the lease term used to establish our right of use assets and lease liabilities. Generally,  our lease\nagreements do not include an option to purchase the leased asset, residual value guarantees, or material restrictive covenants.\nWe  have certain lease arrangements with variable rental payments. Our lease arrangements for our Häagen-Dazs retail shops often\ninclude rental payments that are based on a percentage of retail sales. We  have other lease arrangements that are adjusted periodically\nbased on an inflation index or rate. The future variability of these payments and adjustments are unknown, and therefore they are not\nincluded  as minimum lease payments used to determine our right of use assets and lease liabilities. Variable  rental payments  are\nrecognized in the period in which the obligation is incurred. \nAs most of our lease arrangements do not provide an implicit interest rate, we apply an incremental borrowing rate based on the\ninformation available at the commencement date of the lease arrangement to determine the present value of lease payments.\nInvestments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures \nOur investments in companies over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence are stated at cost plus our share of\nundistributed earnings or losses. We  receive royalty income from certain joint ventures, incur various expenses (primarily research\nand development), and record the tax impact of certain joint venture operations that are structured as partnerships. In addition, we\nmake advances to our joint ventures in the form of loans or capital investments. We  also sell certain raw materials, semi-finished\ngoods, an",

We  recognize revenue for the sale of packaged foods at the point in time when our performance obligation\nhas been satisfied and control of the product has transferred to our customer, which generally occurs when the shipment is accepted by\nour customer.  Sales include  shipping and  handling charges  billed to  the customer  and are reported net of  variable consideration  and\nconsideration  payable  to  our  customers,  including  trade  promotion,  consumer  coupon  redemption  and  other  reductions  to  the\ntransaction price, including estimated allowances  for returns, unsalable  product, and prompt pay discounts. Sales, use,  value-added,\nand  other  excise  taxes  are  not  included  in  revenue.  Trade  promotions  are  recorded  using  significant  judgment  of  estimated\nparticipation and performance levels for offered programs at the time of sale. Differences between estimated and actual reductions to\nthe transaction  price are recognized  as a change in estimate in a subsequent  period. We  generally  do not allow a right of return.\nHowever, on a  limited case-by-case  basis with  prior approval, we  may allow customers  to return  product. In  limited circumstances,\nproduct  returned  in  saleable  condition  is  resold  to  other  customers  or  outlets.  Receivables  from  customers  generally  do  not  bear\ninterest. Payment terms and collection patterns vary around the world and by channel, and are short-term, and as such, we do not have\nany significant financing components. Our allowance for doubtful accounts represents our estimate of expected credit losses related to\nour  trade  receivables.  We  pool  our  trade  receivables  based  on  similar  risk  characteristics,  such  as  geographic  location,  business\nchannel, and other account data.

We  do not perform the assessments required to achieve\nhedge  accounting  for  commodity  derivative  positions.  Accordingly,  the  changes  in  the  values  of  these  derivatives  are  recorded\ncurrently in cost of sales in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. \nAlthough we do not meet the criteria for cash flow hedge accounting, we believe that these instruments are effective in achieving our\nobjective of providing certainty in the future price of commodities purchased for use in our supply chain. Accordingly, for purposes of\nmeasuring  segment  operating  performance  these  gains  and  losses  are  reported  in  unallocated  corporate  items  outside  of  segment\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n60\noperating results until such time that the exposure we are managing affects earnings.

RETIREMENT BENEFITS AND POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans \nWe have defined benefit pension plans covering many employees in the United States, Canada, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.\nBenefits for salaried employees are based on length of service and final average compensation. Benefits for hourly employees include\nvarious monthly amounts for each year of credited service. Our funding policy is consistent with the requirements of applicable laws.\nWe made no voluntary contributions to our principal U.S. plans in fiscal 2022 or fiscal 2021. We do not expect to be required to make\nany contributions to our principal U.S. plans in fiscal 2023. Our principal U.S. retirement plan covering salaried employees has a\nprovision that any excess pension assets would be allocated to active participants if the plan is terminated within five years of a change\nin control. All salaried employees hired on or after June 1, 2013, are eligible for a retirement program that does not include a defined\nbenefit pension plan. \nOther Postretirement Benefit Plans \nWe  also sponsor plans that provide health care benefits to many of our  retirees in the United  States, Canada, and Brazil. The U.S.\nsalaried  health  care benefit plan is contributory,  with retiree contributions  based  on years of  service. We  make decisions to  fund\nrelated trusts for certain employees and retirees on an annual basis. We made no voluntary contributions to these plans in fiscal 2022\nor fiscal 2021. We do not expect to be required to make any contributions to these plans in fiscal 2023.\nIn fiscal 2021, we approved amendments to reorganize certain U.S. retiree health and welfare benefit plans. The General Mills Retiree\nHealth Plan for Union  Employees was divided  into two plans, with participants  under age 65 remaining  within its coverage,  and\nparticipants age 65 and over covered by The General Mills Retiree Health Plan for Union Employees (65+).

The trend rates are applicable for calculations\nonly if the retirees’ benefits increase as a result of health care inflation. The ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually,  as necessary,  to\napproximate the current economic view on the rate of long-term inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium. Assumed\ntrend rates for health care costs have an important effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans.\nPostemployment Benefit Plans \nUnder certain  circumstances, we also provide accruable benefits, primarily severance,  to former or inactive employees in  the United\nStates,  Canada,  and  Mexico.  We  recognize  an  obligation  for  any  of  these  benefits  that  vest  or  accumulate  with  service.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

The\nNotes, therefore, are effectively subordinated to the claims of creditors, including trade creditors, of our subsidiaries, and to claims of\nowners of preferred equity of our subsidiaries. \n\n\n \n \nRedemption\n \nAs discussed below, we may redeem the Notes before they mature. The Notes to be redeemed will stop bearing interest on\nthe redemption date. We will give holders of Notes between 15 and 45 days’ notice before the redemption date.\n \nWe are not required (i) to register, transfer or exchange the Notes during the period from the opening of business 15 days\nbefore the day a notice of redemption relating to the Notes selected for redemption is sent to the close of business on the day that\nnotice is sent, or (ii) to register, transfer or exchange any Notes so selected for redemption, except for the unredeemed portion of any\nNotes being redeemed in part.\n \nWe may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time. The redemption price for the 2023 Notes to\nbe redeemed on any redemption date that is prior to January 27, 2023 (the date that is three months prior to the maturity date) will be\nequal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the 2023 Notes to be redeemed and (2) as determined by an independent\ninvestment bank selected by us, the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the\n2023 notes to be redeemed (excluding any portion of such payments of interest accrued as of the date of redemption) discounted to the\nredemption date on an annual basis (ACTUAL/ACTUAL (ICMA)) at the applicable Comparable Government Bond Rate (as defined\nbelow) plus 20 basis points, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption.

Question to answer:\nWe want to calculate a financial metric. Please help us compute it by basing your answers off of the cash flow statement and the income statement. Here's the question: what is the FY2022 retention ratio (using total cash dividends paid and net income attributable to shareholders) for General Mills? Round answer to two decimal places.\n\n2.

      "output": "We have gathered information on both the net income attributable to shareholders and the total cash dividends paid for FY2022 for General Mills. \n\n1. **Net Income Attributable to Shareholders:**\n   - We have a figure of \\$2,707.3 million, which is clearly identified as the net earnings attributable to General Mills.\n\n2. **Total Cash Dividends Paid:**\n   - We have multiple mentions of \\$1,244.5 million as the total cash dividends paid, supported by several citations from different sections of the document, including the \"Cash Flows - Financing Activities\" section.\n\nThe information is sufficient to calculate the retention ratio. The retention ratio is calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Retention Ratio} = 1 - \\left(\\frac{\\text{Total Cash Dividends Paid}}{\\text{Net Income Attributable to Shareholders}}\\right)\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values we have:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Retention Ratio} = 1 - \\left(\\frac{1,244.5}{2,707.3}\\right)\n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Retention Ratio} = 1 - 0.4596 \\approx 0.54\n\\]\n\nThus, the FY2022 retention ratio for General Mills is approximately 0.54, or 54% when rounded to two decimal places. There are no conflicting answers for the net income or dividends that would affect this calculation."
