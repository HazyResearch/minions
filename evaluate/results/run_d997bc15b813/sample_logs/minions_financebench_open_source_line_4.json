  "question": "What drove operating margin change as of FY2022 for 3M? If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then please state that and explain why.",
  "predicted_answer": "3M's operating margin change in FY2022 was driven by several factors, including increased raw material and logistics costs, special item charges, supply chain disruptions, segment performance declines, foreign currency impacts, restructuring and divestiture actions, and changes in product demand. Extraordinary items such as litigation costs, divestiture-related restructuring actions, and PFAS manufacturing exit costs significantly impacted the margin. The operating income margin decreased from 22.3% in 2021 to 20.8% in 2022. Management's discussion highlights these challenges, particularly the impact of global supply chain issues and geopolitical tensions.",
  "ground_truth": [
    "Operating Margin for 3M in FY2022 has decreased by 1.7% primarily due to: \n-Decrease in gross Margin\n-mostly one-off charges including Combat Arms Earplugs litigation, impairment related to exiting PFAS manufacturing, costs related to exiting Russia and divestiture-related restructuring\ncharges"
